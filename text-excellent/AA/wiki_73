No. 79 Squadron RAAF

No. 79 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) flight training unit that has been formed on four occasions since 1943. The <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> was established in May 1943 as a fighter unit equipped with <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s, and subsequently saw combat in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre of World War II</a>. Between June 1943 and the end of the war in August 1945 it flew air defence patrols to protect Allied bases and ships, escorted Australian and United States aircraft, and attacked Japanese positions. The squadron was disbanded in November 1945, but was re-formed between 1962 and 1968 to operate <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>s from <a href="Ubon%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ubon Air Base</a> in Thailand. In this role it contributed to the defence of Thailand against a feared attack from its neighbouring states and exercised with <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> units. No. 79 Squadron was active again at <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a> in Malaysia between 1986 and 1988 where it operated <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Mirage III</a> fighters and a single <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a> transport during the period in which the RAAF's fighter squadrons were transitioning to new aircraft.

The squadron was re-formed in its present incarnation during 1998 and is currently stationed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a>, where it has operated <a href="Hawker-Siddeley%20Hawk">Hawk 127</a> jet training aircraft since 2000. The unit's main role is to provide introductory jet aircraft training to RAAF pilots as well as refresher training on the Hawk for experienced pilots. No. 79 Squadron also supports <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> training exercises in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>.

No. 79 Squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Laverton">RAAF Station Laverton</a> in Victoria on 26 April 1943 under the command of <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> Squadron Leader <a href="Alan%20Rawlinson">Alan Rawlinson</a>. The squadron's intended role was to use <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire%20%28early%20Merlin%20powered%20variants%29">Spitfire Vc</a> fighters to provide 'high cover' escort for the RAAF's <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>-equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea Campaign</a>. This requirement was considered urgent, and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, directed that No. 79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF's limited stock of Spitfires. The squadron moved to <a href="Wooloomanata%20Station">Wooloomanata Aerodrome</a> several days after it was formed, and received its first Spitfires on 3 May. While at Wooloomanata No. 79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat. The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron led to <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 Wing RAAF</a>, which was stationed near <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> and responsible for protecting the town against air attack, to suffer a shortage of these aircraft during June and July.
No. 79 Squadron began moving to <a href="Vivigani%20Airfield">Goodenough Island</a> in the war zone off the north coast of <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> in mid-May 1943. Its advance party departed Wooloomanata on 17 May, followed by the pilots on 4 June. The main body of ground crew sailed from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 7 June. The squadron suffered its first fatality on 13 June, when Flight Lieutenant <a href="Virgil%20Brennan">Virgil Brennan</a>—an experienced fighter pilot who had shot down 10 Axis aircraft over <a href="Malta">Malta</a>—died from wounds incurred when his Spitfire collided with another while they were landing at <a href="Cairns%2C%20Queensland">Cairns</a>. During the unit's transit to Goodenough Island, No. 79 Squadron Spitfires were <a href="Scrambling%20%28military%29">scrambled</a> from <a href="Gurney%20Airport">Gurney Airfield</a> at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> on several occasions between 19 and 25 June to intercept Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, but did not damage these intruders.
The squadron completed its movement to Goodenough Island on 26 June and began flying air defence <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s from there as part of <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing</a>. It did not intercept any Japanese aircraft while operating from this base, however. The squadron moved to <a href="Losuia%20Airport">Kirwina Airfield</a> on <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a> between 9 and 18 August, from where it operated alongside the P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a>. This was the closest Allied airfield to the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> and was expected to be regularly attacked. No Japanese raids were made on the airfield during the first weeks of the squadron's deployment there, however, and its pilots were disappointed to not see combat while conducting patrols in support of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) raids on Rabaul. The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Force">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a> (IJAAF) began a series of attacks on Goodenough Island and Kiriwina in early October, however, and the squadron claimed its first victory in 31 October when one of its Spitfires shot down a <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-61">Kawasaki Ki-61</a> fighter north of Kiriwina (this type of aircraft was <a href="World%20War%20II%20Allied%20names%20for%20Japanese%20aircraft">labelled</a> the "Tony" by the Allies).

After a period of training, No. 79 Squadron flew its first sweep over Japanese-held territory on 27 November when eight Spitfires were dispatched to <a href="Gasmata%20Airport">Gasmata</a> on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>. The next day one of its Spitfires shot down a <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-46">Mitsubishi Ki-46</a> "Dinah" reconnaissance aircraft south of <a href="Kitava">Kitava</a>. As few Japanese attacks were made against Kirwina, No. 79 Squadron's pilots became restive. The offensive patrols over New Britain improved their morale, however. Another Ki-61 was intercepted and shot down by a Spitfire on 21 December, and an <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">A6M Mitsubishi A6M</a> "Zero" fighter was destroyed on the ground at Gasmata seven days later. A Spitfire was lost during a patrol over New Britain on 31 December, however. During January and February 1944 the squadron conducted offensive sweeps over New Britain, strafed Japanese positions and escorted Allied bombers. On 17 January, eight No. 79 Squadron Spitfires took part in an attack against a Japanese camp near <a href="Lindenhafen">Lindenhafen</a> which involved 73 Australian aircraft; this was the largest RAAF operation of the war up to that time. Two Spitfires were lost during the operations in January and February.
In early 1944 No. 73 Wing was selected to support the US Army's <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">Admiralty Islands campaign</a>. The <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> began to land on the islands on 29 February, and the wing moved to <a href="Momote%20Airport">Momote Airstrip</a> on <a href="Los%20Negros%20Island">Los Negros Island</a> in March 1944. No. 79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month. From Momote, the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased. No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation. By the end of April, No. 79 Squadron's main role was to escort Allied shipping, though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts. The squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader M.S. Bott, was killed in an accident on 16 April. Shipping escort patrols continued in May, but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair. Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October, and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November. On 9 November, two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided <a href="Hyane%20Harbour">Hyane Harbour</a>; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack, the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area. No. 79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three-aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22 November. Two days later the squadron was released from operations ahead of moving to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in northern Australia to be re-equipped with more modern <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire%20%28late%20Merlin%20powered%20variants%29">Mark VIII Spitfires</a>.

No. 79 Squadron arrived at <a href="Sattler%20Airfield">Sattler Airfield</a> south of Darwin on 12 January 1945 and received its new aircraft shortly afterwards. It began to move to <a href="Leo%20Wattimena%20Airport">Morotai</a> in the <a href="Netherlands%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> (NEI) on 6 February and became operational there as part of <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 80 Wing</a> at the end of March. The squadron conducted ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on nearby islands until the end of the war and also became responsible for Morotai's air defence from 28 May. Although no Japanese aircraft were encountered in this area, several Spitfires were shot down by anti-aircraft fire during ground attack sorties. Operations were hindered at times by personnel shortages, and many of the airmen who were posted to the unit were judged by the squadron's commander to have been inadequately trained. On 30 July No. 80 Wing was disbanded and the squadron became the first flying unit assigned to the newly formed <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAAF">No. 11 Group</a>. This group was responsible for garrison duties in much of Borneo and the eastern NEI. No. 79 Squadron dropped leaflets on Japanese positions after Japan agreed to surrender on 15 August and returned to Australia in October 1945. It was disbanded at <a href="Oakey%20Army%20Aviation%20Centre">Oakey Airfield</a> on 12 November that year. The unit suffered 13 fatal casualties during the war. In late 2010 the squadron was awarded <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s for its World War II service in the Pacific, New Britain and Morotai.

In May 1962 the Australian Government decided to deploy a squadron of <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> fighters to Thailand to bolster that country's defences. This action was undertaken as part of Australia's <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO) commitment to defend Thailand against attack from its Communist neighbours, which was thought likely to occur. The United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces to Thailand in response to this perceived threat, though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved. On 28 May, Minister for Defence <a href="Athol%20Townley">Athol Townley</a> announced that Australia's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters. The eight aircraft, along with their pilots and ground crew, were drawn from <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a>, which formed part of Australia's <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Commonwealth Strategic Reserve</a> forces at <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a> in Malaysia. In order to preserve Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. This force was designated No. 79 Squadron while at <a href="Tengah%20Air%20Base">Tengah Air Base</a> in Singapore on 29 May.
The squadron arrived at <a href="Ubon%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ubon Air Base</a> in the <a href="Ubon%20Ratchathani%20Province">Ubon Ratchathani Province</a> of eastern Thailand on 1 June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began under the supervision of <a href="No.%205%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron</a> in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No. 79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (<a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a>) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long <a href="tour%20of%20duty">tours of duty</a> in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the <a href="Defence%20Committee%20%28Australia%29">Defence Committee</a>, the highest decision-making body of the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>, recommended to <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a> that No. 79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand on the grounds that the British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28 March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance, however.

Throughout its period at Ubon, No. 79 Squadron formed part of an international force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At the start of the deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No. 79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>-controlled <a href="Air%20America%20%28airline%29">Air America</a>. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.

From early April 1965, Ubon became an important base for <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and No. 79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25 June. This changed the status of the squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No. 79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF <a href="Airfield%20Defence%20Guards">airfield defence guards</a>. While the squadron did not play an active role in the war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-17">MiG-17</a> fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States <a href="Pacific%20Air%20Forces">Pacific Air Forces</a>, General <a href="Hunter%20Harris%2C%20Jr.">Hunter Harris, Jr.</a>, wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>, to suggest that No. 79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20trail">Ho Chi Minh trail</a> in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement. On 2 March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.

By mid-1968, No. 79 Squadron no longer had a clear role at Ubon. The USAF had sufficient fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters—which were now regarded as obsolete—to intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's <a href="rules%20of%20engagement">rules of engagement</a> did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No. 79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26 July and disbanded at the end of the month. On 31 March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968.

On 31 March 1986, No. 79 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Butterworth as a temporary measure to cover part of the period while the RAAF's three fighter squadrons were transitioning from <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Mirage III</a>s to <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornets</a>. The squadron inherited all of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron's</a> twelve Mirage III fighters and most of its personnel; the remainder of No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re-equipped with Hornets. As well as the Mirage IIIs, the squadron operated a single <a href="De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a> transport that was also based at Butterworth.

In its new incarnation, No. 79 Squadron continued the air defence and training duties for which No. 3 Squadron had been responsible at Butterworth. It participated in routine training exercises in Southeast Asia, which included making regular deployments to <a href="Paya%20Lebar%20Air%20Base">Paya Lebar Air Base</a> in Singapore to train with the <a href="Republic%20of%20Singapore%20Air%20Force">Republic of Singapore Air Force</a>. In May 1987 the squadron deployed to <a href="Clark%20Air%20Base">Clarke Air Force Base</a> in the Philippines to participate in the annual <a href="Red%20Flag%20%E2%80%93%20Alaska">Cope Thunder</a> exercise with USAF units. It also exercised with No. 77 Squadron's new F/A-18 Hornets in April 1988 when that unit visited Butterworth. The Caribou transport was used to support Australian Army units in Malaysia and also flew training sorties to neighbouring countries.

By early 1988 both No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons had successfully converted to the F/A-18, and No. 79 Squadron was no longer required. Preparations to return the unit's Mirages to Australia took place during the first months of 1988, and on 3 May they departed Butterworth. As the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet squadrons were to be based in Australia, this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth that had begun in mid-1958. No. 79 Squadron's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low-altitude flypast of the base, the first leg of which commenced at <a href="transonic%20speed">transonic speed</a>. The aircraft were flown to <a href="Woomera%2C%20South%20Australia">Woomera</a> in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar, <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, Darwin and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Base Tindal</a>. Most of No. 79 Squadron's ground crew returned to Australia in late May, and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30 June 1988.

No. 79 Squadron was re-formed a third time on 1 July 1998 as a training unit located at RAAF Base Pearce near <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> in Western Australia. The squadron was re-established by separating <a href="No.%2025%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 25 Squadron's</a> Permanent Air Force (full-time) component from its Air Force Reserve (part-time reservist) personnel and responsibilities. The squadron initially operated <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Aermacchi MB-326</a> aircraft before being re-equipped with Hawk 127 aircraft between 7 December 2000 and 4 March 2001. In 2000 No. 78 Wing was re-formed and assumed command of No. 76 and No. 79 Squadrons. The Hawks experienced serviceability problems during their first 18 months with the squadron, but these were eventually rectified. During October 2003 two No. 79 Squadron Hawks conducted a tour of Australia to belatedly commemorate the unit's 60th anniversary. During this tour the aircrew visited Alan Rawlinson at his home at <a href="Naracoorte%2C%20South%20Australia">Naracoorte, South Australia</a>, and later conducted a flyover of the town in his honour. The squadron made its first overseas deployment in almost twenty years during April 2006 when six Hawks and 52 personnel were dispatched to RMAF Base Butterworth to take part in <a href="Exercise%20Bersama%20Shield">Exercise Bersama Shield</a>. This was also the first time RAAF Hawks had operated overseas. As of May 2010, No. 79 Squadron was equipped with 15 of the RAAF's 33 Hawks. In 2011, the squadron was organised into a Training Flight, Operations Flight, and Maintenance Flight. A program to modernise all of the RAAF's Hawks to a similar standard to the Royal Air Force's Hawk T.2 aircraft began in 2014, and No. 79 Squadron is scheduled to begin operations with these aircraft in mid-2017. The unit's Maintenance Flight was disbanded in July 2016 when responsibility for support services for the Hawks was transferred to BAE Systems.

In its current role No. 79 Squadron's main responsibility is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Flying Training School</a>. During this training, new pilots who have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on jet aircraft combat tactics. In 2004, each of No. 79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks. After completing their initial jet aircraft training, pilots transfer to No. 76 Squadron at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a> for advanced instruction before being posted to one of the RAAF's <a href="operational%20conversion%20unit">operational conversion unit</a>s. No. 79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18F Super Hornets</a>. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">F-111</a> strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010. No. 79 Squadron also provides refresher training on the Hawk aircraft for experienced fighter pilots.

In addition to its pilot training responsibilities, No. 79 Squadron's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises. These duties are undertaken by experienced pilots who did not successfully complete operational conversion training, and also by new pilots who have completed training with No. 76 Squadron and been posted back to No. 79 Squadron until a place becomes available in an operational conversion course. No. 76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight. Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place off the coast of Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.

 Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 13 states that the detachment of Sabres was officially designated No. 79 Squadron on 24 June 1962.<br>

No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF

No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) is a fighter training unit of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a>, conducts refresher courses for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No. 2 OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron</a> and undertaking initial fighter combat instruction at <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a>. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No. 81 Wing's operational Hornet units, <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a> or <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a>.

The unit was established as No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) in April 1942 at <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, South Australia, and relocated to <a href="Mildura%20Airport">RAAF Station Mildura</a>, Victoria, the following month. During World War II, it provided training on a wide range of aircraft, including <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawks</a>, <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeances</a>, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s, <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s and <a href="Airspeed%20Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a>s. Disbanded in March 1947, No. 2 OTU was re-formed at Williamtown in March 1952 in response to the demand for more highly trained pilots to serve in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. It was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958, and since then has conducted training with the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>, <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a>, and <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326</a>, prior to taking delivery of the Hornet.

The role of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) is to "support the preparation for and the conduct of effective airspace control, counter air strike and combat air support operations through the provision of trained personnel". Located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, it comes under the control of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>, part of <a href="Air%20Combat%20Group%20RAAF">Air Combat Group</a>.

No. 2 OCU is primarily responsible for conducting operational conversion courses on the RAAF's <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> multi-role fighter, which entered service in 1985. The unit takes students who have converted to fast jets with <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron</a>, located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a>, Western Australia, and undergone lead-in fighter training at <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a>, based at Williamtown. Most are new to operational flying, but some are "retreads" (experienced pilots converting from another aircraft type). No. 2 OCU's instructors are among the RAAF's most experienced Hornet pilots, and often play a major role developing new tactics, in co-operation with fighter combat instructors at other No. 81 Wing units.

No. 2 OCU operates both single-seat F/A-18A Hornets and two-seat F/A-18Bs. The F/A-18B is largely identical to the A model aside from its dual cockpit, which reduces internal fuel capacity by about six per cent. Aircraft <a href="livery">livery</a> includes a yellow-and-black tail fin flash, the base featuring a yellow tiger's head outlined in black, with a red mouth, white fangs and white eyes. The unit crest shows a winged kangaroo carrying a <a href="Joey%20%28marsupial%29">joey</a> in its pouch, symbolising "'Mother Australia' flying with her young". The motto is "Juventus Non Sine Pinnis" ("The Young Shall Have Wings").

Hornet conversion courses run for six months, after which graduates are posted to one of the RAAF's front-line fighter units, <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> or <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a> at Williamtown, or <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Base Tindal</a>, Northern Territory. Students must first gain their instrument rating on the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics. The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, in 1986. The exercise lasts several weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s with practice and live bombs.

As well as operational conversion, No. 2 OCU conducts refresher courses and fighter combat instructor courses on the Hornet. Pilots who have not flown Hornets for more than nine months undertake the two-week refresher course. Fighter combat instructor courses run for five months and are given every two years. Students are chosen from among the most experienced Hornet squadron pilots and undergo instruction in how to train others, as well as how to deal with complex operational scenarios. This is tested in simulated combat with other types of US or RAAF aircraft, as available, including <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">F-15 Eagles</a>, <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcons</a>, and <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18 Super Hornets</a>. Graduates become qualified F/A-18 instructors and initially remain with No. 2 OCU for the next two-year cycle. After this time, they are posted to one of the front-line squadrons or No. 81 Wing's headquarters as Hornet weapons-and-tactics specialists. Along with training pilots, No. 2 OCU may be called upon to conduct operational tasks in "particular circumstances".

During World War II, the RAAF established several operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills they had already learned. No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) was formed on 2 April 1942 at <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffrey</a>, a <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> who had led No. 3 Squadron in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a>. Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, two of the first three fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced toward New Guinea. His team of instructors at No. 2 OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a>. Originally equipped with <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s and <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a>s, the unit's complement was augmented by <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawks</a>, <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeances</a>, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s, <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s and <a href="Airspeed%20Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a>s after it relocated to <a href="Mildura%20Airport">RAAF Station Mildura</a>, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time. During November, No. 2 OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire Mk V against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.

No. 2 OTU's Spitfire section was transferred to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, in March 1943, under the command of ace <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Waddy">John Waddy</a>. Jeffrey handed over command of No. 2 OTU at Mildura in August 1943; the same month, the unit logged over 5,000 flying hours, its highest level during the war. For the remainder of the conflict it maintained an average strength of more than 100 aircraft. North African campaign aces and former No. 3 Squadron commanders <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a> and <a href="Nicky%20Barr">Nicky Barr</a> served successively as chief flying instructor from March 1944 until the end of the Pacific War. Group Captain Arthur led the unit from July to November 1944, when Group Captain Jeffrey resumed command. During 1945, the Spitfires and Kittyhawks were replaced by 32 <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s. Training concluded that October, following the cessation of hostilities, and No. 2 OTU was reduced to a care-and-maintenance unit. During the war, it had graduated 1,247 pilots, losing 45 students in fatal accidents. Jeffrey completed his appointment in June 1946, and the unit was disbanded on 25 March 1947.

Post-war <a href="demobilization">demobilisation</a> saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's OTUs. Operational conversion of new pilots then became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and the introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal system of operational training. According to <a href="Dick%20Cresswell">Dick Cresswell</a>, commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron in Korea from September 1950 to August 1951:

The RAAF moved to rectify the situation by re-forming No. 2 OTU on 1 March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jets. Cresswell took command of No. 2 OTU on 21 May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> jet fighter to No. 2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The <a href="flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, in concert with the <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a> (ARDU). On 3 December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No. 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No. 77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%28R71%29">HMAS "Vengeance"</a>. Training courses on the Sabre began on 1 January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No. 3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No. 2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.

In May 1958, <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Applied Flying Training School</a> began equipping with Vampire jet trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia. As RAAF pilots were now gaining their first exposure to jets elsewhere, No. 2 OTU took over from the fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres. Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month. Wing Commander <a href="Neville%20McNamara">Neville McNamara</a>, later <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) and <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force Staff</a>, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961. During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No. 75 Squadron at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Bases Amberley</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Townsville</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">Darwin</a>. Two Sabre pilots from No. 2 OCU and one from No. 75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's <a href="Aircraft%20canopy">canopy</a> during the ejection sequence. All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to shatter the canopy immediately before the pilot ejected.

Along with Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, also based at Williamtown, No. 2 OCU was under the control of No. 81 Wing from 1961 until the wing was disbanded in 1966. By late 1963, personnel were busy developing training material for the pending Sabre replacement, the <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a>, a task that required them to translate the manufacturer's technical documentation from the original French. No. 2 OCU received its first Mirages in February and March 1964. It commenced conversion courses on the type that October, and fighter combat instructor courses in August 1968. The RAAF eventually took delivery of 100 Mirage IIIO single-seat fighters and 16 Mirage IIID two-seat trainers; No. 2 OCU operated both models. Squadron Leader <a href="John%20Newham">John Newham</a>, later to serve as CAS, held temporary command of the unit from July 1965 to April 1966. A Sabre-equipped <a href="Aerobatics">aerobatic</a> display team named the "Marksmen" was formed within No. 2 OCU during 1966 and 1967. Between 1967 and 1984, six of the unit's Mirages suffered major accidents, resulting in three fatalities. Experience in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> led the RAAF to begin training <a href="Forward%20air%20control">Forward air control</a>lers in 1968. The task initially fell to No. 2 OCU before a specialised unit, <a href="No.%204%20Forward%20Air%20Control%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight</a>, was formed in 1970. In October 1969, the OCU began operating the <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326</a> jet for lead-in fighter training, as well as the Mirage. <a href="No.%205%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 5 Operational Training Unit</a>, based at Williamtown, took over responsibility for Macchi courses from April 1970 until its disbandment in July the following year; the Macchis were then transferred back to No. 2 OCU.
In preparation for the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, No. 2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1 January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No. 77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. Beginning on 17 May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No. 2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19 August with four F/A-18Bs and three students. No. 2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos. 3, 75 and 77. The first year of Hornet service saw No. 2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country to unveil the new fighter to the Australian public. All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No. 81 Wing on 2 February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No. 2 OCU; this role was taken over by No. 76 Squadron in January 1989. No. 2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at <a href="Great%20Palm%20Island">Great Palm Island</a>, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18 November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base. The unit temporarily relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.

The RAAF began modifying four of its <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> jet transports to enable <a href="Aerial%20refueling">air-to-air refuelling</a> of the Hornets in December 1988; No. 2 OCU staff commenced training for airborne tanker operations in July 1991, subsequently adding this capability to the Hornet conversion course. By the mid-1990s, the unit had 12 instructors and a complement of 18 Hornets, including 13 two-seaters. It was running two conversion courses per year, with eight students per course, and had an average failure rate of 10 per cent. Several of its instructors were US and Canadian pilots on exchange with the RAAF. In 2000, No. 2 OCU joined Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons as part of <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a>, which had been re-established as an operational training formation. As of 2005, the unit had a strength of between 12 and 14 instructors and ran three Hornet conversion courses and one fighter combat instructor course over two-year cycles. About six new Hornet pilots took part in each of the conversion courses, and the unit generally graduated 15 new Hornet pilots over each cycle. By 2007, No. 2 OCU had returned to the aegis of No. 81 Wing, under Air Combat Group. Although the duration of the conversion courses has remained unchanged since the Hornets were introduced into service, the content covered has been altered over time to reflect upgrades to the Hornets, the replacement of the Macchis with <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Hawk">BAE Hawk 127</a> trainers in the early 2000s, and experience gained from using Hornets in combat during the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. No. 2 OCU conducted its 32nd fighter combat instructor course in 2013. The graduation exercise, Aces North, was the first to involve RAAF F/A-18 Super Hornets, <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30</a> tankers, and <a href="Boeing%20737%20AEW%26amp%3BC">Boeing E-7 Wedgetail</a> early warning aircraft, as well as the "Classic" Hornets. The unit was awarded the 2016 <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> for proficiency. In December 2017, Australia's first female fighter pilots graduated from No. 2 OCU.

SMS "Nassau" was the first <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> built for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>, a response to the launching of the British battleship . "Nassau" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 22 July 1907 at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Kaiserliche Werft</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, and <a href="ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> less than a year later on 7 March 1908, approximately 25 months after "Dreadnought". She was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Nassau-class%20battleship">her class</a> of four battleships, which included , , and .

"Nassau" saw service in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, in the II Division of the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a> of the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. In August 1915, she entered the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>, where she engaged the Russian battleship . Following her return to the North Sea, "Nassau" and her sister ships took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June 1916. During the battle, "Nassau" collided with the British destroyer . "Nassau" suffered a total of 11 killed and 16 injured during the engagement.

After World War I, the bulk of the High Seas Fleet was interned in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the "Nassau"-class ships were for the time permitted to remain in German ports. After the <a href="scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">German fleet was scuttled</a>, "Nassau" and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> as replacements for the sunken ships. "Nassau" was ceded to <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> her in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

"Nassau" was long, wide, and had a draft of . She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> with a normal load, and fully laden. The ship had a crew of 40 officers and 968 enlisted men. "Nassau" retained three-shafted <a href="Steam%20engine%23Multiple%20expansion%20engines">triple expansion engines</a> with coal-fired boilers instead of more advanced <a href="turbine">turbine</a> engines. Her propulsion system was rated at and provided a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . This type of machinery was chosen at the request of both Admiral <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> and the Navy's construction department; the latter stated in 1905 that the "use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself." This decision was based solely on cost: at the time, <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million <a href="German%20gold%20mark">gold mark</a> royalty fee for every turbine engine made. German firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910.

"Nassau" carried twelve <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20gun">SK L/45</a> guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">SK L/45 guns</a> and sixteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45 guns</a>, all of which were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. The ship was also armed with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s. One tube was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each broadside, on either ends of the <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick in the central portion of the hull, and the armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick sides, and the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected with of armor plating.

"Nassau" was ordered under the provisional name "Ersatz Bayern", as a replacement for the old . She was laid down on 22 July 1907 at the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Kaiserliche Werft</a>" in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, under construction number 30. Construction work proceeded under absolute secrecy; detachments of soldiers were tasked with guarding the shipyard itself, as well as contractors that supplied building materials, such as <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>. The ship was launched on 7 March 1908; she was christened by <a href="Princess%20Hilda%20of%20Nassau">Princess Hilda of Nassau</a>, and the ceremony was attended by Kaiser <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a> and <a href="Duke%20Henry%20of%20Mecklenburg-Schwerin">Prince Henry of the Netherlands</a>, representing his wife's <a href="House%20of%20Orange-Nassau">House of Orange-Nassau</a>.

<a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a> work was delayed significantly when a dockyard worker accidentally removed a blanking plate from a large pipe, which allowed a significant amount of water to flood the ship. The ship did not have its <a href="watertight%20bulkhead">watertight bulkhead</a>s installed, so the water spread throughout the ship and caused it to list to port and sink to the bottom of the dock. The ship had to be pumped dry and cleaned out, which proved to be a laborious task. The ship was completed by the end of September 1909. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 October 1909, and <a href="sea%20trial">trials</a> commenced immediately. , the ship that spurred "Nassau"s construction, had been launched 25 months before "Nassau", on 2 February 1906. The ship cost the German navy 37,399,000 gold marks.
On 16 October 1909, "Nassau" and her sister participated in a ceremony for the opening of the new third entrance in the Wilhelmshaven Naval Dockyard. They took part in the annual maneuvers of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> in February 1910 while still on trials. "Nassau" finished her trials on 3 May and joined the newly created <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a> of the High Seas Fleet. Over the next four years, the ship participated in the regular series of squadron and fleet maneuvers and training cruises. The one exception was the summer training cruise for 1912 when, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the cruise only went into the Baltic. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. The threat of war caused Kaiser Wilhelm II to cancel the cruise after two weeks, and by the end of July the fleet was back in port. War between <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a> broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.

"Nassau" participated in most of the fleet advances into the North Sea throughout the war. The first operation was conducted primarily by Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s; the ships bombarded the English coastal towns of <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. A German battlefleet of 12 dreadnoughts—including "Nassau"—and eight <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnoughts</a> sailed in support of the battlecruisers. On the evening of 15 December, they came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes in the darkness between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens convinced the German fleet commander, Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, that the entire <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> was deployed before him. Under orders from the Kaiser to not risk the fleet, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany.

In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> to facilitate the capture of <a href="Riga">Riga</a> by the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a>. To do so, the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, which included the pre-dreadnought battleship and a number of gunboats and destroyers. The German naval force would also lay a series of <a href="naval%20mine">minefields</a> in the northern entrance to the gulf to prevent Russian naval reinforcements from being able to enter the area. The fleet that assembled for the assault included "Nassau" and her three sister ships, the four s, and the battlecruisers , , and . The force would operate under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper. The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla. The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful, as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer to lay a minefield of her own.

On 16 August 1915, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf: "Nassau" and "Posen", four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats managed to breach the Russian defenses. On the first day of the assault, the German <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a> "T 46" was sunk, as was the destroyer "V 99". The following day, "Nassau" and "Posen" engaged in an artillery duel with "Slava", resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that forced her to retreat. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf. Reports of Allied <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s in the area prompted the Germans to call off of the operation the following day. "Nassau" and "Posen" remained in the Gulf until 21 August, and while there assisted in the destruction of the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s and . Admiral Hipper later remarked that,

"To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active, with the corresponding risk of damage and loss, was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf "before" the capture of Riga from the land side."
"Nassau" took part in the inconclusive Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, in the II Division of the I Battle Squadron. For the majority of the battle, the I Battle Squadron formed the center of the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, behind Rear Admiral Behncke's III Battle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron. "Nassau" was the third ship in the group of four, behind "Rheinland" and ahead of "Westfalen"; "Posen" was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so "Nassau" was the second ship in the line, astern of "Westfalen".

Between 17:48 and 17:52, eleven German dreadnoughts, including "Nassau", engaged and opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; "Nassau"s target was the cruiser . "Nassau" is believed to have scored one hit on "Southampton", at approximately 17:50 at a range of , shortly after she began firing. The shell struck "Southampton" obliquely on her port side, and did not cause significant damage. "Nassau" then shifted her guns to the cruiser ; firing ceased by 18:10. At 19:33, "Nassau" came into range of the British battleship ; her main guns fired briefly, but after the 180 degree turn by the German fleet, the British ship was no longer within reach.

"Nassau" and the rest of the I Squadron were again engaged by British light forces shortly after 22:00, including the light cruisers , , and . "Nassau" followed her sister "Westfalen" in a 68° turn to starboard in order to evade any <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es that might have been fired. The two ships fired on "Caroline" and "Royalist" at a range of around . The British ships turned away briefly, before turning about to launch torpedoes. "Caroline" fired two at "Nassau"; the first passed close to her bows and the second passed under the ship without exploding.
At around midnight on 1 June, the German fleet was attempting to pass behind the British Grand Fleet when it encountered a line of British destroyers. "Nassau" came upon the destroyer , and in the confusion, attempted to ram her. "Spitfire" tried to evade, but could not maneuver away fast enough, and the two ships collided. "Nassau" fired her forward 11-inch guns at the destroyer. They could not depress low enough for "Nassau" to be able to score a hit; nonetheless, the blast from the guns destroyed "Spitfire"s <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. At that point, "Spitfire" was able to disengage from "Nassau", and took with her a 6 m (20 ft) portion of "Nassau"s side plating. The collision disabled one of "Nassau"s 15 cm (5.9 in) guns, and left a 3.5 m (11.5 ft) gash above the waterline; this slowed the ship to until it could be repaired. During the confused action, "Nassau" was hit by two shells from the British destroyers, which damaged her searchlights and inflicted minor casualties.

Shortly after 01:00, "Nassau" and encountered the British armored cruiser . "Thüringen" opened fire first, and pummeled "Black Prince" with a total of 27 heavy-caliber shells and 24 shells from her secondary battery. "Nassau" and joined in, followed by . The heavy fire quickly disabled the British cruiser and set her alight; following a tremendous explosion, she sank, taking her entire crew with her. The sinking "Black Prince" was directly in the path of "Nassau"; to avoid the wreck, the ship had to steer sharply towards the III Battle Squadron. It was necessary for "Nassau" to reverse her engines to full speed astern to avoid a collision with . "Nassau" then fell back into a position between the pre-dreadnoughts and . At around 03:00, several British destroyers attempted another torpedo attack on the German line. At approximately 03:10, three or four destroyers appeared in the darkness to port of "Nassau"; at a range of between to , "Nassau" briefly fired on the ships before turning away 90° to avoid torpedoes.

Following her return to German waters, "Nassau", her sisters "Posen" and "Westfalen", and the "Helgoland"-class battleships and "Thüringen", took up defensive positions in the <a href="Jadebusen">Jade</a> <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> for the night. In the course of the battle, "Nassau" was hit twice by secondary shells, though these hits caused no significant damage. Her casualties amounted to 11 men killed and 16 men wounded. During the course of the battle, she fired 106 main battery shells and 75 rounds from her secondary guns. Repairs were completed quickly, and "Nassau" was back with the fleet by 10 July 1916.

<a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Another fleet advance</a> followed on 18–22 August, during which the I Scouting Group battlecruisers were to bombard the coastal town of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. As only two of the four German battlecruisers were still in fighting condition, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the Scouting Group for the operation: , , and the newly commissioned . The High Seas Fleet, including "Nassau", would trail behind and provide cover. At 06:00 on 19 August, "Westfalen" was torpedoed by the British submarine north of <a href="Terschelling">Terschelling</a>; the ship remained afloat and was detached to return to port. The British were aware of the German plans and <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

Another sortie into the North Sea followed on 19–20 October. On 21 December, "Nassau" ran aground in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser "Moltke" suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. "Nassau", "Ostfriesland", and "Thüringen" were formed into a special unit for Operation "Schlußstein", a planned occupation of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. On 8 August, "Nassau" took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.

"Nassau" and her three sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Großadmiral") of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. Many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on "Thüringen" and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.

Following the German collapse in November 1918, a significant portion of the High Seas Fleet was interned in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. "Nassau" and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained at German ports. During this period, from November to December, <a href="Hermann%20Bauer">Hermann Bauer</a> served as the ship's commander. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, under the mistaken impression that the Armistice would expire at noon that day, <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered his ships be scuttled</a> to prevent their seizure by the British. As a result, the four "Nassau"-class ships were ceded to the various Allied powers as replacements for the ships that had been sunk. "Nassau" was awarded to Japan on 7 April 1920, though the Japanese had no need for the ship. They, therefore, sold her in June 1920 to British shipbreakers, who scrapped the ship in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a>.

Capcom Five

The Capcom Five are five <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s that were unveiled by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> in late 2002 and published from March 2003. At a time when <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">console</a> had failed to capture <a href="market%20share">market share</a>, Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off <a href="video%20game%20development%20party">third-party developer</a> support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be <a href="console%20exclusivity">exclusive</a> to the GameCube. The five games were "<a href="P.N.03">P.N.03</a>", a futuristic <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a>; "<a href="Viewtiful%20Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>", a <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="action%20game">action</a>-<a href="platform%20game">platformer</a>; "Dead Phoenix", a <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a>; "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>", a <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> third-person shooter; and "<a href="Killer7">Killer7</a>", an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> with <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" director <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a> and, except "Killer7", developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only "Resident Evil 4" was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.

Of the five games, "Dead Phoenix" was canceled and only "P.N.03" retained its status as a GameCube exclusive. It was a critical and commercial failure. Both "Viewtiful Joe" and "Killer7" sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. "Killer7" gained a significant <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>, effectively launching the career of director <a href="Goichi%20Suda">Suda51</a>. "Resident Evil 4" was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> <a href="porting">port</a> to be released later in 2005. "Viewtiful Joe" also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and "Killer7" debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for "Resident Evil 4", as a major blow to Nintendo–Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.

During the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES) and <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a> (SNES) eras, <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> enjoyed a close relationship, with "<a href="Mega%20Man">Mega Man</a>" as one of the NES' most prominent franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> of the <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a> market, which allowed the company to compel <a href="video%20game%20development%20party">third-party developers</a> to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. <a href="Sega">Sega</a>'s rival <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties—Capcom included—moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>". On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or <a href="overstock">overstock</a>ing inventory which might eat into revenue. This third-party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation.
With the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, Nintendo tried to reclaim third-party developers and catch up to Sony's <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> by featuring disc-based media and powerful system hardware. However, in the first year after its launch, Nintendo sold 4.7 million consoles. In this climate of flagging sales, Capcom held a surprise press conference in Japan in November 2002, announcing five new titles for the GameCube: "P.N.03", "Viewtiful Joe", "Dead Phoenix", "Resident Evil 4", and "Killer7". The games would be developed in-house by Capcom's Production with "Resident Evil" 1 director <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a> as supervisor. The lone exception was "Killer7", to be produced at <a href="Grasshopper%20Manufacture">Grasshopper Manufacture</a>, with Mikami as co-writer alongside director <a href="Goichi%20Suda">Suda51</a>. When pressed for comment on <a href="console%20exclusivity">console exclusivity</a>, a Capcom USA representative confirmed the claim, generating the perception that Capcom was hoping to boost the GameCube's sales and reputation. A statement on their website echoed this support for GameCube. However, Capcom USA soon rescinded their confirmation, blaming it on a miscommunication with the parent company. They clarified that only "Resident Evil 4" would definitely be exclusive.

"<a href="P.N.03">P.N.03</a>" is a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>-themed <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a>, released in Japan on March 27, 2003. The game features a dexterous protagonist named Vanessa Z. Schneider who battles an army of maverick robots. The game earned the name "Jaguar" during development due to Vanessa's fluid motions and agility. Acting as director, Mikami attempted to differentiate it from "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry">Devil May Cry</a>" by adding defensive and evasive maneuvers. This desire, combined with the limited development time, also led to the replacement of Vanessa's guns with energy bolts. Upon its release, reviewers criticized the game's short length and sluggish controls, with an average score of 63 out of 100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Mikami was unsatisfied with the finished product, stating he had hoped to put "a lot more" time into its development. "P.N.03" was the only game of the five that remained a GameCube exclusive.

"<a href="Viewtiful%20Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>" is a <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="action%20game">action</a>-<a href="platform%20game">platformer</a>, released on June 26, 2003. The <a href="title%20role">title character</a> is a parody of <a href="tokusatsu">tokusatsu</a> superheroes and is trying to save his girlfriend, who has been trapped in "Movieland" by a group of supervillains known as Jadow. To complete his quest, Joe must use his Viewtiful Effects Powers, which are based on camera tricks and special effects used in films. These include "Slow", which simulates <a href="bullet%20time">bullet time</a>; "Mach Speed", allowing Joe to attack all enemies with his afterimages; and "Zoom In", which triggers a camera <a href="close-up">close-up</a> and unlocks special attacks. Internally, Capcom treated the game as a "staff-focused project" with the goal of increasing the skills of director <a href="Hideki%20Kamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a>. The game achieved a Metacritic score of 93 and won GameCube <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> awards from numerous publications including <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, "<a href="GMR%20%28magazine%29">GMR</a>", and "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>". The game sold out its initial shipment of 100,000 to achieve a lifetime total of 275,000 units. Producer <a href="Atsushi%20Inaba">Atsushi Inaba</a> considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well. However, these numbers were lower than Capcom expected, prompting the publisher to <a href="porting">port</a> "Viewtiful Joe" to PlayStation 2 in 2004, with expanded features. This version sold 46,000 copies with a slightly lower Metacritic score of 90 owing to the lack of <a href="progressive%20scan">progressive scan</a> and <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> slowdown generated by the porting process.

"Dead Phoenix" was going to be a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> featuring a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to "<a href="Panzer%20Dragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a>". Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical <a href="floating%20city%20%28science%20fiction%29">floating city</a>, full of monsters and dragons. "Game Informer" announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new "<a href="Kid%20Icarus">Kid Icarus</a>" title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.

"<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>", a <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> third-person shooter, had its North American premiere on January 11, 2005, and its Japanese release on January 27. Players take on the role of <a href="Leon%20S.%20Kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a> agent who has been ordered to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States from a cult in rural <a href="hispanophone">hispanophone</a> Europe. The cult has been using a <a href="mind%20control">mind-controlling</a> <a href="parasite">parasite</a> to turn local villagers into violent drones. The game went through numerous changes during its long development—the team created and discarded four prototypes before settling on the final product. Among these was a version directed by Hideki Kamiya that would be turned into the first "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry%20%28video%20game%29">Devil May Cry</a>" game. Taking over directorial duties, Mikami made the fifth and final version very different compared to previous "Resident Evil" games, with an over-the-shoulder perspective and an increased emphasis on action and combat. "Resident Evil 4" was the only game of the five to remain confirmed as a GameCube exclusive; Mikami claimed that he would "cut his own head off" (a Japanese <a href="colloquialism">colloquialism</a> for quitting his job) if it were to be released on another platform. However, just two months before the game's January 2005 release, Capcom revealed that a PlayStation 2 port would be published nine months after the GameCube version in response to pressure from users and shareholders. This surprise announcement undercut the title's GameCube sales, which totaled 1.6 million, compared to the sales of the PlayStation 2 version, which exceeded 2 million. Mikami apologized to GameCube fans for failing to uphold his promise of console exclusivity. Despite these corporate conflicts, the game received an overwhelmingly positive critical response with Metacritic scores of 96 for both versions. It went on to sweep many Game of the Year awards for 2005 and is consistently listed among the greatest games of all time.

"<a href="Killer7">Killer7</a>", released on June 9, 2005, is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> with <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> elements and an unconventional "on rails" control scheme. Unlike other members of the five, "Killer7" was developed at Grasshopper Manufacture under the direction of Suda51. Players control the members of an elite group of assassins who are actually physical manifestations of a god-like being named Harman Smith. The game restricts the player's movement to specific branching paths through the environment and combat is only available while stationary in first-person view. This stripped-down control scheme was implemented as a <a href="deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of conventional control mechanics. Gameplay was not finalized until late in development as Suda51 concentrated most resources on story and visual work. This back-loading of development resulted in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7) in North America. "Killer7" debuted as a multi-console release, the only one of the five to do so, to polarized reviews. Some reviewers praised the game for its complex <a href="film%20noir">noir</a> plot involving a political conflict between Japan and the US, while others panned it as confusing and incomprehensible. Similarly, the control scheme had both critics and proponents, the latter comparing it to "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>", "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>", and other "old-school" <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>s. Although it received a lukewarm 74 Metacritic score, "Killer7" was honored by many <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game publications</a> in their year-end awards. Common nominations included "Best Story", "Best Artistic Design", and "Most Innovative Design". However, the central theme was a recognition of "Killer7"'s status as a <a href="cult%20following">cult game</a> with limited appeal. IGN named it "Best Game No One Played" and Kristan Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> called it "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an <a href="everyman">everyman</a>'s game".

The Capcom Five announcement came at a time when Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was "P.N.03" and not "Resident Evil 4", as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's <a href="console%20wars">console wars</a>. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of the attitudes of third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform.

Capcom discovered a few business principles through their experience with development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>103 million for <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. "Resident Evil 4" was a case in point, beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions by the time of its 2005 release. The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; "Resident Evil 4" was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, "<a href="Viewtiful%20Joe%202">Viewtiful Joe 2</a>" started development shortly after the release of "Viewtiful Joe" and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative gameplay</a> mode. "Viewtiful Joe 2" debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.
To facilitate "Viewtiful Joe 2"s development, Capcom turned "Team Viewtiful" into <a href="Clover%20Studio">Clover Studio</a>, a semi-autonomous production company with a focus on developing new <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual properties</a> (IPs). The separation was also in part due to "Resident Evil 4"s PlayStation 2 release, which caused significant tensions between Capcom and Mikami, who had touted the game's console exclusivity. However, the studio only produced two new IPs before Capcom closed it in late 2006, following the resignations of Atsushi Inaba, Hideki Kamiya, and Shinji Mikami. These resignations were part of a series of high-profile departures from Capcom, including <a href="Yoshiki%20Okamoto">Yoshiki Okamoto</a> in 2003 and <a href="Keiji%20Inafune">Keiji Inafune</a> in 2010. The former Clover developers charged that Capcom's corporate management was reluctant or actively opposed to risky new ideas, a complaint shared by Inafune. They would go on to found <a href="PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a> with members of their old studio. In 2008, they announced the "Platinum Three", referring to "<a href="MadWorld">MadWorld</a>", "<a href="Infinite%20Space">Infinite Space</a>", and "<a href="Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>", which would attempt to carry on the Capcom Five's ambitious and creative original spirit.

Outside of Capcom, "Killer7" served as a turning point for Suda51 and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, effectively launching his career. With Capcom as publisher, "Killer7" was his first game to be released outside Japan. While its sales were not up to Capcom's standards, the game's cult success encouraged the director to remake two of his older Japan-only games, "<a href="The%20Silver%20Case">The Silver Case</a>" and "<a href="Flower%2C%20Sun%2C%20and%20Rain">Flower, Sun, and Rain</a>", for Western release. It also allowed his next major title, "<a href="No%20More%20Heroes%20%28video%20game%29">No More Heroes</a>", to be released to critical and commercial success. The game also cemented Suda51's status as an <a href="auteur%20theory">auteur</a> video game director. He would later work with Shinji Mikami again on "<a href="Shadows%20of%20the%20Damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>".

Despite the relative failure of the project as a whole, the individual games of the Capcom Five had a lasting impact on game design. After experimenting with action gameplay in "P.N.03", Mikami was able to apply his experience to "<a href="Vanquish%20%28video%20game%29">Vanquish</a>", which serves as an evolution and refinement of the former's gameplay. On the other hand, Adam Sorice of Nintendojo suggested that the commercial failure of such a women-driven game made Capcom reluctant to feature female leads in future games for a number of years. Beyond its critical success, "Resident Evil 4" became one of the most influential games of the decade. Its "over-the-shoulder" perspective has inspired third-person shooters and action games as diverse as "<a href="Gears%20of%20War">Gears of War</a>" and "". Leon's precision-aiming laser sight has also found its way into "<a href="Dead%20Space%20%28series%29">Dead Space</a>" and "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>", as an alternative to "lock-on" targeting. On a broader scale, "Resident Evil 4" deconstructed the survival horror conventions the first "Resident Evil" games established. Some reviewers accused the game of abandoning the genre's essence by adopting an increased emphasis on action and combat. Following "Resident Evil 4"s lead, many "horror" games in the next few years would shift toward more combat-heavy gameplay, including "" and "<a href="Alone%20in%20the%20Dark%20%282008%20video%20game%29">Alone in the Dark</a>".

According to <a href="source%20%28journalism%29">industry sources</a>, Capcom's reversal on GameCube exclusivity, particularly with "Resident Evil 4", was a betrayal that soured relations between Capcom and Nintendo for several years. After this early pulling of Capcom support, the GameCube went on to sell 22 million units, less than the Nintendo 64's 33 million units and only a fraction of the PlayStation 2's 155 million units. Though "Resident Evil 4" was eventually ported to Nintendo's <a href="Wii">Wii</a> in 2007, it also received a <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> <a href="high-definition%20remasters%20for%20PlayStation%20consoles">re-release</a> for <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> in 2011. The 2002 GameCube remake of "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%282002%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>" and "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20Zero">Resident Evil Zero</a>" also received remasters for newer consoles in 2015 and 2016 respectively. "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>" was released in 2008, featuring third party characters like <a href="Solid%20Snake">Solid Snake</a> from <a href="Konami">Konami</a> and <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> from <a href="Sega">Sega</a> as a selling point. <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> reported on a rumor that Nintendo refused to include a character from Capcom as a direct result of "Resident Evil 4"s multi-platform release. Years later, Capcom's own <a href="Mega%20Man%20%28character%29">Mega Man</a> appeared as a playable character in the next game in the series, "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20for%20Nintendo%203DS%20and%20Wii%20U">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a>".

Ultimately, the GameCube failed to reinvigorate flagging support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successor, the Wii. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development could not keep up with demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift toward more aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii would go on to become one of the most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> and <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, Nintendo has attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it enjoyed in the NES and SNES eras, though its success in this regard has been mixed.

Touch Me I'm Sick

"Touch Me I'm Sick" is a song by the American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a>. It was recorded in March 1988 at Seattle's <a href="Reciprocal%20Recording">Reciprocal Recording</a> studio with producer <a href="Jack%20Endino">Jack Endino</a>. "Touch Me I'm Sick" was released as Mudhoney's debut single by <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent record label</a> <a href="Sub%20Pop">Sub Pop</a> on August 1, 1988. The song's lyrics, which feature dark humor, are a sarcastic take on issues such as disease and violent sex.

When it was first released, "Touch Me I'm Sick" was a hit on the <a href="independent%20music">indie</a> circuit; it remains the band's most recognizable song. The heavily <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> and fuzzy guitars, snarling vocals, blunt bass line and energetic drumming contributed to a dirty sound that influenced many local musicians, and helped develop the nascent Seattle <a href="grunge">grunge</a> scene. According to <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, "the song's raw, primal energy made it an instant anthem which still stands as one of [grunge's] all-time classics".

According to Mudhoney vocalist <a href="Mark%20Arm">Mark Arm</a>, "Touch Me I'm Sick" originated from a discussion with <a href="Sub%20Pop">Sub Pop</a> owner <a href="Bruce%20Pavitt">Bruce Pavitt</a>, who "said: 'Hey, you sing about dogs. You sing about being sick. You got a shtick, it'll take you to the top.' And he basically gave us five chords, but he said don't use more than three within one song." Arm also states that "Touch Me I'm Sick" was a catchphrase around which the band built a song.

Mudhoney recorded the song at Seattle's <a href="Reciprocal%20Recording">Reciprocal Recording</a> studio in March 1988, three months after the band's formation. Producer <a href="Jack%20Endino">Jack Endino</a> was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; "for the most part, I just sort of stood back and let them go at it". Guitarist <a href="Steve%20Turner%20%28guitarist%29">Steve Turner</a> said that the band selected two of their "grungiest" songs for the single. "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" was to be the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">A-side</a> of the single and "Touch Me I'm Sick" the B-side before, in drummer <a href="Dan%20Peters">Dan Peters</a>'s words, "that all got flipped around".

"Touch Me I'm Sick" has a straightforward <a href="Garage%20punk%20%28fusion%20genre%29">garage punk</a> structure with a simple repeating <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a> <a href="riff">riff</a> played at a high <a href="tempo">tempo</a>. This is accompanied by a blunt bass line and frenetic drumming. The song's dirty sound was produced using an Electro-Harmonix <a href="Big%20Muff">Big Muff</a> <a href="Effects%20pedal">distortion pedal</a>, which is augmented by a second guitar providing more <a href="Distortion%20%28guitar%29">distortion</a>. Music writer Brian J. Barr referred to this noisy sound as "the sonic equivalent of an amplified comb scraping against paper".

Critics have noted a <a href="The%20Stooges">Stooges</a> influence in "Touch Me I'm Sick", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: "In retrospect, it's <a href="The%20Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by way of The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. At the time I was trying for the stuttering <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> guitar of The Nights and Days." The song is also reminiscent of the <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> of <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a>. In his book "Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story", Clark Humphrey accuses the song of being a copy of "The Witch" by <a href="The%20Sonics">The Sonics</a>. The band have dismissed this claim, and questioned the writer's knowledge of music.

Arm's lyrics, according to critic Steve Huey, are a rant about "disease, self-loathing, angst, and dirty sex". In an essay called "'Touch Me I'm Sick': Contagion as Critique in Punk and Performance Art", Catherine J. Creswell suggests that some of the lyrics refer to AIDS. According to Creswell, "In declaring 'Well, I'm diseased and I don't mind' and changing the final refrain to 'Fuck Me, I'm Sick!' the speaker declares himself to be the viral, 'AIDS-bearing,' 'polluting' person of contemporary fantasy". Creswell, who also believes the song parodies the theme of seduction in contemporary rock music, points to lyrics that refer to impotence ("If you don't come, if you don't come, if you don't come, you'll die alone!") and violent possession or forcing ("I'll make you love me till the day you die!"). However, Arm says that he had not put much thought into the lyrics; while performing the song in concerts, he sometimes changes them to amuse himself.

Another feature of "Touch Me I'm Sick" that has been commented upon is Arm's vocals. Huey refers to them as a "hysterical screech", and "snarling, demonic howls". Journalist Joe Ehrbar says that Arm begins the song with a "burp", before singing with a "nasally howl". Creswell considers Arm's "overboard" vocals to mock a variety of rock stereotypes: the punk snarl, the "woozy slur" of <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="garage%20rock">garage rock</a> "yea-ahs", R&B-style wails and a "<a href="Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> shudder".

"Touch Me I'm Sick" was released on August 1, 1988, as a <a href="7%26quot%3B%20vinyl">7" vinyl</a>. It was Mudhoney's debut release. Initially, <a href="Sub%20Pop">Sub Pop</a> released 800 clear coffee-brown vinyl copies, 200 black vinyl copies and a few assorted vinyl color copies of the single. The limited release numbers were inspired by another <a href="independent%20music">indie</a> label, <a href="Amphetamine%20Reptile">Amphetamine Reptile</a>. Sub Pop owners <a href="Bruce%20Pavitt">Bruce Pavitt</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Poneman">Jonathan Poneman</a> reasoned the limited supply would increase demand, and utilized different colors of vinyl in order to rationalize further limited pressings and to increase the single's allure as a collectible item. The record, which came in a white paper bag without a picture sleeve, had an inscription on the A-side: "What does the word 'crack' mean to you?". The B-side sticker featured the toilet picture that later became the cover art of the sleeved second edition of the single.

According to Pavitt, "It was just a limited edition, maybe 800 pieces, but people all over America started raving about it. People that we really respected."
The single was an indie hit in Seattle, and "Touch Me I'm Sick" became Mudhoney's most recognizable song. When asked in an interview about the sales figures of the single, Turner replied, "The first [pressing sold] 1,000, then 3,000 of the reissue, then it was out of print for a while; then they made 2,000 more and those are probably gone." The single's success caught the band by surprise; Arm had initially dismissed the song as a "B-side toss off". "Touch Me I'm Sick" and B-side "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" were later included on the Mudhoney compilation albums "<a href="Superfuzz%20Bigmuff%20Plus%20Early%20Singles">Superfuzz Bigmuff Plus Early Singles</a>" (1990) and "<a href="March%20to%20Fuzz">March to Fuzz</a>" (2000).

Prior to the release of the "Touch Me I'm Sick" single, Pavitt sent a five-song Mudhoney tape to New York <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> for the members' opinions. Sonic Youth immediately proposed a <a href="split%20album">split single</a> where each band <a href="cover%20version">covered</a> the other. Sonic Youth covered "Touch Me I'm Sick" while Mudhoney covered Sonic Youth's "Halloween". "<a href="Touch%20Me%20I%27m%20Sick/Halloween">Touch Me I'm Sick/Halloween</a>" was released as a limited edition 7" vinyl by Sub Pop in December 1988. The cover was included in the deluxe edition of "<a href="Daydream%20Nation">Daydream Nation</a>" (2007), and offers a female perspective of the song with bassist <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a> handling the vocals.

Following the success of the "Touch Me I'm Sick" single in the Seattle area, Sub Pop positioned Mudhoney as the flagship band of their roster and undertook heavy promotion for the group. The band's early material received airplay on <a href="college%20radio">college radio</a> and influenced many local musicians, including <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>. In a few years, many Seattle grunge bands signed to <a href="Record%20label%23Major%20labels">major labels</a> and broke into the mainstream, achieving mass popularity. Although Mudhoney never attained this level of mainstream acceptance, according to Allmusic's Mark Deming, the band's "indie-scene success laid the groundwork for the movement that would (briefly) make Seattle, WA, the new capital of the rock & roll universe".

Since its release, "Touch Me I'm Sick" has been accorded classic status within the grunge genre. Writing for Allmusic, Steve Huey described the song as "the ultimate grunge anthem" and "a crucial and vastly influential touchstone in the evolution of the grunge movement, virtually defining the term". For its northwestern rock exhibit, the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> requested the song's original lyrics sheet. Since it did not exist—Arm briefly considered making a fake one by writing down the lyrics, crumpling the sheet, and then burning the edges—the band instead donated Turner's old <a href="Big%20Muff">Big Muff</a> pedals.

"Touch Me I'm Sick" remains Mudhoney's most popular song. Joe Ehrbar called it "the song most of us would come to know [the band] by". Arm considers the track to be Mudhoney's highwater mark,
There's something special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't know if it was the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it had more to do with the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.

The song was referenced in the 1992 film "<a href="Singles%20%281992%20film%29">Singles</a>", which is set against the backdrop of the Seattle grunge scene. The fictional band in the film, Citizen Dick, perform a song called "Touch Me I'm Dick"—a wordplay on Mudhoney's song. In 2003, <a href="Charles%20Peterson%20%28photographer%29">Charles Peterson</a> published a book of photography titled "Touch Me I'm Sick". It features black-and-white photographs of bands (including Mudhoney) and concerts, and focuses on the alternative music scene of the 1980s and 1990s.

Both songs credited to <a href="Mark%20Arm">Mark Arm</a>, <a href="Steve%20Turner%20%28guitarist%29">Steve Turner</a>, <a href="Dan%20Peters">Dan Peters</a> and <a href="Matt%20Lukin">Matt Lukin</a>.

Siege of Constantinople (717–718)

The Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717–718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> against the capital city of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by <a href="Twenty%20Years%27%20Anarchy">prolonged internal turmoil</a>. In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by <a href="Maslama%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik</a>, invaded Byzantine <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III the Isaurian</a>, who had risen up against Emperor <a href="Theodosius%20III">Theodosius III</a>. Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself.

After wintering in the western coastlands of Asia Minor, the Arab army crossed into <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> in early summer 717 and built <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">siege lines</a> to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople%23Theodosian%20Walls">Theodosian Walls</a>. The Arab fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade by sea, was neutralized soon after its arrival by the <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine navy</a> through the use of <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea, while the Arab army was crippled by <a href="famine">famine</a> and <a href="disease">disease</a> during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgars</a> on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks.

The siege's failure had wide-ranging repercussions. The rescue of Constantinople ensured the continued survival of Byzantium, while the Caliphate's strategic outlook was altered: although regular attacks on Byzantine territories continued, the goal of outright conquest was abandoned. Historians consider the siege to be one of history's most important battles, as its failure postponed the Muslim advance into <a href="Southeastern%20Europe">Southeastern Europe</a> for centuries.

Following the <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28674%E2%80%93678%29">first Arab siege of Constantinople</a> (674–678), the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> experienced a period of peace. After 680, the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> was in the throes of the <a href="Second%20Fitna">Second Muslim Civil War</a> and the consequent Byzantine ascendancy in the East enabled the emperors to extract huge amounts of tribute from the Umayyad government in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. In 692, as the Umayyads emerged as victors from the Muslim Civil War, Emperor <a href="Justinian%20II">Justinian II</a> () re-opened hostilities. The result was a series of Arab victories that led to the loss of Byzantine control over <a href="Armenian%20Highland">Armenia</a> and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasian</a> principalities, and a gradual encroachment upon Byzantine borderlands. Year by year, the Caliphate's generals, usually members of the Umayyad family, launched raids into Byzantine territory and captured fortresses and towns. After 712, the Byzantine defensive system began to show signs of collapse: Arab raids penetrated further and further into <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, border fortresses were repeatedly attacked and sacked, and references to Byzantine reaction in the sources become more and more scarce. In this, the Arabs were aided by the <a href="Twenty%20Years%27%20Anarchy">prolonged period of internal instability</a> that followed the first deposition of Justinian II in 695, in which the Byzantine throne changed hands seven times in violent coups. In the words of the Byzantinist <a href="Warren%20Treadgold">Warren Treadgold</a>, "the Arab attacks would in any case have intensified after the end of their own civil war ... With far more men, land and wealth than Byzantium, the Arabs had begun to concentrate all their strength against it. Now they threatened to extinguish the empire entirely by capturing its capital."

The information available on the siege comes from sources composed in later dates, which are often mutually contradictory. The main Byzantine source is the extensive and detailed account of the "Chronicle" of <a href="Theophanes%20the%20Confessor">Theophanes the Confessor</a> (760–817) and secondarily the brief account in the "Breviarium" of <a href="Patriarch%20Nikephoros%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople</a> (died 828), which shows small differences, mainly chronological, from Theophanes's version. For the events of the siege, both authors appear to have used a primary account composed during the reign of <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III the Isaurian</a> () which therefore contains a favourable depiction of the latter, while Theophanes apparently relies on an unknown biography of Leo (ignored by Nikephoros) for the events of 716. The 8th-century chronicler Theophilus of Edessa records the years leading up to the siege and the siege itself in some detail, paying particular attention to the diplomacy between Maslama and Leo III. The Arab sources, mainly the 11th-century "<a href="Kitab%20al-%27Uyun">Kitab al-'Uyun</a>" and the more concise narrative in the "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Prophets%20and%20Kings">History of the Prophets and Kings</a>" by <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a> (838–923), rely on primary accounts by early 9th-century Arab writers, but are more confused and contain several legendary elements. The <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac language</a> accounts are based on <a href="Agapius%20of%20Hierapolis">Agapius of Hierapolis</a> (died 942), who likely drew from the same primary source as Theophanes, but are far briefer.

The Arab successes opened the way for a second assault on <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, an undertaking already initiated under Caliph <a href="al-Walid%20I">al-Walid I</a> (). Following his death, his brother and successor <a href="Sulayman%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Sulayman</a> () took up the project with increased vigour, according to Arab accounts because of a prophecy that a Caliph bearing the name of a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> would capture Constantinople; Sulayman (<a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>) was the only member of the Umayyad family to bear such a name. According to Syriac sources, the new Caliph swore "to not stop fighting against Constantinople before having exhausted the country of the Arabs or to have taken the city". The Umayyad forces began assembling at the plain of <a href="Dabiq%2C%20Syria">Dabiq</a> north of Aleppo, under the direct supervision of the Caliph. As Sulayman was too sick to campaign himself, however, he entrusted command to his brother <a href="Maslama%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik</a>. The operation against Constantinople came at a time when the Umayyad empire was undergoing a period of continuous expansion to the east and west. Muslim armies advanced into <a href="Transoxiana">Transoxiana</a>, <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">India</a>, and the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom">Visigothic Kingdom</a> of <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>.

Arab preparations, especially the construction of a large fleet, did not go unnoticed by the worried Byzantines. Emperor <a href="Anastasios%20II">Anastasios II</a> () sent an embassy to Damascus under the <a href="patrikios">patrician</a> and <a href="Eparch%20of%20Constantinople">urban prefect</a>, Daniel of <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinope</a>, ostensibly in order to plea for peace, but in reality to spy on the Arabs. Anastasios, in turn, began to prepare for the inevitable siege: the <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">fortifications</a> of Constantinople were repaired and equipped with ample artillery (<a href="catapult">catapult</a>s and other <a href="siege%20weapons">siege weapons</a>), while food stores were brought into the city. In addition, those inhabitants who could not stockpile food for at least three years were evacuated. Anastasios strengthened his navy and in early 715 dispatched it against the Arab fleet that had come to Phoenix—usually identified with modern <a href="Finike">Finike</a> in <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>, it may also be modern <a href="Fenaket">Fenaket</a> across <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, or perhaps <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> (modern <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>), famed for its <a href="Cedrus%20libani">cedar</a> forests—to collect timber for their ships. At Rhodes, however, the Byzantine fleet, encouraged by the soldiers of the <a href="Opsician%20Theme">Opsician Theme</a>, rebelled, killed their commander John the Deacon and sailed north to <a href="Edremit%2C%20Bal%C4%B1kesir">Adramyttium</a>. There, they acclaimed a reluctant tax collector, <a href="Theodosius%20III">Theodosius</a>, as emperor. Anastasios crossed into <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a> in the Opsician Theme to confront the rebellion, but the rebel fleet sailed on to <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar%23Chrysopolis">Chrysopolis</a>. From there, it launched attacks against Constantinople, until, in late summer, sympathizers within the capital opened its gates to them. Anastasios held out at <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a> for several months, finally agreeing to resign and retire as a monk. The accession of Theodosios, who from the sources comes across as both unwilling and incapable, as a puppet emperor of the Opsicians provoked the reaction of the other themes, especially the <a href="Anatolics">Anatolics</a> and the <a href="Armeniacs">Armeniacs</a> under their respective "<a href="strategos">strategoi</a>" (generals) Leo the Isaurian and <a href="Artabasdos">Artabasdos</a>.

In these conditions of near-civil war, the Arabs began their carefully prepared advance. In September 715, the vanguard, under general Sulayman ibn Mu'ad, marched over <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> into Asia Minor, taking the strategic fortress of <a href="Loulon">Loulon</a> on its way. They wintered at Afik, an unidentified location near the western exit of the <a href="Cilician%20Gates">Cilician Gates</a>. In early 716, Sulayman's army continued into central Asia Minor. The Umayyad fleet under <a href="Umar%20ibn%20Hubayra">Umar ibn Hubayra</a> cruised along the Cilician coast, while Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik awaited developments with the main army in Syria.

The Arabs hoped that the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already established contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a <a href="vassal">vassal</a> of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.

Sulayman's first objective was the strategically important fortress of <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>, which the Arabs intended to use as a base the following winter. Amorium had been left defenceless in the turmoil of the civil war and would have easily fallen, but the Arabs chose to bolster Leo's position as a counterweight to Theodosios. They offered the city terms of surrender if its inhabitants would acknowledge Leo as emperor. The fortress capitulated, but still did not open its gates to the Arabs. Leo came to the vicinity with a handful of soldiers and executed a series of ruses and negotiations to garrison 800 men in the town. The Arab army, thwarted in its objective and with supplies running low, withdrew. Leo escaped to <a href="Pisidia">Pisidia</a> and, in summer, supported by Artabasdos, was proclaimed and crowned as Byzantine emperor, openly challenging Theodosios.
Leo's success at Amorium was fortunately timed, since Maslama with the main Arab army had in the meantime crossed the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a> and was marching straight for the city. In addition, as the Arab general had not received news of Leo's double-dealing, he did not devastate the territories he marched through—the Armeniac and Anatolic themes, whose governors he still believed to be his allies. On meeting up with Sulayman's retreating army and learning what had transpired, Maslama changed direction: he attacked <a href="Akroinon">Akroinon</a> and from there marched to the western coastlands to spend the winter. On his way, he sacked <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a> and <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>. The Arab fleet wintered in Cilicia. Leo, in the meantime, began his own march on Constantinople. He captured <a href="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a>, where he found and captured, among other officials, Theodosios's son, and then marched to Chrysopolis. In spring 717, after short negotiations, he secured Theodosios's resignation and his recognition as emperor, entering the capital on 25 March. Theodosios and his son were allowed to retire to a monastery as monks, while Artabasdos was promoted to the position of "<a href="kouropalates">kouropalates</a>" and received the hand of Leo's daughter, <a href="Anna%2C%20wife%20of%20Artabasdos">Anna</a>.

From the outset, the Arabs prepared for a major assault on Constantinople. The late 8th-century Syriac "<a href="Zuqnin%20Chronicle">Zuqnin Chronicle</a>" reports that the Arabs were "innumerable", while the 12th-century Syriac chronicler <a href="Michael%20the%20Syrian">Michael the Syrian</a> mentions a much-inflated 200,000 men and 5,000 ships. The 10th-century Arab writer <a href="al-Mas%27udi">al-Mas'udi</a> mentions 120,000 troops, and the account of Theophanes the Confessor 1,800 ships. Supplies for several years were hoarded, and siege engines and incendiary materials (<a href="naphtha">naphtha</a>) were stockpiled. The supply train alone is said to have numbered 12,000 men, 6,000 camels and 6,000 donkeys, while according to the 13th-century historian <a href="Bar%20Hebraeus">Bar Hebraeus</a>, the troops included 30,000 volunteers ("mutawa") for the Holy War ("<a href="jihad">jihad</a>"). 

Whatever the true numbers, the attackers were considerably more numerous than the defenders; according to Treadgold, the Arab host may have outnumbered the entire <a href="Byzantine%20army">Byzantine army</a>. Little is known on the detailed composition of the Arab force, but it appears that it mostly consisted of, and was led by, <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syrians</a> and <a href="Al-Jazira%2C%20Mesopotamia">Jazirans</a> of the elite "ahl al-Sham" ("People of Syria"), the main pillar of the Umayyad regime and veterans of the struggle against Byzantium. Alongside Maslama, Umar ibn Hubayra, Sulayman ibn Mu'ad, and Bakhtari ibn al-Hasan are mentioned as his lieutenants by Theophanes and Agapius of Hierapolis, while the later "Kitab al-'Uyun" replaces Bakhtari with <a href="Abdallah%20al-Battal">Abdallah al-Battal</a>.
Although the siege consumed a large part of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near <a href="Melitene">Melitene</a> and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgars</a>, with whom Leo <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Bulgarian%20Treaty%20of%20716">concluded a treaty</a> that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.

In early summer, Maslama ordered his fleet to join him and with his army crossed the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> (<a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>) at <a href="Abydos%20%28Hellespont%29">Abydos</a> into <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. The Arabs began their march on Cοnstantinople, thoroughly devastating the countryside, gathering supplies, and sacking the towns they encountered. In mid-July or mid-August, the Arab army reached Constantinople and isolated it completely on land by building a <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">double siege wall</a> of stone, one facing the city and one facing the Thracian countryside, with their camp positioned between them. According to Arab sources, at this point Leo offered to ransom the city by paying a <a href="solidus%20%28coin%29">gold coin</a> for every inhabitant, but Maslama replied that there could not be peace with the vanquished, and that the Arab garrison of Constantinople had already been selected.

The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often confused with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, anchoring at first near the <a href="Hebdomon">Hebdomon</a>. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> and the various squadrons began anchoring by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a> to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, while the rest of the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between <a href="Galata">Galata</a> and <a href="Defterdarburnu">Kleidion</a>, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the <a href="Princes%27%20Islands">Princes' Islands</a> of <a href="Sivriada">Oxeia</a> and <a href="Yass%C4%B1ada">Plateia</a>. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the Arabs, who, according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering paddles. The same night, Leo drew up the <a href="Boom%20%28navigational%20barrier%29">chain</a> between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a>. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of <a href="Sosthenion">Sosthenion</a> further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.

The Arab army was well-provisioned, with Arab accounts reporting high mounds of supplies piled up in their camp, and had even brought along <a href="wheat">wheat</a> to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for <a href="foraging">foraging</a>. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show the inhabitants of the city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the <a href="Lombards">Lombard</a> historian <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a> put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.

The situation looked set to improve in spring when the new Caliph, <a href="Umar%20II">Umar II</a> (), sent two fleets to the besiegers' aid: 400 ships from <a href="Medieval%20Egypt">Egypt</a> under a commander named Sufyan and 360 ships from <a href="Ifriqiya">Africa</a> under Izid, all laden with supplies and arms. At the same time, a fresh army began marching through Asia Minor to assist in the siege. When the new fleets arrived in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, they kept their distance from the Byzantines and anchored on the Asian shore, the Egyptians in the Gulf of Nicomedia near modern <a href="Tuzla%20%28district%29">Tuzla</a> and the Africans south of Chalcedon (at <a href="K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCkyal%C4%B1">Satyros</a>, <a href="Maltepe%2C%20Istanbul">Bryas</a> and <a href="Kartal">Kartal</a>imen). Most of the Arab fleets' crews were composed of <a href="Copts">Christian Egyptians</a>, however, and they began deserting to the Byzantines upon their arrival. Notified by the Egyptians of the advent and disposition of the Arab reinforcements, Leo launched his fleet in an attack against the new Arab fleets. Crippled by the defection of their crews, and helpless against Greek fire, the Arab ships were destroyed or captured along with the weapons and supplies they carried. Constantinople was now safe from a seaborne attack. On land too the Byzantines were victorious: their troops managed to ambush the advancing Arab army under a commander named Mardasan and destroy it in the hills around <a href="Sapanca">Sophon</a>, south of Nicomedia.

Constantinople could now be easily resupplied by sea and the city's fishermen went back to work, as the Arab fleet did not sail again. Still suffering from hunger and pestilence, the Arabs lost a major battle against the Bulgars, who killed, according to Theophanes, 22,000 men. It is unclear, however, whether the Bulgars attacked the Arab encampment because of their treaty with Leo or whether the Arabs strayed into Bulgar territory seeking provisions, as reported by the Syriac "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20846">Chronicle of 846</a>". Michael the Syrian mentions that the Bulgars participated in the siege from the beginning, with attacks against the Arabs as they marched through Thrace and subsequently on their encampment, but this is not corroborated elsewhere. The siege had clearly failed, and Caliph Umar sent orders to Maslama to retreat. After thirteen months of siege, on 15 August 718, the Arabs departed. The date coincided with the feast of the <a href="Dormition%20of%20the%20Theotokos">Dormition of the Theotokos</a> (Assumption of Mary), and it was to her that the Byzantines ascribed their victory. The retreating Arabs were not hindered or attacked on their return, but their fleet lost more ships in a storm in the Marmara Sea, while other ships were set afire by ashes from the volcano of <a href="Santorini">Santorini</a>, and some of the survivors were captured by the Byzantines, so that Theophanes claims that only five vessels made it back to Syria. Arab sources claim that altogether 150,000 Muslims perished during the campaign, a figure which, according to the Byzantinist <a href="John%20Haldon">John Haldon</a>, "while certainly inflated, is nevertheless indicative of the enormity of the disaster in medieval eyes".

The expedition's failure weakened the Umayyad state. As historian <a href="Bernard%20Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> commented, "Its failure brought a grave moment for Umayyad power. The financial strain of equipping and maintaining the expedition caused an aggravation of the fiscal and financial oppression which had already aroused such dangerous opposition. The destruction of the fleet and army of Syria at the sea walls of Constantinople deprived the regime of the chief material basis of its power". The blow to the Caliphate's might was severe, and although the land army did not suffer losses in the same degree as the fleet, Umar is recorded as contemplating withdrawing from the recent conquests of <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Spain">Hispania</a> and <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Transoxiana">Transoxiana</a>, as well as a complete evacuation of Cilicia and other Byzantine territories that the Arabs had seized over the previous years. Although his advisors dissuaded him from such drastic actions, most Arab garrisons were withdrawn from the Byzantine frontier districts they had occupied in the lead-up to the siege. In Cilicia, only <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a> remained in Arab hands as a defensive bulwark to protect <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. The Byzantines even recovered some territory in western Armenia for a time. In 719, the Byzantine fleet raided the Syrian coast and burned down the port of <a href="Latakia">Laodicea</a> and, in 720 or 721, the Byzantines attacked and sacked <a href="Tinnis">Tinnis</a> in Egypt. Leo also restored control over <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where news of the Arab siege of Constantinople and expectations of the city's fall had prompted the local governor to declare an emperor of his own, <a href="Basil%20Onomagoulos">Basil Onomagoulos</a>. It was during this time, however, that effective Byzantine control over <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> ceased. 

Besides this, the Byzantines failed to exploit their success in launching attacks of their own against the Arabs. In 720, after a hiatus of two years, Arab raids against Byzantium resumed, although now they were no longer directed at conquest, but rather seeking booty. The Arab attacks would intensify again over the next two decades, until the major Byzantine victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Akroinon">Battle of Akroinon</a> in 740. Coupled with military defeats on the other fronts of the overextended Caliphate, and the <a href="Third%20Fitna">internal instability</a> which culminated in the <a href="Abbasid%20Revolution">Abbasid Revolution</a>, the age of Arab expansion came to an end.

The second Arab siege of Constantinople was far more dangerous for Byzantium than the first as, unlike the loose blockade of 674–678, the Arabs launched a direct, well-planned attack on the Byzantine capital, and tried to cut off the city completely from land and sea. The siege represented a final effort by the Caliphate to "cut off the head" of the Byzantine Empire, after which the remaining provinces, especially in Asia Minor, would be easy to capture. The reasons for the Arab failure were chiefly logistical, as they were operating too far from their Syrian bases, but the superiority of the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire, the strength of Constantinople's fortifications, and the skill of Leo III in deception and negotiations also played important roles.
The failure of the Arab siege led to a profound change in the nature of warfare between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The Muslim goal of conquest of Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Antitaurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids. In this incessant border warfare, frontier towns and fortresses changed hands frequently, but the general outline of the border remained unaltered for over two centuries, until the Byzantine conquests of the 10th century. The eastern fleets of the Caliphate entered a century-long decline; only the Ifriqiyan fleets maintained regular raids on Byzantine Sicily, until they too subsided after 752. Indeed, with the exception of the <a href="Abbasid%20invasion%20of%20Asia%20Minor%20%28782%29">advance</a> of the Abbasid army under <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> up to Chrysopolis in 782, no other Arab army would ever come within sight of the Byzantine capital again. Consequently, on the Muslim side the raids themselves eventually acquired an almost ritual character, and were valued mostly as a demonstration of the continuing "jihad" and sponsored by the Caliph as a symbol of his role as the leader of the Muslim community.

The outcome of the siege was of considerable <a href="macrohistorical">macrohistorical</a> importance. The Byzantine capital's survival preserved the Empire as a bulwark against Islamic expansion into Europe until the 15th century, when it <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">fell</a> to the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a>. Along with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tours">Battle of Tours</a> in 732, the successful defence of Constantinople has been seen as instrumental in stopping Muslim expansion into Europe. Historian Ekkehard Eickhoff writes that "had a victorious Caliph made Constantinople already at the beginning of the Middle Ages into the political capital of Islam, as happened at the end of the Middle Ages by the Ottomans—the consequences for Christian Europe [...] would have been incalculable", as the Mediterranean would have become an Arab lake, and the Germanic successor states in Western Europe would have been cut off from the Mediterranean roots of their culture. Military historian <a href="Paul%20K.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">Paul K. Davis</a> summed up the siege's importance as follows: "By turning back the Moslem invasion, Europe remained in Christian hands, and no serious Moslem threat to Europe existed until the fifteenth century. This victory, coincident with the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> victory at Tours (732), limited Islam's western expansion to the southern Mediterranean world." Thus the historian <a href="J.%20B.%20Bury">John B. Bury</a> called 718 "an ecumenical date", while the Greek historian <a href="Spyridon%20Lambros">Spyridon Lambros</a> likened the siege to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a> and Leo III to <a href="Miltiades">Miltiades</a>. Consequently, military historians often include the siege in lists of the "decisive battles" of world history.

Among Arabs, the 717–718 siege became the most famous of their expeditions against Byzantium. Several accounts survive, but most were composed at later dates and are semi-fictional and contradictory. In legend, the defeat was transformed into a victory: Maslama departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders, where Leo received him with honour and led him to the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. After Leo paid homage to Maslama and promised tribute, Maslama and his troops—30,000 out of the original 80,000 that set out for Constantinople—departed for Syria. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in <a href="Arabic%20epic%20literature">Arabic epic literature</a>. A siege of Constantinople is found in the tale of Omar bin al-Nu'uman and his sons in the "<a href="Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Thousand and One Nights</a>", while both Maslama and the Caliph Sulayman appear in a tale of the "<a href="A%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Nights%20%28poetry%29">Hundred and One Nights</a>" from the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. The commander of Maslama's bodyguard, Abdallah al-Battal, became a celebrated figure in Arab and Turkish poetry as "<a href="Battal%20Gazi">Battal Gazi</a>" for his exploits in the Arab raids of the next decades. Similarly, the 10th-century epic "<a href="Delhemma">Delhemma</a>", related to the cycle around Battal, gives a fictionalized version of the 717–718 siege.

Later Muslim and Byzantine tradition also ascribed the building of Constantinople's first <a href="mosque">mosque</a>, near the city's "<a href="praetorium">praetorium</a>", to Maslama. In reality, the mosque near the "praetorium" was probably erected in about 860, as a result of an Arab embassy in that year. <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> tradition also ascribed the building of the <a href="Arap%20Mosque">Arap Mosque</a> (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s. The passing of the Arab army also left traces at Abydos, where "Maslama's Well" and a mosque attributed to him were still known in the 10th century.

Eventually, following their repeated failures before Constantinople, and the continued resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came to be regarded as one of the signs of the arrival of the <a href="end%20times">end times</a> in <a href="Islamic%20eschatology">Islamic eschatology</a>. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac "<a href="Apocalypse%20of%20Pseudo-Methodius">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</a>" and the "<a href="Apocalypse%20of%20Daniel">Apocalypse of Daniel</a>", written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.

Oregon State Capitol

The Oregon State Capitol is the building housing the <a href="Oregon%20Legislative%20Assembly">state legislature</a> and the offices of the <a href="Governor%20of%20Oregon">governor</a>, <a href="Oregon%20Secretary%20of%20State">secretary of state</a>, and <a href="Oregon%20State%20Treasurer">treasurer</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. It is located in the <a href="List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States">state capital</a>, <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a>. The current building, constructed from 1936 to 1938, and expanded in 1977, is the third to house the <a href="Government%20of%20Oregon">Oregon state government</a> in Salem. Two former capitol buildings were destroyed by fire, one in 1855 and the other in 1935.

New York architects <a href="Trowbridge%20%26amp%3B%20Livingston">Trowbridge & Livingston</a> conceived the current structure's <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>, <a href="Stripped%20Classicism">stripped classical</a> design, in association with Francis Keally. Much of the interior and exterior is made of <a href="marble">marble</a>. The Oregon State Capitol was placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on June 29, 1988.

The <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a>, part of the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a>, partially financed construction, which was completed during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, in 1938. The building was erected at a cost of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>2.5 million for the central portion of the building, which includes a <a href="dome">dome</a> of . The wings, which doubled the floor space of the building to about , were added later for $12.5 million. The grounds outside the capitol building contain artwork, fountains, and flora, including the state tree (<a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>) and state flower (<a href="Oregon%20grape">Oregon grape</a>).

Before the creation of the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a> in 1848, the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a> <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Oregon">provisional government</a>, through legislation on June 27, 1844, and December 19, 1845, selected <a href="Oregon%20City%2C%20Oregon">Oregon City</a> as the capitol. Thus Oregon's first capitol was in Oregon City. J. Quinn Thornton described an early capitol buildings as twenty by forty feet, with a platform at one end for the president. One of the private buildings used by this government was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. The designation of Oregon City as the seat of power was by proclamation of Governor <a href="Joseph%20Lane">Joseph Lane</a>. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor <a href="John%20P.%20Gaines">John P. Gaines</a> refused to relocate and remained in Oregon City along with the <a href="Oregon%20Supreme%20Court">Oregon Supreme Court</a> (except justice <a href="Orville%20C.%20Pratt">Orville C. Pratt</a>) until an act of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> on May 14, 1852, settled the matter in Salem's favor.

On January 13, 1855, the <a href="Oregon%20Territorial%20Legislature">Oregon Territorial Legislature</a> passed a bill moving the seat of government from Salem to <a href="Corvallis%2C%20Oregon">Corvallis</a>. Governor <a href="George%20Law%20Curry">George Law Curry</a> and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent the matter to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where Secretary <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28American%20politician%29">James Guthrie</a> declared the move invalid unless acted on by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State <a href="Benjamin%20Harding">Benjamin Harding</a> moved back to Salem.

On December 3, 1855, the legislature convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation to move the capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, the legislature re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask the people of the territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a <a href="Two-round%20system">runoff</a>. The initial vote set up a runoff between <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene</a> and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem.

A permanent resolution of the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular vote. On a vote in 1862, no city received the 50 percent minimum required by law. In an 1864 election, Salem received 79 percent and was declared the state capital. The <a href="Oregon%20Constitution">Oregon Constitution</a> lists the seat of state government in Article XIV as Marion County, of which Salem is the seat.

The land developed for the permanent capitol buildings was Salem block 84, sold to the state for this purpose by pioneer and Salem founder <a href="William%20H.%20Willson">W. H. Willson</a>. Construction of the first capitol building began in 1854, shortly after Congress confirmed Salem as the capital city. However, with the capital moving to Corvallis the next year, construction was temporarily halted. After the capital's return to Salem, the building was nearly completed by late 1855. This territorial capitol, of <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival-style</a>, stood wide and long (15 by 23 m), with a stone <a href="facade">facade</a> and a 10-foot (3 m) <a href="portico">portico</a>. Built of native <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> blocks, the exterior walls, two stories high, ranged in color from a deep sky blue to white. The first floor was tall and the second tall with an eight-foot (2.4 m) <a href="entablature">entablature</a>. The building was decorated with four <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic columns</a> on the front (west) end. The building housed a variety of rooms, including a federal courthouse with a chamber measuring 20 by 27 feet (6 by 8 m) and an executive office of 18 by 20 ft (5.5 by 6 m) on the first floor. Also on the first floor was the House chamber, measuring 36 by 46 feet (11 by 14 m) and having three entrances. The first floor also held the main hall, which included an entrance wide. On the second floor was the Senate chamber, 26 by 36 feet (8 by 11 m). Additionally, the Territorial Library was housed in a room that was 20 by 36 feet (6 by 11 m). The second story also had a gallery viewing area for the House, three committee rooms, and several rooms for government clerks. The capitol was designed by Captain Charles Bennet, who participated in the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, and construction supervised by William H. Richter at a total cost of $25,000.

On the evening of December 29, 1855, a fire destroyed the first capitol building and many of the territory's public records. Starting in the unfinished northeast corner of the structure, still unoccupied by the government, the fire was not discovered until around 12:30 am. <a href="Arson">Arson</a> was suspected, but no one was arrested.

The site of the burned-out capitol building remained a pile of stones for several years after the fire. A downtown building, Nesmith's Building (later named the Holman Building), served as a temporary capitol from 1859 until 1876. The legislature met on the second and third floors of that building, which also housed the other state offices.

Plans for a new building began to take shape in 1872 when the state legislature appropriated $100,000 ($  as of 2019) towards a new capitol building. This second capitol, built between 1873 and 1876, was a two-<a href="storey">story</a> structure with an additional first level that was partly underground; the total cost was $325,000 ($  as of 2019). The <a href="cornerstone">cornerstone</a> for the building was laid on October 5, 1873, during a ceremony that included a speech by Governor <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Chadwick">Stephen F. Chadwick</a> and the music of several bands. Construction, on the same site as the 1855 building, was partly accomplished with convict labor from the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Penitentiary">Oregon State Penitentiary</a>. Architects <a href="Justus%20F.%20Krumbein">Justus F. Krumbein</a> and W.G. Gilbert designed the building.

Built of stone and five million bricks, Oregon's new capitol measured 275 by 136 feet (84 by 41 m) with a dome of . The ground story was of native Oregon <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> from the <a href="Umpqua%20River">Umpqua</a> region. The structure had a square <a href="rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a> on the interior that was tall. Also inside was a Senate chamber measuring 75 by 45 feet (23 by 14 m) and a House chamber of 85 by 75 feet (26 by 23 m). On the top floor was the <a href="Oregon%20Supreme%20Court">Oregon Supreme Court</a> with a courtroom measuring 54 by 45 feet (16 by 14 m) and the Oregon State Law Library, 75 by 70 feet (23 by 21 m). Also on the top floor was a viewing gallery for the House. On the exterior were ornamental <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and two-story porticos on the east and west ends. The building included a <a href="lunch%20counter">lunch counter</a>. Additionally, the building had <a href="mullion">mullion</a>-windowed wings. The large copper-clad dome was constructed with an iron and steel framework. This dome rose above the rest of the building and was tall. The building was of <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance</a> style with <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian columns</a> on the front entrance and was patterned after the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a>. At that time, the capitol faced west toward the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a>. The government began using the building in August 1876, before the dome was built. Originally, plans called for towers on both sides of the dome (a tower on both ends of the building with the dome in the middle), but they were left out to save money. Oregon's second capitol building stood from 1876 to 1935.

On April 25, 1935, at 6:43 pm, a custodial engineer called the Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove items from the smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old <a href="Mark%20Hatfield">Mark Hatfield</a>, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started in the basement of the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.

Flames could be seen as far away as Corvallis. One volunteer firefighter, Floyd McMullen, a student at <a href="Willamette%20University">Willamette University</a>, died in the fire, which drew firefighters from as far away as <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>. Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene; three more came from Portland. Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished. Losses were estimated at $1.5 million ($  as of 2019), and the state did not carry insurance. The losses, which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors, could have been worse had the state not used fire-proof vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $1 million ($  as of 2019) in stocks and bonds. During the blaze, firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating. Years earlier, the state had turned over many historical documents to the <a href="Oregon%20Historical%20Society">Oregon Historical Society</a> in Portland for preservation, and those records were preserved. Although the Supreme Court had moved to the <a href="Oregon%20Supreme%20Court%20Building">Oregon Supreme Court Building</a> in 1914, the two buildings were connected by underground tunnels used for electricity and heating. At the time of the fire, the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Library">Oregon State Library</a> was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded underground tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building. Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built.

Construction of the newest building began on December 4, 1936. The third state capitol was completed June 18, 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Leslie%20M.%20Scott">Leslie M. Scott</a>, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Sawyer">Robert W. Sawyer</a>, and Oregon Governor <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Martin">Charles Henry Martin</a>. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, the design of the new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design was labeled a combination of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">Egyptian</a> simplicity and <a href="Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> refinement. Overall it is Art Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.

Controversy occurred before construction began when Governor Martin suggested the new building be sited on a hill south of downtown (Candalaria Heights) and away from the busy center of town. Another proposal called for the purchase of the Willamette University campus and relocation of the capitol to that site. However, downtown merchants were able to keep the capitol building in downtown at the original location, though some <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> homes were subsequently leveled to make way for the building. Another early complaint about the structure was that the <a href="cupola">cupola</a> resembled a "paint can" rather than traditional domes on other capitols, including the earlier Oregon structures. It was even called a "squirrel cage", lacking in majesty. Additionally, the public was slow to admire the gold <a href="Oregon%20Pioneer">Oregon Pioneer</a> atop the dome. Installation of the statue began on September 17, 1938, and took several days and heavy-duty equipment.

The building cost $2.5 million ($  as of 2019), of which the federal government paid 45 percent through the <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a>. Upon completion, the new capitol was wide, long, and tall (50 by 122 by 51 m) and contained of usable space. The exterior was finished with Vermont <a href="marble">marble</a>. The lobby, rotunda, and halls were lined with a polished rose <a href="travertine">travertine</a> stone quarried in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. The rotunda's staircases and floor used <a href="http%3A//quarriesandbeyond.org/states/mo/pdf/napoleon_gray_an_adaptable_marble-phenix_marble_co-1926.pdf">Phenix Napoleon Grey Marble</a> quarried in <a href="Phenix%2C%20Missouri">Phenix</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and had borders of Radio Black marble that, like the exterior stone, is from <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>. There are 158 names of notable Oregonians inscribed on the walls of the legislative chambers; of these, only six are women. The original cost estimate for the building was $3.5 million ($  as of 2019), but the state legislature only appropriated $2.5 million; committee rooms were subsequently removed from the plans. These rooms were added in 1977 as part of a $12.5 million ($  as of 2019) expansion project to add new wings containing legislative offices, hearing rooms, support services, a first floor galleria, and underground parking. This addition doubled the space of the capitol building. In 2002, the wings were remodeled at a cost of $1.3 million ($  as of 2019) to upgrade items such as antiquated wiring and to install new carpeting and lighting.

On March 25, 1993, the magnitude 5.6 <a href="1993%20Scotts%20Mills%20earthquake">Scotts Mills earthquake</a> damaged the dome, requiring closure for repairs. The rotunda area remained closed for approximately two years for these repairs. This "Spring Break Quake" shook the building enough to shift the statue on top and crack the dome. Additionally, the quake created a three-foot (one-meter) bulge on the west end of the building. Repairs cost $4.3 million ($  as of 2019) and included reinforcing the structure with additional concrete and steel bars.

In April 2002, the building became the first state capitol in the United States to produce <a href="solar%20power">solar power</a> through the use of 60 <a href="photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> panels generating 7.8 kilowatts. One-third of the power is used to light the Oregon Pioneer at night; the remaining <a href="electricity">electricity</a> is sent into the <a href="power%20grid">power grid</a>.

On December 31, 2007, the Oregon State Capitol hosted its first authorized wedding between Oregon State Representative <a href="Tobias%20Read">Tobias Read</a> and Heidi Eggert. At Read's encouragement, the Legislature created a policy authorizing up to four public events a year. On August 30, 2008, the building caught fire around 12:30 in the morning and was quickly extinguished with damage to the Governor's offices on the second floor on the south side. The governor was forced to relocate some of his offices, including some time at the Oregon State Library across the street.

The Oregon State Capitol is home to both branches of the state legislature, the House and Senate, and has offices for the governor, treasurer, and the secretary of state. In its center, the floor of the prominent <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a> features an embedded <a href="Seal%20of%20Oregon">Oregon State Seal</a> sculpted in bronze by <a href="Ulric%20Ellerhusen">Ulric Ellerhusen</a>. Ellerhusen also sculpted the <a href="Oregon%20Pioneer%20%28statue%29">Oregon Pioneer</a> that rests atop the capitol dome's exterior. The dome rises above the state seal. The interior of the dome was painted by <a href="Frank%20H.%20Schwarz">Frank H. Schwarz</a> and features 33 stars, symbolizing Oregon's place as the 33rd state to join the Union. Eight medallions are painted near the top of the walls of the rotunda that represent the eight objects in the state seal. Also encircling the interior of the rotunda are four murals depicting moments from Oregon history. One mural depicts Captain <a href="Robert%20Gray%20%28sea-captain%29">Robert Gray</a>'s <a href="Gray%20sails%20the%20Columbia%20River">exploration of the Columbia River</a> in 1792, another shows the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, and two others portray <a href="Conestoga%20wagon">covered wagons</a> from pioneer times. These four murals were painted by Schwarz and <a href="Barry%20Faulkner">Barry Faulkner</a>. Other murals include the <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Oregon">Provisional Government of Oregon</a>'s salmon and wheat seal, the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>'s seal, and depictions of Oregon's industries, all located in the rotunda's wings along the grand staircase. The capitol's galleria area on the first floor includes hearing rooms, display cases, and the visitor information area.

Oregon's House chamber floor is covered with a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern incorporates a depiction of the state tree, the Douglas-fir, representative of <a href="forestry">forestry</a>. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden <a href="oak">oak</a>. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 <a href="Champoeg%20Meetings">Champoeg Meetings</a> at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use <a href="black%20walnut">black walnut</a> for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a> and <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, representative of <a href="fishing">fishing</a> and <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On the second floor of the capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (<a href="western%20meadowlark">western meadowlark</a>).

A variety of artwork is displayed on the exterior of the building. Sculptor <a href="Leo%20Friedlander">Leo Friedlander</a> used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures on both sides of the main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and <a href="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse ("<a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20%28sculpture%29">Lewis and Clark</a>"); the other ("<a href="Covered%20Wagon%20%28sculpture%29">Covered Wagon</a>") shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.

The building measures 693 by 259.5 ft (211.2 by 79.1 m). The older main portion of the building is tall, while the newer wings added in 1977 are tall. Inside, the building has approximately of floor area and 3.2 million cubic feet (90,600 cubic meters) of volume.

In 1997, the Legislative Assembly established the <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit</a> <a href="Oregon%20State%20Capitol%20Foundation">Oregon State Capitol Foundation</a> in order to "create a living history, enhance the dignity and beauty of the Capitol, and foster cultural and educational opportunities." In 2005, the foundation completed the Walk of the Flags project, a display in Willson Park on the capitol grounds of all 50 <a href="flags%20of%20the%20U.S.%20states">flags of the U.S. states</a>.

In 2007, the capitol wings closed for a restoration project to upgrade items such as furniture, plumbing, and electrical systems. The $34 million project became an issue in the 2008 Senate campaign between <a href="Gordon%20Smith%20%28politician%29">Gordon Smith</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Merkley">Jeff Merkley</a> when Smith used the price of the project in ads attacking Merkley who was the Speaker of the Oregon House when the remodel was approved. Part of the attack involved the cost of new desks for legislators and staff that were <a href="Oregon%20Corrections%20Enterprises">manufactured by Oregon prison inmates</a>. Renovations were completed in November 2008.

The capitol grounds cover three city blocks and include Willson and Capitol parks. Near the west entrance of the capitol is a <a href="Liberty%20Bell%20%28Oregon%20State%20Capitol%29">replica</a> of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>'s <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a>. This bell is one of 53 full-sized replicas made in <a href="France">France</a> and donated by the United States government to each state. Oregon received its copy on July 4, 1950. Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including <a href="blue%20spruce">blue spruce</a>, <a href="Oregon-grape">Oregon-grape</a> (the <a href="floral%20emblem">state flower</a>), <a href="Sequoiadendron%20giganteum">giant sequoia</a>, <a href="Sequoia%20sempervirens">coast redwood</a>, <a href="Acer%20palmatum">Japanese maple</a>, <a href="dogwood">dogwood</a> species, <a href="Callery%20pear">Bradford pear</a>, <a href="cherry">cherry</a> tree species, <a href="European%20holly">English holly</a>, <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>, and <a href="magnolia">magnolia</a> tree species. One <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a> to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from <a href="Oregon%20State%20University">Oregon State University</a>.

On the east side of the building is Capitol Park, which includes a bronze equestrian statue by <a href="Alexander%20Phimister%20Proctor">A. Phimister Proctor</a> called "<a href="The%20Circuit%20Rider">The Circuit Rider</a>", statues of <a href="Jason%20Lee%20%28missionary%29">Jason Lee</a> ("<a href="Jason%20Lee%20%28Proctor%29">Jason Lee</a>") and <a href="John%20McLoughlin">John McLoughlin</a> ("<a href="John%20McLoughlin%20%28Proctor%29">John McLoughlin</a>") by Gifford Proctor, and portions of the Corinthian columns of the second capitol building. Lee established the <a href="Methodist%20Mission">Methodist Mission</a> and what would become <a href="Willamette%20University">Willamette University</a>. McLoughlin, of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, was proclaimed the Father of Oregon. "The Circuit Rider" was added in 1924 as a monument to early preachers. During the <a href="Columbus%20Day%20Storm">Columbus Day Storm</a> in 1962, this statue was knocked over and damaged but restored in 1963. There is also a <a href="Oregon%20Veterans%20Medal%20of%20Honor%20Memorial">memorial to Oregon's recipients</a> of the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, dedicated on September 18, 2004.

To the west of the building is Willson Park, named for Salem founder William H. Willson and sited roughly at the center of his former landholdings. From 1853 to 1965 it was a Salem city park. After the park was turned over to the state, Lloyd Bond and Associates were asked to redesign the park. Willson Park has the <a href="Waite%20Fountain">Waite Fountain</a>, a gazebo built in 1982, and Peter Helzer's sculpture, "<a href="A%20Parade%20of%20Animals">A Parade of Animals</a>" (1991), which was designed as a play structure. Waite Fountain was donated in honor of Oregon businessperson E. M. Waite in 1907 by his wife. The <a href="Breyman%20Fountain">Breyman Fountain</a>, added in 1904 as a memorial to Werner and Eugene Breyman, is at the far west end of the park. It was originally decorated with a statue of a soldier from the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and also served as a lamp post and horse trough. Today the statue holds no water and is sometimes planted with flowers. In 2005, a <a href="Walk%20of%20Flags">Walk of Flags</a> feature was added that displays the flags of every state in the Union. In 2009, the nine flags of Oregon's <a href="List%20of%20federally%20recognized%20Native%20American%20tribes%20in%20Oregon">federally recognized Native American tribes</a> were added to the Walk of Flags.

Other features on the capitol grounds include <a href="Sprague%20Fountain">Sprague Fountain</a> and the <a href="Wall%20of%20Water">Wall of Water</a>. The Wall of Water is located across Court Street from the main entrance. It was added in 1990 and has 22 nozzles shooting water into the air in a plaza that also has slabs of stone with information about Oregon's history. Added in 1985, the "<a href="Capitol%20Beaver%20Family">Capitol Beaver Family</a>" sculpture represents the <a href="American%20beaver">state animal</a>. Additional features of the grounds include a <a href="peace%20pole">peace pole</a> donated by the Society of Prayer for World Peace, a large boulder that once lay along the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>, a planter that spells out "Oregon" using shrubs, and a rose garden maintained by the <a href="Salem%20Rose%20Society">Salem Rose Society</a>.

The Heart of a Woman

The Heart of a Woman (1981) is an <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> by American writer <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>. The book is the fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. "The Heart of a Woman" recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> as she raises her teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active in the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, and becomes romantically involved with a South African <a href="Internal%20resistance%20to%20apartheid">anti-apartheid</a> fighter. One of the most important themes of "The Heart of a Woman" is motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.

Like Angelou's previous volumes, the book has been described as <a href="Biography%20in%20literature">autobiographical fiction</a>, though most critics, as well as Angelou, have characterized it as autobiography. Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" more favorably, "The Heart of a Woman" has received positive reviews. It was chosen as an <a href="Oprah%27s%20Book%20Club">Oprah's Book Club</a> selection in 1997.

Critic Mary Jane Lupton says it has "a narrative structure unsurpassed in American autobiography" and that it is Angelou's "most introspective" autobiography. The title is taken from a poem by <a href="Harlem%20Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> poet <a href="Georgia%20Douglas%20Johnson">Georgia Douglas Johnson</a>, which connects Angelou with other female African-American writers. <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a> critic Lyman B. Hagen states, "Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, "The Heart of a Woman" moves its central figures to a point of full personhood". The book follows Angelou to several places in the US and Africa, but the most important journey she describes is "a voyage into the self."

"The Heart of a Woman", published in <a href="1981%20in%20literature">1981</a>, is the fourth installment of <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s series of seven autobiographies. The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou a considerable amount of fame by 1981. "<a href="And%20Still%20I%20Rise">And Still I Rise</a>", her third volume of poetry, was published in 1978 and reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, "<a href="Just%20Give%20Me%20a%20Cool%20Drink%20of%20Water%20%27fore%20I%20Diiie">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie</a>" (1971), was nominated for a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Poetry">Pulitzer Prize</a>.

Writer <a href="Julian%20Mayfield">Julian Mayfield</a> states that Angelou's work set a precedent not only for other black women writers but for the genre of autobiography as a whole. Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women through the writing of her life stories. It made her, as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, "without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer." Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to discuss her personal life publicly, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> calls her a pioneer of self-exposure, willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. While Angelou was composing her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and to "be honest about it."

In 1957, the year "The Heart of a Woman" opens, Angelou had appeared in an <a href="off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> <a href="revue">revue</a> that inspired her first film, "<a href="Calypso%20Heat%20Wave">Calypso Heat Wave</a>", in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions, something she does not mention in the book. Also in 1957 and not discussed in the book, her first album, "<a href="Miss%20Calypso">Miss Calypso</a>", was released; it was reissued as a CD in 1995. According to Als, Angelou sang and performed <a href="calypso%20music">calypso music</a> because it was popular at the time, and not to develop as an artist. As described in "The Heart of a Woman", Angelou eventually gave up performing for a career as a writer and poet. According to Chuck Foster, who wrote the <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> in "Miss Calypso's" 1995 reissue, her calypso music career is "given short shrift" and dismissed in the book.

The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.

The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
And enters some alien cage in its plight,
And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.
-— "The Heart of a Woman", by Georgia Douglas Johnson

Angelou takes the title of her fourth autobiography from a poem by <a href="Georgia%20Douglas%20Johnson">Georgia Douglas Johnson</a>, a <a href="Harlem%20Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> writer. Critic Lyman B. Hagan states that although the title is "less striking or oblique than titles of her preceding books," it is appropriate because Johnson's poem mentions a caged bird and provides a connection to Angelou's first autobiography, whose title was taken from a poem by <a href="Paul%20Lawrence%20Dunbar">Paul Lawrence Dunbar</a>. The title suggests Angelou's painful loneliness and exposes a spiritual dilemma also present in her first volume. Johnson's use of the metaphor is different from Dunbar's because her bird is a female whose isolation is sexual rather than racial. The caged bird may also refer to Angelou after her failed marriage, but writer Mary Jane Lupton says that "the Maya Angelou of "The Heart of a Woman" is too strong and too self-determined to be kept in a cage".

"The Heart of a Woman" is the first time Angelou identifies with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including <a href="James%20Weldon%20Johnson">James Weldon Johnson</a>, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like <a href="Anne%20Spencer">Anne Spencer</a>, <a href="Jessie%20Fauset">Jessie Fauset</a>, <a href="Nella%20Larsen">Nella Larsen</a>, and <a href="Zora%20Neale%20Hurston">Zora Neale Hurston</a>. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.

The events described in "The Heart of a Woman" take place between 1957 and 1962, beginning shortly after the end of Angelou's previous autobiography, "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>". Angelou and her teenage son Guy have moved into a houseboat commune in <a href="Sausalito%2C%20California">Sausalito, California</a>. After a year, they move to a rented house near <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Singer <a href="Billie%20Holiday">Billie Holiday</a> visits Angelou and her son there, and Holiday sings "<a href="Strange%20Fruit">Strange Fruit</a>", her famous song about the <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynching</a> of Black men, to Guy. Holiday tells Angelou, "You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing." In 1959, Angelou and Guy moved to New York City. The transition is difficult for Guy, and Angelou is forced to protect him from a . No longer satisfied with performing in nightclubs, she dedicates herself to acting, writing, political organizing, and her son. Her friend, novelist <a href="John%20Killens">John Killens</a>, invites her to join the <a href="Harlem%20Writers%20Guild">Harlem Writers Guild</a>. She meets other important African-American artists and writers, including <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, who would become her mentor. She becomes a published writer for the first time.

Angelou becomes more politically active and participates in African-American and African protest rallies, including helping to organize a <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a> at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> following the execution of <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, the ousted prime minister of the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. She meets <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> and is struck by his good looks and magnetism. After hearing <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> speak, she and her friend, activist <a href="Godfrey%20Cambridge">Godfrey Cambridge</a>, are inspired to produce a successful fundraising event for King's <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) called "<a href="Cabaret%20For%20Freedom">Cabaret For Freedom</a>". King names her coordinator of SCLC's office in New York. She performs in <a href="Jean%20Genet">Jean Genet</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Blacks%20%28play%29">The Blacks</a>", with <a href="Roscoe%20Lee%20Brown">Roscoe Lee Brown</a>, <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, and <a href="Cicely%20Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a>.

In 1961, Angelou meets South African freedom fighter <a href="Vusumzi%20Make">Vusumzi Make</a>. Angelou and Make never marry, but she and Guy move with Make to London and Cairo, where she acts as his political wife while he is in exile. Their relationship is full of cultural conflicts; he expects her to be a subservient African wife, and she yearns for the freedom of a working woman. She learns that Make is too friendly with other women and is irresponsible with money, so she accepts a position as assistant editor at the "<a href="Arab%20Observer">Arab Observer</a>". Their relationship is examined by their community of friends, and Angelou and Make eventually separate. Angelou accepts a job in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, and she and Guy travel to <a href="Accra">Accra</a>, where he has been accepted to attend college. Guy is seriously injured in an automobile accident, so she begins working at the <a href="University%20of%20Ghana">University of Ghana</a> and remains there while he recuperates. "The Heart of a Woman" ends with Guy leaving for college and Angelou remarking to herself, "At last, I'll be able to eat the whole breast of a roast chicken by myself."

All seven of Angelou's installments of her life story are in the tradition of African-American autobiography. Starting with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>.

All of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the autobiography's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, Angelou calls her books autobiographies, and later acknowledges that she follows the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> tradition of "speaking in the <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person</a> singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying 'I' meaning 'we'". Lupton compares "The Heart of a Woman" with other autobiographies, and states that for the first time in Angelou's series, she is able to present herself as a model for successful living. However, Angelou's "woman's heart"—her perspective as a woman with concerns about her self-esteem and the conflicts with her lovers and her son—is what makes her autobiography different. Angelou's feelings as described in "The Heart of a Woman", which Lupton calls Angelou's "most introspective" book, are what dictates the book's form.

Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to all her books, which differentiate her work from more traditional "truthful" autobiographies. Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist period</a> in the US when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. In a 1998 interview with journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, Angelou discusses her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she states, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories. Hagen states, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work", and that Angelou uses aspects of fiction writing to make her depictions of events and people more interesting. Angelou's long-time editor, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, said that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.

"The Heart of a Woman" is similar to Angelou's previous volumes because it is narrated from the intimate point of view of a woman and a mother, but by this time, she can refer to events that occurred in her past books. Angelou has become a serial autobiographer, something Lupton calls "a narrative structure unsurpassed in American autobiography". Angelou successfully draws upon her previous works, and can build upon the themes she has already explored; for example, Angelou threatens the gang leader who has been threatening her son, a powerful incident when considered in light of Angelou's rape in "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings". Lupton calls Angelou's violent behavior an "unconscious effort to rewrite her own history".

Angelou does not begin to create her own narrative until "The Heart of a Woman", which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. "The Heart of a Woman" is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as a mother and her success as a performer.

Angelou perfects the use of the <a href="vignette%20%28literature%29">vignette</a> in "The Heart of a Woman" to present her acquaintances and close associates. Two of her most developed vignettes in this book are of Billie Holiday and Malcolm X. The vignettes of those she knew well, like Vusumzi Make, also present her interactions and relationships. Hagen writes that although "frank talk seemed to be almost requisite for a commercially successful book" in the early 1980s, Angelou values monogamy, fidelity, and commitment in her relationships.

For the only time in this series, Angelou describes her son's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one, "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>", a technique that centralizes the two books, connects them with each other, creates a strong, emotional link between them, and repeats Angelou's pattern of ending each book on a positive note. In this book, Angelou ends with a hopeful look to the future as her son attains his independence and she looks forward to hers. Hagen writes, "Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, "The Heart of a Woman" moves its central figures to a point of full personhood."

Race, like in the rest of the series, is a central theme in "The Heart of a Woman". The book opens with Angelou and Guy living in an experimental <a href="commune">commune</a> with white people, trying to participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites. She is not completely comfortable with the arrangement; Angelou never names her roommates, even though "naming" has been an important theme in her books thus far. For the most part, Angelou is able to get along well with whites, but she occasionally encounters prejudice, as when she needs help from white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Hagen calls Angelou's descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book "optimistic". Angelou continues her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice.

Angelou becomes more politicized and develops a new sense of Black identity. Even Angelou's decision to leave show business is political. She sees herself as a social and cultural historian of her time, and of the civil rights and Black literary movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s. She becomes more attracted to the causes of <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black militants</a> in the US and Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with a significant militant, and becomes more committed to activism. During this time, she becomes an active political protester, but she does not think of herself in that way. She places the focus upon herself and uses the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the civil rights movement influenced her. According to Hagen, Angelou's contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and "eminently effective".

Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; McPherson writes that it is something of a <a href="national%20myth">national myth</a> to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African-American autobiography, which has its roots in the slave narrative. "The Heart of a Woman" has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.

Like all of Angelou's books, the structure of "The Heart of a Woman" is based on a journey. Angelou emphasizes the theme of movement by opening her book with a <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spiritual</a> ("The ole ark's a-moverin'"), which McPherson calls "the theme song of the United States in 1957". This spiritual, which contains a reference to <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, presents Angelou as a type of <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and demonstrates her spirituality. Angelou mentions <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>'s 1951 novel "<a href="On%20the%20Road">On the Road</a>", thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of literary figures. Even though Angelou travels to Africa for a relationship, she makes a connection with the continent. Lupton states, "Africa is the site of her growth". Angelou's time in Africa makes her more aware of her African roots as she searches for the past of her ancestors. Although Angelou journeys to many places in the book, the most important journey she describes is "a voyage into the self".

Angelou's primary role in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" was stage performer, but in "The Heart of a Woman" she changes from someone who uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this decision for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and so that she can care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers for the first time in "The Heart of a Woman". She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging <a href="second-wave%20feminism">feminism</a>.

Angelou's concept of herself as an artist changed after her encounter with Billie Holiday. Up to that point, Angelou's career was more about fame than about art; Als states, "Developing her artistry was not the point". Als also says that Angelou's busy career, instead of revealing her ambition, shows "a woman who is only moderately talented and perpetually unable to understand who she is". Angelou, in spite of the mistakes of her youth, needed the approval and acceptance of others, and observes that Holiday was able to perceive this. Holiday tells her, "You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing."

Angelou had begun to write sketches, songs and short stories, and shows her work to her friend John Killens, who invites her to New York City to develop her writing skills. She joins the Harlem Writers Guild and receives feedback from other African-American authors such as Killens, <a href="Rosa%20Guy">Rosa Guy</a>, and Caribbean writer <a href="Paule%20Marshall">Paule Marshall</a>, who would eventually make significant contributions to African-American literature. Angelou dedicates herself to improving her craft, forcing herself to understand the technical aspects of writing. Lupton writes, "Readers can actually envision in this volume the distinguished artist who becomes the Maya Angelou of the 1990s".

Motherhood, a theme throughout Angelou's autobiographies, becomes more complex in "The Heart of a Woman". Although Guy struggles with the developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes a major part of her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him at the end of her previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.

Lupton also writes that motherhood is important in Angelou's books, as is "the motif of the responsible mother". Angelou's commitment to caring for her son is revealed in her confrontation with the street gang leader who has threatened Guy. In this episode, which Lupton considers the most dramatic in the book, Angelou has become a powerful mother. Angelou is no longer torn by self-doubt, but is now a strong and aggressive Black mother. Angelou has become what Joanne M. Braxton calls the "outraged mother", which represents the Black mother's strength and dedication found throughout slave narratives. Lupton also writes that Angelou has become a reincarnation of her grandmother, a central figure in "Caged Bird".

By the end of "The Heart of a Woman", Angelou is alone; for example, after Guy recuperates from the car accident, he leaves her to attend college. The final word in the book is the negative "myself", a word that signifies Angelou's new-found freedom and independence. Angelou has become truly herself and is no longer defined as someone's wife or mother. Scholar Wallis Tinnie calls this moment one of "illusive transcendence" and "a scene of hope and completion". For the first time in many years, Angelou will be able to eat a chicken breast alone, something that is valued throughout her books. Lupton calls this thought "perfectly formed". Tinnie states that "The Heart of a Woman's" "lonely aching" hearkens back to the poem that inspired the book's title.

Critics gave "The Heart of a Woman" positive reviews, praising its professional qualities. The <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>'s "" magazine says that although "Caged Bird" was the best of Angelou's autobiographies, "every book since has been very much worth the reading and pondering". Janet B. Blundell writes that the book was "lively, revealing, and worth the reading", but also found it "too chatty and anecdotal". Hagen responded to this criticism by stating that all of Angelou's books consist of episodes connected by theme and character. Sheree Crute, writing for "<a href="Ms.%20%28magazine%29">Ms.</a>", appreciated the episodic nature of Angelou's writing and praised her for her "wonderfully unaffected story telling skills". Cudjoe called it "the most political segment of Angelou's autobiographical statement".

In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">inauguration</a>; in the following week, sales of her works, including "The Heart of a Woman", rose by 300–600 percent. <a href="Bantam%20Books">Bantam Books</a> printed 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand. <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>, which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase. In 1997, Angelou's friend <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> named "The Heart of a Woman" as a selection in her <a href="Oprah%27s%20Book%20Club">book club</a>, making it a bestseller and increasing its total printing to over one million copies, sixteen years after its publication.

Choiseul pigeon

The Choiseul pigeon ("Microgoura meeki") is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> species of <a href="bird">bird</a> in the pigeon and dove family, <a href="Columbidae">Columbidae</a>. It was <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Choiseul%20Island">Choiseul</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, although there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.

The Choiseul pigeon was <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> within the genus Microgoura and had no known subspecies. Its closest living relative is believed to be the <a href="thick-billed%20ground%20pigeon">thick-billed ground pigeon</a>, and some authors have suggested that the Choiseul pigeon may be a link between that species and the <a href="crowned%20pigeon">crowned pigeon</a>s. The adult pigeon was largely blue-grey, with a buffy orange belly and a distinctive slaty-blue crest. It is unknown how this crest was held by the bird in life. The bird's head sported a blue <a href="frontal%20shield">frontal shield</a> surrounded by black feathers and a bicoloured beak. The wings were brown and the short tail was a blackish purple. It was described as having a beautiful rising and falling whistling call.

As the bird became extinct before significant field observations could be made, not much is known about its behaviour. It is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s. It was only recorded by <a href="Albert%20Stewart%20Meek">Albert Stewart Meek</a>, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It is believed to have been rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.

The Choiseul pigeon was described by <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> in 1904 on the basis of six skins—three male and three female—and an egg collected by <a href="Albert%20Stewart%20Meek">Albert Stewart Meek</a> earlier that year. It was placed in the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus "Microgoura", whose name comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word "mikros" "small", and "goura", a <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>n aboriginal name for the similarly-crested <a href="crowned%20pigeon">crowned pigeon</a>s of the genus "Goura". Rothschild named the species after Meek, giving the bird the specific name "meeki". Though its relationships are unclear, the Choiseul pigeon is believed to have been closest to the <a href="thick-billed%20ground%20pigeon">thick-billed ground pigeon</a> ("Trugon terrestris") from <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, which has similar plumage. It has been suggested that the Choiseul pigeon was a link between the thick-billed ground pigeon and the crowned pigeons; however, other sources argue that it may not have been closely related to the crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the Choiseul pigeon should be placed in the <a href="Gourinae">Gourinae</a> subfamily along with the "Groura" pigeons, the <a href="dodo">dodo</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>, and others. The Choiseul pigeon has no known subspecies.

Today, five skins and a partial skeleton are kept in the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, while a single skin and the egg are kept at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20at%20Tring">Natural History Museum at Tring</a>. The Choiseul pigeon is also known as the Solomon crowned pigeon, Solomon Islands pigeon, Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crested pigeon, Choiseul crested pigeon, crested Choiseul pigeon, Meek's pigeon, Meek's ground pigeon, and dwarf goura. The indigenous peoples of Choiseul called the species either "kumku-peka" or "kukuru-ni-lua", which translates literally as "pigeon-belong-ground".

The Choiseul pigeon was about long. The wing of the male was , the tail , the <a href="culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> , and the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> was . The wing of the female was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . Adult Choiseul pigeons of both sexes were blue-grey overall with a buffy orange belly. The pigeon had a distinctive long, rounded crest that had a hairy texture. This crest, like the crown, was slaty-blue and emerged from the bird's hindcrown. Though many artists have speculated, it is unknown how the pigeon held its crest in life as Meek's notes did not cover this subject. <a href="John%20Gerrard%20Keulemans">John Gerrard Keulemans</a> (who produced the illustration accompanying Rothschild's original description), depicted the crest as being flat based on Meek's specimens; other artists have presented it as spread and scraggly like that of the crowned pigeons. It has been suggested that the crests of the museum specimens were flattened during preparation.

On the bird's forehead was a naked and pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This was surrounded by short, velvety black feathers that extended from the base of the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and <a href="Covert%20feather%23Tail%20coverts">undertail-coverts</a> were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper <a href="mandible">mandible</a> was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> was a dark brown.

The bird's voice was never recorded; however, after it became extinct, the indigenous peoples described it as possessing a "beautiful rising and falling whistling call given from the roost site every evening." Others described the call as a low "c-r-r-ooo", "cr-ooo", or "cr-o-o-o".

Not much is known about the species' behaviour, as it became extinct before significant field observations could be made. It is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was a largely terrestrial species, feeding and nesting near the forest floor. The indigenous people of the town of Vundutura said that the pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to the ground. They claimed that the species was very tame, allowing local hunters to approach it and pick it up off of its perch by hand. They reported that the species had <a href="Gastrolith">stones</a> in its <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a>. It laid a single dark, cream-coloured egg in an unlined depression on the ground. The egg was about in size, which is considered small in proportion to the bird.

The Choiseul pigeon was <a href="Bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> and is thought to have lived on the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Choiseul%20Island">Choiseul</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near <a href="Choiseul%20Bay">Choiseul Bay</a> in the northern part of the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of <a href="Santa%20Isabel%20Island">Santa Isabel</a> and <a href="Malaita">Malaita</a>, and it is suspected that it may once have lived on <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville Island</a>. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.

In January 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but did not find any evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.

The Choiseul pigeon was not searched for again until briefly in 1927 and again in October 1929, when five veteran collectors belonging to the <a href="Whitney%20South%20Seas%20Expedition">Whitney South Seas Expedition</a> dedicated three months to searching for the pigeon in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the pigeon was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near <a href="Sasamungga">Sasamungga</a> by the <a href="Kolombangara%20River">Kolombangara River</a>, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of <a href="Rob%20Roy%20Island">Rob Roy Island</a> and <a href="Vaghena%20Island">Wagina</a> off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist <a href="Shane%20A.%20Parker">Shane A. Parker</a> did not discover any signs of the pigeon. American scientist <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> searched for the bird in 1974 without success.

This pigeon was a source of food for the local people, who would locate its roosting sites either due to the bird calling or by the droppings that had accumulated below its perches. It was well-remembered by the indigenous peoples, and stories of the delicious ground-dwelling pigeon were passed down by local elders after its extinction. One indigenous person implied that the gizzard stones of the pigeon may have had value locally. After the bird's extinction, the indigenous people have occasionally confused the Choiseul pigeon with the arboreal <a href="crested%20cuckoo-dove">crested cuckoo-dove</a> in modern folklore, and several claims of the pigeon's continued existence turned out to be based on the cuckoo-dove. After its discovery, several Western <a href="bird%20collections">bird collections</a> highly desired its skins; the Whitney South Seas Expedition spent three months at high expense on Choiseul with the primary objective being the acquisition of the Choiseul pigeon. In 2012 the Choiseul pigeon was commemorated on a stamp from <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> along with several other extinct birds. The Choiseul pigeon is depicted on the flag of the <a href="Choiseul%20Province">Choiseul Province</a>.

The indigenous population believed that the pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, it is believed that the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> has declared it <a href="extinct">extinct</a>. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, it is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.

Low captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently <a href="torture">torturing</a> his victims before murdering them.

Sir <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> described Low as "savage and desperate," and a man of "amazing and grotesque brutality". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called him a torturer, whose methods would have "done credit to the ingenuity of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> in its darkest days". The circumstances of Low's death, which took place around 1724, have been the subject of much speculation.

According to <a href="Captain%20Charles%20Johnson">Charles Johnson's</a> "<a href="A%20General%20History%20of%20the%20Pyrates">A General History of the Pyrates</a>", Edward Low was born in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, in 1690.
He was described as <a href="illiteracy">illiterate</a>, having a "quarrelsome nature", and always ready to cheat,
running "wild in the streets of his native parish".
As a young man, he was said to be a <a href="pickpocket">pickpocket</a> and gambler, playing games of chance with the <a href="footman">footmen</a> of the nearby <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>.

Most of his family appear to have been thieves. While young, his brother, Richard, was small for his age and is said to have been carried around in a basket on a friend's back; in a crowd, Richard would snatch the hats and <a href="wig">wig</a>s of passers-by. Richard later took to other forms of criminal activity and ended up <a href="hanging">hanged</a> at <a href="Tyburn">Tyburn</a> in 1707 for the <a href="burglary">burglary</a> of a house in <a href="Stepney">Stepney</a>.

As he grew older, Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery and turned to <a href="burglary">burglary</a>. Eventually, he left England, and traveled alone to the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> around 1710. He spent three to four years in various locations, before settling in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts</a>. On 12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of Boston. They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719.

Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low with his daughter. The loss of his wife had a profound effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to <a href="press-gang">press-gang</a> married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a <a href="Rigging">rigger</a>, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> headed for <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a>, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.

Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. One day, he returned to the ship when hungry, but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of <a href="rum">rum</a>. At this, Low "took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot another poor fellow through the throat".

Following this failed <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a>, Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day later, Low led the twelve-man gang—which included <a href="Francis%20Spriggs">Francis Farrington Spriggs</a>, who went on to become a notorious pirate in his own right—in taking over a small sloop off the coast of <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a>. Killing one man during the theft, Low and his crew turned pirate, determined "to go in her, make a black Flag, and declare War against all the World."

Low, using his newly captured ship, lay in wait on the popular shipping route between Boston and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed <a href="cargo%20ship">merchantmen</a> near Port Rosemary.

Low headed south and began operating in the waters of <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Grand Cayman</a>, with a period as <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> to the established pirate <a href="George%20Lowther%20%28pirate%29">George Lowther</a>, who captained the "Happy Delivery", a 100-<a href="long%20ton">ton</a> Rhode Island sloop with eight <a href="cannon">cannon</a> and ten swivel guns. When she was "destroyed by Indians", Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the "Ranger". Lowther's crew was constantly expanded by desperate sailors willing to join him. Fast acquiring a taste for cruelty, Low taught Spriggs a <a href="torture">torture</a> technique which involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down to the bones.

Following a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captured a large 6-gun <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a> (named "Rebecca") on 28 May 1722. He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther.

In one notable raid in June 1722, Low and his crew attacked thirteen <a href="New%20England">New England</a> fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway, <a href="Shelburne%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Shelburne</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. Although outnumbered, Low hoisted his <a href="Jolly%20Roger">Jolly Roger</a> flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the fishermen if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed every vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-ton <a href="schooner">schooner</a> which he renamed "The Fancy" and armed with 10 guns, to become his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. He sank the other ships of the fleet, and abandoned the "Rebecca". 

"<a href="The%20Boston%20News-Letter">The Boston News-Letter</a>" of 9 July 1722 published a list of those captured by Low. A number of the fishermen were forced to join Low, including <a href="Philip%20Ashton">Philip Ashton</a>, who escaped in May 1723 on <a href="Roat%C3%A1n">Roatán</a> Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and who wrote a detailed account of life aboard Low's pirate ship. Before Ashton's escape, he had been beaten, whipped, kept in chains, and threatened with death many times - particularly by Low's quartermaster <a href="John%20Russell%20%28pirate%29">John Russell</a> - as he refused to sign Low's <a href="Pirate%20code%20of%20the%20Brethren">articles</a> and become a pirate.

Low's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting <a href="false%20colours">false colours</a> and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off the coast of <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St John's</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, Low mistook a fully armed <a href="man-of-war">man-of-war</a> for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to <a href="Conception%20Bay">Conception Bay</a>, capturing a number of boats around the <a href="Grand%20Banks">Grand Banks</a> southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. There, he captured a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French</a> (or <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese</a>—sources differ) <a href="pink%20%28ship%29">pink</a>, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the "Rose Pink". He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the <a href="Yard%20%28sailing%29">yard arm</a> several times, until they died. He moved on to the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canaries</a>, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> and then back across to the coast of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, where he was driven back by foul weather.

Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. George Roberts, a mate on the British ship "King Sagamore", recounted a meeting with Low aboard the "Rose Pink". Roberts' ship was captured by Low's fleet, of which he was now styling himself "Commodore".

Forty <a href="League%20%28unit%29">leagues</a> (120 nautical miles or around 220 km) to the east of <a href="Surinam">Surinam</a>, Low and his fleet of two ships (the "Rose Pink" and the "Fancy", captained by a young <a href="Charles%20Harris%20%28pirate%29">Charles Harris</a>) dropped anchor to remove growth such as <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> and <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s from the outside of the boats, in a process known as <a href="careening">careening</a>, necessary because no <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> was available to pirates.

Still relatively inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the "Rose Pink" tipped over too far. The <a href="porthole">porthole</a>s had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The "Rose Pink" had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, the "Squirrel"—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a <a href="pint">pint</a> (around 275 <a href="litre">ml</a>) per man, per day.

Failing to reach their initial destination of <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a> due to light winds and strong <a href="Ocean%20current">currents</a>, Low's depleted fleet made it to <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the "Ranger"), gave the schooner "Squirrel" to Spriggs, now his <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>, who renamed it the "Delight" before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.

Low's new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the "Fortune". During a trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low's crew, a sailor on board the "Fortune" named John Welland recalled how Low stripped his boat, including gold to the value of <a href="GBP">£</a>150, then beat him and cut off his ear with a <a href="cutlass">cutlass</a>.

Following this, Low's fleet captured a Portuguese ship called the "Nostra Signiora de Victoria" on 25 January 1723. The "Victoria's" captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold <a href="moidore">moidore</a>s (worth at the time around £15,000) to fall into the sea rather than see it captured. One of Low's most noted episodes of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's lips with a cutlass, <a href="broiling">broiled</a> them, and forced the victim to eat them while still hot. He then murdered the remaining crew. Low's own men described him as "a maniac and a brute".

One story describes Low burning a French cook alive, saying he was a "greasy fellow who would fry well", and another tells he once killed 53 <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> captives with his cutlass. Some historians, including <a href="David%20Cordingly">David Cordingly</a>, believe this was deliberately done to cultivate a ferocious image. Historian Edward Leslie described Low as a <a href="psychopath">psychopath</a> with a history filled with "mutilations, <a href="disembowelment">disembowelings</a>, <a href="decapitation">decapitation</a>s, and slaughter".

Low, like other pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into surrendering by threatening to kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of <a href="reprisal">reprisal</a>s. One failed <a href="torture">torture</a> session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.

A <a href="snow%20%28ship%29">snow</a> called the "Unity" was added to the fleet, and used as a <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a>, but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war named the "Mermaid". As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.

Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the <a href="Carolinas">Carolinas</a>. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a <a href="Action%20of%2010%20June%201723">battle</a> with , a heavily armed man of war. "Greyhound" had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the "Fancy" with a <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the "Ranger" behind.

Twenty-five of the crew of the "Ranger", including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July, with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle. The men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a>, Rhode Island, on 19 July 1723. Harris was sent back to England and hanged at <a href="Execution%20Dock">Execution Dock</a> in <a href="Wapping">Wapping</a>. When Solgard returned to New York, he was presented with the <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20city">freedom of the city</a> and a gold <a href="Decorative%20boxes%23Snuff%20box">snuffbox</a> for his part in bringing some of Low's crew to justice.

Low, still captaining the "Fancy", sailed north. He captured a <a href="whaling">whaling</a> vessel 80 miles (130 km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the encounter with the "Greyhound" and the loss of Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached <a href="Nantucket%2C%20Massachusetts">Nantucket</a>, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, Low's crew took a fishing boat near <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a>. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.

Heading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>n merchant vessel, the "Merry Christmas", in late June 1723. Following the defeat by the "Greyhound", Low became "peculiarly cruel" to his English victims. His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with George Lowther in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the "Delight" off the coast of <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, mounting fourteen guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the "Merry Christmas", by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.

There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Low's death. Captain Charles Johnsonconsidered by some to be <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> writing under a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>—stated in his "A General History of the Pyrates", at odds with other sources, that Low and the "Fancy" were last sighted near the Canaries and Guinea. However, at the time of his 1724 book, no further reports had surfaced. He noted one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands. The <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> in London states that he was never caught, ending his days in Brazil.

"The Pirates Own Book" and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift without provisions by the crew of the "Merry Christmas", in a <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. His crew elected <a href="Captain%20Shipton">Captain Shipton</a> to command the "Merry Christmas"; they would go on to sail alongside Spriggs in the Caribbean. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> in 1724.

Initially, Low used the same flag as <a href="Edward%20Teach">Edward Teach</a> ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red <a href="skeleton">skeletal figure</a> on a black background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this "Green Trumpeter" was hoisted on the <a href="mizzen">mizzen</a> peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.

Low had a set of Articles, a <a href="code%20of%20conduct">code of conduct</a> and an ironic reference to the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s own <a href="Articles%20of%20War%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Articles of War</a>. The Articles listed below are attributed to Low by "The Boston News-Letter". The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to Lowther by Charles Johnson.

It is likely that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an "<a href="ordonnance">ordonnance</a>", or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.

Edward Low's acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such as <a href="Blackbeard">Edward "Blackbeard" Teach</a>, <a href="Bartholomew%20Roberts">Bartholomew "Black Bart" Roberts</a>, and <a href="William%20Fly">William Fly</a>, led to a great increase in the military presence to protect shipping lanes, resulting in the effective end of the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Piracy">Golden Age of Piracy</a>.

By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal, following the end of a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s. <a href="Piracy%20in%20the%20Caribbean">Pirates based in the Caribbean</a> were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at <a href="Port%20Royal">Port Royal</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the <a href="Spanish%20Main">Spanish Main</a>, known as the "Guarda de Costa", or simply the "Guarda".

Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and <a href="Stede%20Bonnet">Stede Bonnet</a>. <a href="Howard%20Pyle">Howard Pyle</a>, in an 1880 children's book on pirates, said: "No one stood higher in the trade than [Low], and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written and sung of this man of might, for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard." Sir <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, in his work "The Green Flag", described Low as "savage and desperate", and a man of "amazing and grotesque brutality". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said "Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic, and his depredations were committed on every part of the ocean, from the coast of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland".
Low has featured on stamps and commemorative currency around the Caribbean. A <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> featuring Low was <a href="List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20the%20Cayman%20Islands">commissioned</a> by the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a> in 1975, and in 1994 the government of <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a> featured Low and his brigantine, "Rebecca", on a legal tender one hundred-<a href="East%20Caribbean%20dollar">dollar</a> bill made of <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a>.

"Ned Low" is one of the pirates featured on the <a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28theme%20park%20ride%29">Pirates of the Caribbean ride</a> at the <a href="Disneyland%20Park%20%28Anaheim%29">Disneyland</a> theme park in <a href="California">California</a>. A duplicate of Low's flag was used for the flag of the fictional pirate <a href="Sao%20Feng">Sao Feng</a> in Disney's <a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">"Pirates of the Caribbean" films</a>. Ned Low was played by Tadhg Murphy in the <a href="Starz%20%28TV%20channel%29">Starz</a> TV series "<a href="Black%20Sails%20%28TV%20series%29">Black Sails</a>".

Some of Low's haunts, such as the waters around the <a href="Isles%20of%20Shoals">Isles of Shoals</a> off <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> and Isle Haute in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, attract <a href="treasure%20hunter">treasure hunter</a>s who seek artifacts in the ships he sank.

Elizabeth Margaret Braddock ("née" Bamber; 24 September 1899 – 13 November 1970) was a British <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> politician who served as <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for the <a href="Liverpool%20Exchange%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liverpool Exchange</a> division from 1945 to 1970. She was a member of <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council">Liverpool County Borough Council</a> from 1930 to 1961. Although she never held office in government, she won a national reputation for her forthright campaigns in connection with <a href="Housing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">housing</a>, <a href="public%20health">public health</a> and other <a href="social%20issue">social issue</a>s.

Braddock inherited much of her campaigning spirit from her mother, <a href="Mary%20Bamber">Mary Bamber</a>, an early <a href="History%20of%20the%20socialist%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">socialist</a> and <a href="Trade%20unions%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">trade union</a> activist. After some years in the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP), Braddock joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB) on its foundation in 1920, but quickly became disillusioned with the party's dictatorial tendencies. She left the CPGB in 1924 and later joined the Labour Party. Before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, alongside her husband Jack Braddock she established a reputation as a crusading <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> <a href="councillor">councillor</a>, frequently at odds with her party while pursuing an agenda of social reform. During the war she worked in Liverpool's ambulance service, before winning the Exchange division for Labour in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>.

With her formidable physique and outspoken manner, Braddock was a pugnacious presence in parliament, and a keen supporter of the 1945–51 <a href="Attlee%20ministry">Attlee ministry</a>'s reform agenda, particularly the establishment of the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a> in 1948. She served on Labour's <a href="National%20Executive%20Committee">National Executive Committee</a> between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952. For most of her parliamentary career she remained a member of Liverpool's council, and was a central figure in the controversy that arose in the 1950s over the city's decision to acquire and flood the <a href="Tryweryn%20Valley">Tryweryn Valley</a> in <a href="Wales">Wales</a> for the construction of a reservoir.

Between 1953 and 1957 Braddock served on the Royal Commission for Mental Health which led to the <a href="Mental%20Health%20Act%201959">Mental Health Act 1959</a>. From the early 1950s she moved steadily to the right wing of her party, and was increasingly acerbic in her judgements of her former colleagues on the left. When Labour won the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">1964 general election</a> she refused office on the grounds of age and health; thereafter her parliamentary contributions dwindled as her health worsened. Towards the end of her life she became Liverpool's first woman <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">freeman</a>. After her death in 1970 her "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" obituarist hailed her as "one of the most distinctive political personalities of the century".

Elizabeth Bamber was born on 24 September 1899 at 23 Zante Street, in the <a href="Everton%2C%20Liverpool">Everton</a> area of <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, the eldest daughter of Hugh Bamber, a bookbinder, and his wife Mary, "née" Little. Mary had come to Liverpool as a child when her father, a well-to-do Edinburgh lawyer, abandoned his family after his descent into alcoholism and poverty. Liverpool in the late 19th century suffered extremes of deprivation, and had the highest <a href="infant%20mortality">infant mortality</a> rate in the country. Mary became a trade union organiser and campaigner against deplorable social conditions, and established a reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. She was the dominant early influence on her daughter Elizabeth, who formed a lifelong determination to represent and fight for the disadvantaged.

In 1902 the Bamber family relocated to Smollett Street in nearby <a href="Bootle">Bootle</a>, one of several moves that caused Elizabeth's formal education to be divided among different schools. Alongside her normal schooling, her political education began at the Marmaduke Street <a href="Socialist%20Sunday%20Schools">Socialist Sunday School</a>, and through the medium of her mother's campaigning activities. One of Elizabeth's early memories was of the <a href="soup%20kitchen">soup kitchen</a> for the destitute which Mary helped to run on <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hall%2C%20Liverpool">St George's Plateau</a>: "I remember the faces of the unemployed when the soup ran out ... I remember blank, hopeless stares, day after day, week after week, all through the hard winter of 1906–07".

At the age of eleven Elizabeth left the Sunday School and joined the youth section of the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP), where she studied <a href="socialism">socialism</a> alongside a busy programme of social activities. She later described herself at this time as "strong, agile, fond of walking and eating". By this time Mary Bamber was working as an organiser for the <a href="National%20Amalgamated%20Union%20of%20Shop%20Assistants%2C%20Warehousemen%20and%20Clerks">Warehouse Workers' Union</a>; Elizabeth assisted her mother, sometimes acting as a steward at meetings. Mother and daughter were both present at St George's Plateau on 13 August 1911, when a baton charge by police and troops broke up a rally in support of Liverpool's striking transport workers. Hundreds were injured, and in the disturbances that followed, two demonstrators were shot dead. The day became enshrined in Liverpool's working-class history as "<a href="1911%20Liverpool%20general%20transport%20strike">Bloody Sunday</a>".

Elizabeth left school in 1913, and began work filling seed packets for five <a href="shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a>s a week. The job was too monotonous to engage her for long, and after a few months she found a post in the drapery department of the Walton Road <a href="The%20Co-operative%20Group">Co-operative store</a>. At her mother's insistence she became a member of the <a href="Union%20of%20Shop%2C%20Distributive%20and%20Allied%20Workers">Shopworkers' Union</a>. Meanwhile, she attended classes run by the <a href="Workers%27%20Educational%20Association">Workers' Educational Association</a> and the <a href="Plebs%27%20League">Plebs' League</a>: "They told me how the capitalists controlled money, business and the land, and ... hung on to them".

Within the group of young socialists who gathered regularly at the ILP's local headquarters, there were three Elizabeths. To avoid confusion, lots were drawn to decide who should be known respectively as Elizabeth, Betty, or Bessie. By this means Elizabeth Bamber took the name Bessie, which she retained for the rest of her life. Among the other ILP activists at Kensington was <a href="Sydney%20Silverman">Sydney Silverman</a>, four years older than Bessie, the son of a poor draper. Silverman was a considerable influence on the youthful Bessie; he would be her future colleague, both in the Liverpool council chamber and the House of Commons. When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began in August 1914, the ILP <a href="Opposition%20to%20World%20War%20I">opposed it</a> as "an appalling crime upon the nations" who had been "stampeded by fear and panic". On the introduction of <a href="Military%20Service%20Act%201916">conscription</a> in 1916, Silverman and others adopted positions of uncompromising pacifism, and were imprisoned. The ILP welcomed news of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917, and vigorously opposed <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">allied intervention</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> that followed it. Bessie played a leading role in a <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">TUC</a> "<a href="Hands%20Off%20Russia">Hands Off Russia</a>" rally in Liverpool's Sheil Park, where she and others resisted the efforts of the <a href="British%20Empire%20Union">British Empire Union</a> to capture the ILP's red flag.

At the end of the war in 1918, Bessie left the Co-op and took a clerical post with the Warehouse Workers' Union. In the course of her ILP activities she had met and befriended John "Jack" Braddock, a wagon builder and union activist with a reputation as a firebrand. He had arrived in Liverpool from <a href="Dewsbury">Dewsbury</a> in 1915, hoping to emigrate to Canada, but had stayed in the port and immersed himself in left-wing politics and the fight to improve working conditions. He and Bessie became very close; in 1919 they helped Mary Bamber to fight for a Liverpool council seat, as the ILP's candidate in the <a href="Everton%20%28ward%29">Everton</a> district. The election campaign was bitter and at times violent, but resulted in Bamber's victory by the slim margin of 13 votes.

By 1920 Mary Bamber, Bessie and Jack Braddock had become disillusioned with the ILP, which seemed to them to lack the necessary radicalism to march with the times. At the time, <a href="Sylvia%20Pankhurst">Sylvia Pankhurst</a>'s <a href="Workers%27%20Socialist%20Federation">Workers' Socialist Federation</a>, the <a href="British%20Socialist%20Party">British Socialist Party</a> and other socialist organisations were increasingly coordinating their activities, and in 1920 merged to form the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB). Under Mary Bamber's influence, both Bessie and Jack Braddock left the ILP to become members of the new party. Within the CPGB the young couple became acquainted with <a href="Wal%20Hannington">Wal Hannington</a>, leader of the <a href="National%20Unemployed%20Workers%20Committee%20Movement">National Unemployed Workers Committee Movement</a>. They joined his "work or maintenance" campaign which aimed to raise the levels of <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201834">Poor Law relief</a> to what they considered a proper subsistence level. The couple did not endear themselves to the CPGB hierarchy when, on egalitarian grounds, they opposed the levels of salary which the party wanted to pay to its full-time officials.

In the joint autobiography written with Jack, "The Braddocks" (1963), Bessie cites the formative experience of police violence on <a href="1911%20Liverpool%20general%20transport%20strike">"Bloody Sunday" in 1911</a> as a motivating factor for her CPGB activities. On 12 September 1921, again at St George's Plateau, she attended a rally for the city's jobless, organised by the Liverpool Unemployed Workers' Committee. Again there was police intervention; Jack and Mary Bamber were charged with unlawful assembly and received a token one day's imprisonment. In 1922 Bessie and other party members provided comfort and shelter to Hannington's <a href="hunger%20marches">hunger marchers</a>, as the columns of unemployed passed through Lancashire on their way to London. Bessie combined her party roles—she was treasurer of the Liverpool branch—with her full-time union post; Jack, meanwhile, was only intermittently in work, as his incendiary reputation meant that employers were reluctant to give him a job. He had been living for some time at the Bambers' home when, in February 1922, the couple were married at Brougham Terrace registry office, during the course of a working day. After a brief reception they returned to their respective duties—Bessie to her union job and Jack to his volunteer work for the CPGB.

The Braddocks were not comfortable as CPGB members. They objected to the lack of autonomy afforded to local branches by the party's central "Political Bureau", and to what they perceived as the leadership's unquestioning subservience to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Mary Bamber, after a visit to Russia, opined that there were as many true communists in Liverpool as in Moscow. In 1924, increasingly convinced that communist rule would lead to the enslavement rather than the liberation of workers, the entire leadership of the Liverpool CPGB branch, including both Braddocks, resigned from the party.

After leaving the CPGB, the Braddocks continued their socialist activism in Liverpool. Jack's role in the Merseyside Council of Action (an impromptu militant action group) during the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">1926 General Strike</a> made employers even less willing to engage him. He was rescued by the action of Sir Benjamin Johnson, a liberal-minded industrialist, who lent him the money to purchase a <a href="Co-operative%20Insurance%20Society">Co-operative Insurance Society</a> agency. Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the <a href="Kensington%20and%20Fairfield%20%28ward%29">Fairfield</a> ward of the Liverpool Labour Party. In the <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council%20election%2C%201929">1929 Liverpool council elections</a>, Jack was returned unopposed as the Labour councillor for the Fairfield ward. <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council%20election%2C%201930">A year later</a> Bessie joined him, elected in the <a href="St.%20Anne%20Street%20%28Liverpool%20ward%29">St Anne's</a> ward.

St Anne's, one of the most deprived areas of the city, contained a closed <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> at Brownlow Hill, which the Conservative-controlled council had decided to sell to the Roman Catholic Church as the potential site for a cathedral. The Labour group's official policy was to delay the sale for several years, so that the empty workhouse buildings could be used as temporary housing during <a href="slum%20clearance">slum clearance</a> and rebuilding. The issue split Labour on religious lines; nearly all the Catholic members of the Labour group defied party policy and voted for an immediate sale. Among the rebels was the sitting St Anne's councillor, Olive Hughes. She was thereupon deselected by the St Anne's ward, which chose Bessie as their candidate for the 1930 election. Bessie faced a difficult task, since Hughes chose to stand against her as an Independent Socialist, with the support of leading local Catholics in a ward where the electorate was 85 per cent Catholic. An intense campaign, during which Bessie claimed to have visited every street in the ward, brought her success.

This victory did not delay the workhouse's fate; the site was duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and demolition began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As a member of the council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and <a href="child%20protection">child welfare</a> issues.

The Labour group on the council remained divided. The group's leader was Luke Hogan (1885–1954), of Irish stock and closely identified with the Catholic caucus. He enjoyed the strong support of around two-thirds of the Labour councillors; the Braddocks, and from 1932 Sydney Silverman, were part of the smaller leftist wing of the group. Clashes between the two sides were frequent, the main contention being the supposed attempts by Hogan and his followers to "catholicise" the local party. When in 1936 Hogan tried to block the renewal of a grant to a local birth control clinic, Bessie led a cross-party rebellion of councillors which ensured that the grant was maintained. She argued that most of the 87 women who had died in childbirth the previous year might have survived with access to contraception.

Mostly, Bessie was uncompromising in her attitude towards the council's ruling Conservatives; on one occasion she was ejected from the council chamber by the police, after she had called the Housing Committee chairman a liar and refused the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Liverpool">mayor</a>'s order to withdraw the remark. She justified this behaviour on the grounds that "if you didn't do something outrageous, nobody would take any notice of you". She had earlier resorted to using a two-foot <a href="megaphone">megaphone</a> in a council meeting, to demand action over housing conditions and slums.

Inspired by her colleague Silverman, who in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 general election</a> became <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">MP</a> for <a href="Nelson%20and%20Colne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Nelson and Colne</a>, Bessie determined to seek a parliamentary career of her own. This ambition contrasted with that of Jack, who turned down the chance to be Labour's candidate in the <a href="Liverpool%20Everton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Everton constituency</a> to concentrate on his local government role. In 1936 Bessie was selected as Labour candidate for <a href="Liverpool%20Exchange%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Liverpool Exchange</a>. This inner-city division had long been held by the Conservatives, mainly because of a substantial "business vote" which, before the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201948">abolition</a> of <a href="plural%20voting">plural voting</a> in 1948, gave owners of businesses an extra vote in the constituency where their business operated. In the recent election the seat had been held by the Conservative, <a href="John%20Shute%20%28politician%29">Sir John Shute</a>, with a majority of 4,412. Bessie was then 36 years old; she would have to wait for nearly 10 years before she could fight her seat, as the general election that would normally have been held in 1939 or 1940 was postponed by the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

In the years immediately before the war Bessie was concerned at the extent of recruitment in the city by the <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>. She was outspoken in her attacks on fascist groups, and in her defence of those who attacked their parades. The death of her mother Mary Bamber in June 1938, at the age of 63, was a considerable personal blow to Bessie, and was widely mourned within Liverpool's socialist community.

On the outbreak of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3 May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost until the end of the war in 1945.

In 1942 Bessie and Jack moved to what would be their home for the remainder of their lives, a suburban semi-detached house in ZigZag Road, in Liverpool's <a href="West%20Derby">West Derby</a> district. They remained active members of Liverpool council, and in 1943 Jack became deputy leader of the Labour group. Two years later the Braddocks healed the rift with Hogan by proposing and seconding his appointment as the city's <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Liverpool">Lord Mayor</a> for the year 1945–46; Jack succeeded him as leader of the Labour group on the council, a post he held until his death in 1963. Bessie became honorary president of the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party (LTCLP), the body that had been formed in 1921 when the Liverpool Trades Council merged with the newly formed local Labour Party to form a united labour front.

Despite some opinion polls indicating a Labour lead, most commentators expected that <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s prestige would ensure a comfortable Conservative victory in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">July 1945 general election</a>. Before polling day, "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" surmised that "the chances of Labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority ... are pretty remote". The "News of the World" predicted a working Conservative majority, while in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> a pundit forecast the result as Conservatives 360, Labour 220, Others 60. The expectations of a Labour victory in Liverpool Exchange were not high, but Bessie's chances were boosted by the poor local record of the sitting member, Colonel Shute, and she herself was confident. Defying most forecasts, across the country Labour won 393 seats, and with an overall majority of 146, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> formed the first majority Labour government. Bessie won Liverpool Exchange with a majority of 665 from 16,000 votes cast.

In an assessment of the new MPs, the "Daily Express" described Bessie as "a character among the Labour women. Very forthright in her speech, strong in her Labour faith ... never hesitates to call a spade a spade". Physically imposing—she admitted to weighing 15 stone (210 pounds, 95 kg)—she made an impact with her <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> on 17 October 1945, during a debate on the national housing shortage. After taunting the Conservative opposition by claiming to have "filched" the Exchange seat—"the prize Division of the [Liverpool] Tory Party"—she made an impassioned plea to the new <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Minister of Health</a>, <a href="Aneurin%20Bevan">Aneurin Bevan</a>, for immediate measures to improve the slum housing conditions in Liverpool, and throughout the country: "Particularly in industrial areas, people are living in flea-ridden, bug-ridden, rat-ridden, lousy hell-holes". She ended her speech with a promise that she and other Labour <a href="back-bencher">back-bencher</a>s would continue to agitate until the conditions in which many were forced to live, "as a result of having been represented for so long by the Conservative Party", were removed.

Bessie's aggressive anti-Toryism was frequently in evidence during her first years in parliament, especially when she could attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28 March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the <a href="International%20Cotton%20Association">Liverpool Cotton Association</a>, which she denounced as "the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool", nothing more than a group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order to make profits for themselves. On 1 May 1947 "The Manchester Guardian", reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">nationalisation of the railways</a>, recorded that "Mrs E.M. Braddock ... danced a jig as she moved over to the Opposition benches where she occupied the seat usually used by Mr Churchill." When the "<a href="The%20Bolton%20News">Bolton Evening News</a>" called her performance "nauseating, a sorry degradation of democratic discussion" she sued the newspaper for defamation. She lost the case, and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful.

In 1947 Bessie was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC). At the time she was generally identified with the left wing of the party, and was associated with a grouping known as the "Socialist Fellowship", which espoused a programme of colonial freedom, workers' control and reduced arms expenditure. She resigned from the Fellowship in 1950, along with fellow-MPs <a href="Fenner%20Brockway">Fenner Brockway</a> and <a href="Ellis%20Smith">Ellis Smith</a>, when it condemned the <a href="Korean%20War%23United%20Nations%20response%20%28July%20%E2%80%93%20August%201950%29">United Nations intervention</a> in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. She continued her wholehearted campaigning on behalf of the poorest in the country, pleading with parliament to "remember the queues outside the Poor Relief offices", and castigating the <a href="Christian%20Dior%20S.A.%23The%20%26quot%3BNew%20Look%26quot%3B">"New Look"</a> fashion of 1948 as wasteful, "the ridiculous whim of idle people". Bessie's fiery reputation did not harm her electorally; in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201950">February 1950 general election</a>, with the Exchange constituency greatly increased by boundary changes, her majority rose to 5,344. Nationally, Labour lost 76 seats, and its parliamentary majority was reduced to five. Attlee's second government was short-lived; in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201951">October 1951 general election</a> Bessie increased her personal majority again, to 6,834, but nationally Labour was defeated by the Conservatives and went into opposition.

Outside her political duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary presidency of the Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague <a href="Edith%20Summerskill">Edith Summerskill</a>, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract "The Ignoble Art", and campaigned for the sport's abolition.

After leaving Socialist Fellowship, Bessie moved steadily towards the centre and right of her party, distancing herself from colleagues with whom she had earlier found common cause. She did not support Aneurin Bevan when he resigned from the government in April 1951 over the introduction of National Health Service charges, and later asserted that, by making dissidence fashionable, Bevan had "weakened the [Labour] National Executive to the point where it could no longer deal effectively with infiltrating <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyists</a> and Communists". In 1955 her opposition to the <a href="Bevanism">Bevanite faction</a> was such that she supported efforts by <a href="Hugh%20Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a> to have Bevan expelled from the party. She regularly attacked the Labour left at party conferences, and in 1952 was involved in scuffles with other delegates after the unexpected success of Bevanite candidates in the NEC elections.

Also in 1952, Bessie's volatile temperament caused her to become the first woman member to be suspended from the House of Commons, after she repeatedly protested to the Deputy Speaker for failing to call her during a debate on the textile industry, a matter of great concern to her constituents. In general, however, her forthright attitude won her cross-party respect, and in 1953 she was appointed by Churchill (who had returned as prime minister in 1951) to the Royal Commission on Mental Health, otherwise known as the Percy Commission, whose work led to the <a href="Mental%20Health%20Act%201959">Mental Health Act 1959</a>.

Bessie's increasingly centrist stance troubled party members in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down before the next general election. This was rejected by the NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201955">May 1955 general election</a> the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 to deselect her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations had no effect on Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26 May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council%20election%2C%201955">municipal elections</a> held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie gave up her St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted <a href="alderman">alderman</a>.

In May 1956 Bessie's concerns about the treatment of prisoners in <a href="HM%20Prison%20Liverpool">Walton Prison</a> led to an investigation by <a href="Godfrey%20Vick">Sir Godfrey Russell Vick</a>, which revealed numerous instances of violence by members of the prison staff, and brought about reforms. In July that year, during a home affairs debate, Bessie demanded tougher regulations on the supply and licensing of <a href="air%20gun">air pistols</a>, which under the existing law were readily available to juveniles. She alarmed the house by brandishing two such pistols which, she explained, she had confiscated in the course of her duties as a juvenile court magistrate. When rebuked by the Deputy Speaker, she replied that she had deliberately used shock tactics, reprising her earlier council chamber argument that "no one takes any notice unless someone does something which is out of order, or is unusual". She also campaigned for the rights of larger women to <a href="plus-size%20clothing">obtain fashionable clothes</a>; using her substantial 50" – 40" – 50" measurements to advantage, she took part in a fashion show aimed at the larger-than-average woman.

In 1956, as part of a Liverpool council delegation, the Braddocks visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the mayor of <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, a city with which Liverpool had informal fraternal links. Her overall impression of the country was of drabness and oppression, with welfare provision generally well below British levels, although she conceded that medical facilities were excellent. Before returning home she informed the mayor of Odessa that "after forty years of socialism ... you haven't achieved half of what we have in Britain".

In the later 1950s an issue arose which tarnished the reputations of both Braddocks in the eyes of much of Liverpool's <a href="Welsh%20people%23Welsh%20emigration">Welsh community</a> and the people of Wales. In 1955 Liverpool council applied for the compulsory purchase of land in the Tryweryn Valley, <a href="Merionethshire">Merionethshire</a>, North Wales, for the construction of a reservoir to serve Liverpool's increasing needs for water—some 65 million gallons a day. The proposal would mean the flooding of the small village of <a href="Capel%20Celyn">Capel Celyn</a>, and several farms. On 7 November a deputation led by the <a href="Plaid%20Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> president <a href="Gwynfor%20Evans">Gwynfor Evans</a> sought to address the council in a plea for a change in policy. According to Bessie's biographer Ben Rees, while Evans was speaking, Bessie banged on the table and joined other councillors in insulting Evans and demanding that he "go back to Wales". In July 1957, when the enabling legislation reached its <a href="Reading%20%28legislature%29%23Second%20reading">second House of Commons reading</a>, Bessie described the scheme as regional rather than local, and claimed that some parts of Wales would benefit from it. The land to be flooded in the Tryweryn Valley was not, she said, of high agricultural value, and "nothing was done that was not agreed to by the tenants in the area". The bill became law, and construction began in 1959, but protests and demonstrations continued until the reservoir's opening in 1965. The slogan "Cofio Treweryn" ("I Remember Tryweryn") was coined by nationalists, says Rees, as "a reminder of Liverpool's greed and lack of sensitivity". In October 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the reservoir's completion, protestors demonstrated around the statue of Bessie at <a href="Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station">Liverpool Lime Street station</a>.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201959">October 1959 general election</a> the Conservatives, now led by <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, increased their majority in parliament to 100 seats. In Liverpool Exchange Bessie defied the national swing, and increased her proportion of the vote. On a reduced turnout her personal majority fell slightly, to 6,971.

In 1961 Bessie's aldermanic term on Liverpool's council expired. That year, the Conservatives briefly took control of the council, and used their majority to block her reappointment. This ended 31 years' service on the council. In 1963, when Labour regained control, she did not seek re-instatement. The year 1963 saw the publication of "The Braddocks", in which Bessie made a sustained attack on communism and <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a>: "The purpose of this book is to bring home to the rank and file how wide that influence is ... unless positive steps are taken by the workers themselves ... democracy will be dead". Reviewing the book for the "Socialist Standard", Lawrence Weidberg thought it gave a useful picture of early 20th century working-class life in Liverpool, but concluded that "from the evidence of this book the Braddocks qualified fully for the role of blind leaders of the blind".

On 12 November 1963 Jack Braddock died of a heart attack at the age of 71, while attending an official function in Liverpool. The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">October 1964 general election</a> brought Labour a narrow victory under <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, while in Liverpool Exchange, Bessie achieved her best personal majority to date, 9,746. She did not take a post in the new government; according to "The Guardian" she was offered a job, but declined on the grounds of health and age. Although she fought the next election, in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201966">March 1966</a>, and held Liverpool Exchange easily, for the final six years of her parliamentary life she was relatively inactive and often absent through illness. Her last contribution in the House was on 27 January 1969, a question regarding facilities for disabled drivers.

In 1968 Bessie became vice chairman (and therefore chairman-elect) of the Labour Party. However, in February 1969 she collapsed with exhaustion and was hospitalised. In August she resigned from the NEC on health grounds, thus forgoing her succession to the party chairmanship. In September she announced that she did not intend to contest the next general election, and would retire from politics, a decision which shocked and disappointed her constituents. In April 1970 she was awarded the <a href="List%20of%20Freemen%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Liverpool">freedom of the City of Liverpool</a>, the first woman thus honoured. Bessie formally left parliament at the dissolution before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">June 1970 general election</a>; on 13 November 1970 she died in Liverpool's Rathbone Hospital, at the age of 71. At her funeral service held a few days later at <a href="Anfield%20Cemetery">Anfield Crematorium</a>, in the course of his tribute, Harold Wilson summed her up thus: "She was born to fight for the people of the docks, of the slums, of the factories and in every part of the city where people needed help".

At the time of her death, commentators described Bessie as one of the most notable political personalities of her time, and perhaps the best-known woman in Britain after <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. She was especially appreciated in Liverpool, where much of her campaigning zeal for better housing and healthcare was concentrated. Widely known and remembered as "Battling Bessie", thirty years after her death she was placed eighth in a BBC poll of "great Merseysiders".

Bessie was renowned for the sharpness of her tongue, either in pursuit of her campaigns or in denouncing her enemies. She frequently used inflammatory, colourful language, once describing an opposing councillor as a "blasted rat", and another time telling the Tory majority that she was willing "to take a machine gun to the lot of you". In contrast to this aggressive public, Bessie's private life was unostentatious. She did not smoke or drink, dressed conventionally and holidayed modestly in <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the company of many glamorous friends from the worlds of show business and boxing.

Towards perceived adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, especially those with whom she had once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: "My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to the columnist <a href="Simon%20Hoggart">Simon Hoggart</a>, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: "If it sounds true, if it echoes something we feel about the politician, then it will cling to him or her as if bonded with superglue".

In 1984, <a href="Radio%20City%20%28Liverpool%29">Radio City</a>, an independent Liverpool radio station, broadcast a 4-part dramatisation of Jack and Bessie Braddock's lives. Bessie Braddock is commemorated in Liverpool by the statue in Lime Street Station, and by a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> erected at her modest home in ZigZag Road. In a 2014 <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a> essay the Labour MP <a href="Lisa%20Nandy">Lisa Nandy</a> wrote that Bessie "brought her experiences of life in the slums of Liverpool right into the heart of Westminster. Now, more than ever, we need the voices of working women to be heard in parliament".

Mark Kerry

Mark Anthony Kerry (born 4 August 1959) is an Australian former <a href="backstroke">backstroke</a> and <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyle swimmer</a> of the 1970s and 1980s, who won three Olympic medals, including a gold in the 4 × 100 m medley relay at the <a href="1980%20Summer%20Olympics">1980 Summer Olympics</a> as the backstroker for the "<a href="Quietly%20Confident%20Quartet">Quietly Confident Quartet</a>". During his career, he won twelve Australian Championships.

Initially trained by his mother, Kerry enjoyed success in swimming and <a href="surf%20lifesaving">surf lifesaving</a> as a teenager. His swimming career progressed to senior Australian standards after he switched to the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. He made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships and promptly won the 200 m freestyle and backstroke events to win selection for the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> in Montreal at the age of 16. At the Olympics, Kerry reached the final in two events, coming seventh and fifth in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke respectively. Kerry was disappointed with his performances, but they attracted the attention of American coach <a href="Doc%20Counsilman">Doc Counsilman</a>, who invited Kerry to swim under him at the <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, but his international career hit trouble when he was expelled from the <a href="1978%20Commonwealth%20Games">1978 Commonwealth Games</a> team for breaking a curfew.

Kerry returned to Australia in 1980 for the national championships and gained selection for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke double. Kerry declined financial inducements and resisted political pressure from the <a href="government%20of%20Australia">government of Australia</a> to boycott the Olympics in protest at the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>. He went on to win bronze in the 200 m backstroke after missing the final in the 100 m. The peak of his career came in the 4 × 100 m medley relay, where he led off the winning team. The race remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at the Olympics. After the games, Kerry took an extended break from the sport, before returning for the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a> in Los Angeles. He claimed a bronze in the medley relay and came fifth in the 100 m backstroke. He then retired and took up a television and modelling career in the United States. After returning to Australia, he ran and owned Dunhill Management, one of the largest recruiting firms in the nation, with his brother. In 2001, the Kerry brothers sold Dunhill for , with up to A$13.8 million in additional payments depending on the success of the company. They later founded a new recruitment firm, K2.

Born in <a href="Temora%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Temora, New South Wales</a>, near the regional centre of <a href="Wagga%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, Kerry was one of two sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. Kerry was taught to swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke. Kerry grew up participating in a wide range of sports, representing <a href="Wollongong%20High%20School">Wollongong High School</a> in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of <a href="Wollongong">Wollongong</a>, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much more exciting due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, <a href="Brad%20Cooper">Brad Cooper</a>—who went on to win the 400 m freestyle at the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a>—was living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in <a href="Brisbane%2C%20Queensland">Brisbane, Queensland</a> in the following year. At the time of his move, Kerry was ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.

Kerry had improved to such an extent that by November 1975, his times in the 200 m backstroke had dropped from around 2 m 10 s to around 2 m 3.0 s, ranking him third in the world. As a result of his strong performances in the pool, Kerry retired from surf racing. Kerry made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships, winning the 200 m freestyle and backstroke events in 1 m 54.33 s and 2 m 3.58 s respectively, as well as the 4 × 200 m freestyle and the 4 × 100 m medley relays for New South Wales, leading off both relays. Aged 16, Kerry won selection for the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> in Montreal in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, the 200 m freestyle, the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay and the 4 × 100 m medley relay.

Kerry was second in his heat of the 200 m freestyle heat in a time of 1 m 54.86 s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final. His time was 2.08 s behind the slowest qualifier, placing him 16th. Kerry did not get to swim in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88 s after <a href="Peter%20Dawson%20%28swimmer%29">Peter Dawson</a> swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.

Kerry found more success in the 100 m backstroke, winning his heat in 57.99 s to qualify third fastest for the semifinals. He then scraped into the final as the second slowest qualifier, after coming fourth in his semifinal in a time of 58.04 s. His time of 57.94 s placed him seventh in the final, ahead of fellow Australian <a href="Mark%20Tonelli">Mark Tonelli</a>, but more than two seconds behind the victorious <a href="John%20Naber">John Naber</a> of the United States. In the 200 m event, Kerry put in a personal best time of 2 m 3.58 s in the first heat to qualify fourth fastest for the final, but swam slower in the decider to finish fifth in a time of 2 m 4.07 s, one place behind Tonelli and 2.72 s away from bronze. Kerry combined with <a href="Paul%20Jarvie%20%28swimmer%29">Paul Jarvie</a>, <a href="Neil%20Rogers%20%28swimmer%29">Neil Rogers</a> and <a href="Peter%20Coughlan">Peter Coughlan</a> in the 4 × 100 m medley relay, placing sixth. The quartet qualified in sixth place, and Kerry had them in fourth place after posting a time of 57.94 s in the first leg, but his teammates were unable to keep up with the leaders and finished more than four seconds out of medal contention.

Kerry was disappointed with his performances, feeling that he had failed to perform to his potential amid the pressure and excitement of an Olympics. However, he felt that his experience of racing against the likes of Naber and <a href="Roland%20Matthes">Roland Matthes</a> would hold him in good stead. On a brighter note, Kerry's performances impressed the leading American coach <a href="Doc%20Counsilman">Doc Counsilman</a>, who invited him to come and swim at <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a> after Kerry finished his secondary schooling in Australia. Kerry successfully defended his 200 m backstroke national title in 1977, but the time was more than four seconds slower than his effort in the previous year. He combined with his New South Wales teammates to win all three relays, again in times substantially slower than in the preceding Olympic year. The performances earned him selection for the Australian team for the Coca-Cola Meet in <a href="London">London</a>, but Kerry felt that he lacked motivation after the Olympics. Upon returning, he decided to absent himself from such events.

In January 1978, Kerry arrived at Indiana University, studying theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on the times that he recorded for Indiana, Kerry was named in the Australian squad for the <a href="1978%20Commonwealth%20Games">1978 Commonwealth Games</a> in Edmonton, Canada. However, his international career appeared to be in disarray when along with two teammates, Tonelli and <a href="Joe%20Dixon%20%28swimmer%29">Joe Dixon</a>, he was expelled from the Australian team for breaking a curfew on <a href="American%20Independence%20Day">American Independence Day</a> during a training camp in Honolulu, Hawaii. According to Tonelli, Kerry was late because he was courting a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>—not illegal under Hawaii law—on the night. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions, saying that it was not illegal. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>, launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio, which garnered thousands of signatures, but to no avail.

Kerry returned to Indiana and continued his training. He competed at the 1979 <a href="United%20States%20Swimming%20Championships">U.S. National Championships</a> at Fort Lauderdale, setting Australian records in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke in times of 56.50 s and 2 m 2.61 s respectively. Over time, Kerry became increasingly discontented with Counsilman, who he felt was losing focus and becoming preoccupied with various business commitments and an attempt to swim across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. Kerry transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, which was coached by Naber's mentor <a href="Peter%20Daland">Peter Daland</a>.

Kerry returned home to compete in the 1980 Australian Championships, winning both backstroke events, albeit in a slower time than his Australian records. Kerry added two titles as a member of the 4 × 100 m medley and freestyle relay teams for New South Wales. This earned Kerry his second trip to the Olympics, this time in Moscow. However, another obstacle arose with the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the United States. The Australian <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> was also the patron of the <a href="Australian%20Olympic%20Committee">Australian Olympic Committee</a>, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Kerry's teammate Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete. Kerry was equally adamant that he was going to compete, unlike some other swimmers who made personal boycotts. He received offers from Australian government officials to boycott the Games in return for financial payments. He said:

Upon leaving the US for the Olympics, Kerry was threatened with the cancellation of his US visa. Kerry arrived in Moscow facing a four event schedule: he was nominated in both backstroke events and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay and the 4 × 100 m medley relay. With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100 m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and <a href="Glenn%20Patching">Glenn Patching</a>, would all make the final and win medals. Kerry came third in both his heat and semi-final, clocking 58.08 s and 58.07 s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02 s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18 s faster. Patching missed the final after slipping on the starting wall in his race, while Tonelli went on to finish seventh. Had Kerry matched his personal best of 65.50 s, he would have won the gold medal ahead of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>'s <a href="Bengt%20Baron">Bengt Baron</a>.

Kerry bounced back in the 200 m backstroke and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze in a time of 2 m 3.14 s behind the <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> duo of <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Wlad%C3%A1r">Sándor Wladár</a> and <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Verraszt%C3%B3">Zoltán Verrasztó</a>. He edged out the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="Vladimir%20Shemetov">Vladimir Shemetov</a> by 0.34 s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since <a href="David%20Theile">David Theile</a> in 1960. In the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, <a href="Graeme%20Brewer">Graeme Brewer</a> and <a href="Ron%20McKeon">Ron McKeon</a> as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth by the end of his leg, just 0.78 s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1 m 52.64 s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon could not keep pace with the opposition anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52 s outside the medals.

The 4 × 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Kerry's Moscow campaign. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics">in 1960</a>, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia was regarded as a medal chance, but was not seen as the main threats—Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were seen as the most likely winners. The hosts's team included the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would later place fourth. The British had <a href="Duncan%20Goodhew">Duncan Goodhew</a>, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m. Australia's team paled in comparison on paper. <a href="Neil%20Brooks">Neil Brooks</a>, the freestyler, later came 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and <a href="Peter%20Evans%20%28swimmer%29">Peter Evans</a> was the only individual medallist in the corresponding individual event. Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100 m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">Munich in 1972</a>. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.

Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its "de facto" leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.

As Patching had slipped earlier in the meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s, leaving Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Medal">Australian Sports Medal</a> for their victory in Moscow.

After the Olympics, Kerry took an extended break from competitive swimming. He was asked to return for the <a href="1982%20Commonwealth%20Games">1982 Commonwealth Games</a> in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident in his ability to perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190 cm, 80 kg body in shape while not training.

He returned to Australia in 1984 and after training in Brisbane, he was selected for the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> despite winning neither backstroke event at the Australian Championships. Arriving in the United States, Kerry was scheduled to compete in the 100 m backstroke and 4 × 100 m medley relay. Kerry swam quickly to win his heat in the 100 m in a time of 57.15 s, qualifying third fastest for the final. However, he was unable to improve his pace in the final, finishing fifth in a time of 57.18 s, 0.69 s from the bronze medal. In the medley relay, Kerry and Evans joined <a href="Glenn%20Buchanan">Glenn Buchanan</a> and <a href="Mark%20Stockwell">Mark Stockwell</a>, who swam the butterfly and freestyle respectively. They were no match for the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the corresponding individual events and finished almost four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third place at the first change, finishing his leg in a time of 57.12 s, but by this point the Americans were already 1.71 s ahead. Australia remained third at every change and were beaten by the second-placed Canadians by just 0.02 s.

After the Games, Kerry retired from competitive swimming. He then worked in Los Angeles as a model and hosted a fashion show on cable television. According to Tonelli, Kerry's mother told her son to "look after that face, [because] that's all you've got". Tonelli disagreed, opining that "he was always much more than that". Tonelli reported that Kerry was busy preening himself just before the start of their Olympic-winning relay performance, claiming that although Australia was unlikely to win the race, he needed to look good because a prospective employer might be watching. Kerry went on to model on the catwalks of <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Kerry married his American wife Lynda, and they split their time between Australia and the United States. They have two children, a son Tanner who is a semi-professional basketball player, and a daughter Madison, who is an actress appearing on <a href="Home%20and%20Away">Home and Away</a>. Along with his brother Phil, Kerry founded Dunhill Management, one of Australia's largest recruiting firms. In 2001, the brothers sold Dunhill to the British firm Robert Walters for A$22.7 million, with up to A$13.8 million in extra payments depending on the future success of the company. After this, Kerry worked as the managing director of another firm, before starting a new recruitment business with his brother, K2 Recruitment & Consulting.

Sandra Morgan

Sandra Anne Morgan (born 6 June 1942), also known by her married name Sandra Beavis, or as Sandra Morgan-Beavis, is an Australian former <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyle</a> swimmer who was part of the gold medal-winning team in the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%204%20%C3%97%20100%20metre%20freestyle%20relay">4×100-metre freestyle relay</a> at the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a> in Melbourne. At the age of 14 years and 6 months, she became the youngest Australian to win an <a href="Olympic%20medal">Olympic gold medal</a>, a record that still stands.

Morgan began serious training in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team as well as the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20400%20metre%20freestyle">400-metre freestyle</a>. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of <a href="false%20start">false start</a>s. During the final, she lifted her head out of the water and saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.

In 1957, she won the 110-, 220-, and 440-yard treble at the <a href="Australian%20Swimming%20Championships">Australian Championships</a> in the absence of her main rivals, but from that point on her career was plagued by illness and weight problems. She was selected in the <a href="1958%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> purely as a relay swimmer, winning gold in the event. At her second Olympic Games, the <a href="1960%20Summer%20Olympics">1960 Summer Olympics</a> in Rome, she only competed in the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%204%20%C3%97%20100%20metre%20freestyle%20relay">4 × 100 relay heats</a>; her teammates went on to win silver in the final. She retired from competitive swimming following the Rome Olympics.

In retirement, she has continued her involvement in swimming and the Olympics by teaching <a href="paralympic%20swimming">disabled children to swim</a> and participating in Olympic educational programs and <a href="Olympic%20flame">torch relays</a>. She is also an ambassador for <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a> and has appeared on television as part of her work with Christian groups.

Morgan was born in the north-western <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> city of <a href="Tamworth%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tamworth</a>, before growing up in <a href="Punchbowl%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Punchbowl</a>, a suburb in <a href="South-western%20Sydney">South-western Sydney</a>. Morgan was the oldest of four children, with two sisters and a brother. Her father Barrington, a plumber, had success as a swimmer in his childhood, but a lack of facilities in rural Australia curtailed his career. As a result, he vowed that his daughter would become a national champion. Morgan said her father "became my driving and inspirational force. I not only fulfilled his ambition, but surpassed it by becoming an Olympic champion!" Morgan also cited her meetings with <a href="Frederick%20Lane">Frederick Lane</a>—Australia's first Olympic gold medallist in swimming—and the Olympic athletics champion <a href="Marjorie%20Jackson-Nelson">Marjorie Jackson-Nelson</a> as key inspirational moments in her career.

Morgan learned to swim at <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown</a> at the age of 7. She was initially slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of <a href="Frank%20Guthrie%20%28swimmer%29">Frank Guthrie</a> in <a href="Enfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Enfield</a>. At the time, Guthrie was regarded as one of the best coaches in the state; his students included <a href="Gary%20Chapman%20%28swimmer%29">Gary Chapman</a>, <a href="Kevin%20O%27Halloran">Kevin O'Halloran</a> and <a href="Lorraine%20Crapp">Lorraine Crapp</a>. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a>. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.

Under Guthrie's coaching, Morgan quickly became one of the fastest junior swimmers in the state, winning the under-14 110-yard and 55-yard freestyle, as well as the 110-yard <a href="butterfly%20swimming">butterfly</a> at the New South Wales Championships in 1956. She went on to win the junior 110-yard freestyle at the Australian Championships, despite causing two false starts. After the national titles, she represented <a href="http%3A//www.marrickvil-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/our-school">Marrickville Junior Girls' High School</a> and won the State Combined High School Championship in the 110-yard freestyle.

Although her times were among the fastest in the country, Morgan's youth prevented selection for the Olympic training squad. However, the <a href="Swimming%20Australia">Australian Swimming Union</a> allowed her to join the squad for training in Townsville at her own expense. Her family was unable to meet these costs, but a fundraising campaign by the Bankstown community allowed her to make the trip. Training in the <a href="Tobruk%20Memorial%20Baths">Tobruk Memorial Baths</a> alongside swimmers such as Crapp, <a href="Alva%20Colquhoun">Alva Colquhoun</a>, <a href="Faith%20Leech">Faith Leech</a> and <a href="Dawn%20Fraser">Dawn Fraser</a>, Morgan's times steadily improved. The team were expected to swim three times a day, totalling more than . However, Morgan was not regarded as a likely selection in the final team.

Following the training camp, a series of selection trials were held in Brisbane and Melbourne. In three 100-metre races, Morgan came third, fifth and fourth respectively, with a best time of 1 minute 7.3 seconds. She recorded a best performance of third in a time of 5 minutes 10.0 seconds in the 400-metre freestyle behind Crapp and Fraser. Australia was entitled to three representatives in each individual event, thus allowing Morgan to compete in her first Olympics. Morgan missed out in the 100-metre freestyle as Fraser, Crapp and Leech were selected, but she gained an individual berth in the 400-metre along with Fraser and Crapp. She was one of six swimmers selected for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad, the first from Australia to compete at Olympic level. Morgan was placed under substantial pressure by media commentary that regarded her as the weak link in the relay team.

Arriving in Melbourne for the Olympics, Morgan was not assured of a place in the final relay quartet. Fraser and Crapp were rested in the heats on 4 December while the remaining four swimmers qualified the team. Morgan swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.4 seconds, the fastest of the Australians, securing her position in the final four along with Leech. Australia qualified quickest for the final, winning the second heat by 3.1 seconds. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than the <a href="South%20Africa%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics">South Africans</a> and <a href="United%20States%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics">Americans</a>, respectively, both of which swam in the first heat.

The selection of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, as they were the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20100%20metre%20freestyle">individual 100-metre event</a>; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than everyone else in the world.

The Australian team made a poor start in the final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had occurred after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' <a href="Sylvia%20Ruuska">Sylvia Ruuska</a>. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained the lead in the first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American <a href="Nancy%20Simons">Nancy Simons</a>. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory was the first time that Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time that this has been achieved was by the Americans in <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920</a> in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Games</a> in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.

Morgan's individual event was the 400-metre freestyle. She reduced her personal best by 2.3 seconds in recording a time of 5 minutes 7.8 seconds in the heats, just 0.2 of a second behind <a href="Marley%20Shriver">Marley Shriver</a> of the United States, who set a new Olympic record. The mark was surpassed in later heats by Fraser and Crapp, but Morgan nevertheless qualified fourth fastest for the final, almost seven seconds faster than the cutoff. The final was held the day after the relay final. Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance, finishing sixth in a time of 5 minutes 14.3 seconds, far outside her personal best. Had she repeated her heat swim, she would have placed fourth, just 0.7 of a second from the bronze medal. Nevertheless, she noted that "I was so happy that I had made the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for this was my first appearance in a senior competition".

Upon her return to Bankstown, Morgan was honoured with a civic reception and presented with a gold watch and life membership of the Bankstown Pool. However, her stay at the Olympic Village had given rise to a new problem. She enjoyed the food so much that she had gained in weight, and now stood at and weighed . This heralded the start of a continual weight problem.

After the Olympics, Crapp and Fraser took a break from competitive swimming, while Leech retired. This allowed Morgan an opening, and she won both the junior and open sprint titles at the 1957 New South Wales Championships. She followed this by winning three individual titles at the Australian Championships in Canberra: the 110-, 220- and 440-yard freestyle, in times of 1 minute 7.8 seconds; 2 minutes 29.3 seconds; and 5 minutes 21.6 seconds, respectively. Her times were slower than her bests in 1956. She was part of the New South Wales team that won the 4×100-yard freestyle and medley relays, anchoring both quartets.

In 1958, Crapp and Fraser returned to the pool, while <a href="Ilsa%20Konrads">Ilsa Konrads</a> emerged as a leading swimmer. At the Australian Championships, Morgan came third in both the 110-yard and 440-yard freestyle events; Fraser won both and Crapp and Konrads placed second in the 110-yard and 440-yard freestyle respectively. Morgan was selected for the <a href="1958%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Cardiff, Wales, but only in the 4×110-yard freestyle relay. Along with Fraser, Crapp and Konrads, she broke the world record for the event in March in Sydney with a time of 4 minutes 18.9 seconds. At the Empire Games, Fraser, Crapp, Morgan and Colquhoun lowered the world record to a time of 4 minutes 17.4 seconds to win gold.

After the Empire Games, the Australian team returned home via France, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Singapore for a series of competitions. Morgan's best performances were at the Dutch and French Championships, where she came third in the 400-metre events. In 1959, she placed third in both the 440-yard and 880-yard freestyle events at the Australian Championships. Her swimming career was then interrupted by <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, which developed into <a href="bronchial%20pneumonia">bronchial pneumonia</a>. The illness forced her to take an extended break. Her chest problems persisted when she returned to competition at the 1960 Australian Championships, placing third in the 220-yard and 440-yard freestyle and fifth in the 110-yard freestyle. She gained selection for the <a href="1960%20Summer%20Olympics">1960 Summer Olympics</a> in Rome as a member of the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad. She swam the first leg in the heats, posting a time of 1 minute 5.5 seconds, giving Australia a 1.0-second lead. Australia led at every change and went on to win its heat by five seconds, qualifying fastest for the final. However, Morgan posted the slowest leg of the Australian quartet and was dropped when Fraser and Konrads were brought into the team for the final, in which Australia won silver. Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not awarded medals if the final quartet placed in the top three positions. Suffering from periodic chest pain, Morgan retired from competitive swimming in December 1960.

Morgan married George Beavis in 1965 and had three daughters, all of whom enjoyed swimming victories at school and district level. After her marriage, she lived in the <a href="Outback">Outback</a> towns of <a href="Griffith%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Griffith</a> and <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Orange</a> for six years before returning to Sydney. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children to swim in her backyard pool, and was given a government grant to continue her work. She then ran a swimming school at <a href="Bonnet%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bonnet Bay</a> for 15 years and worked at the Bates Drive Special School, receiving a grant to teach preschool handicapped children swimming. In later life, Morgan successfully fought a life-threatening battle against <a href="systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">lupus</a>, and in 2004 she was living in <a href="Sutherland%20Shire">Sutherland Shire</a> in southern Sydney.

A committed Christian, Morgan has been a public speaker at functions for Seasons Christian Women's Conference. From January 1996 to mid-1999, she lived in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, along with her husband, who was posted there by his employer. During that time, Morgan worked as a Bible teacher at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Kuala Lumpur. She has also appeared on "Face to Face", a Christian television talk show that screens on the <a href="Ten%20Network">Ten Network</a>.

In 1995, Morgan was inducted into the Hall of Champions at the State Sports Centre and the Path of Champions at the <a href="Sydney%20International%20Aquatic%20Centre">Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre</a>. She has been involved in educational programs aimed at promoting the Olympic movement in schools and helps to raise funds for the <a href="Australian%20Olympic%20Committee">Australian Olympic Committee</a>. In 2000, Morgan was awarded the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian Government's</a> <a href="Australian%20Sports%20Medal">Australian Sports Medal</a> for her contributions to the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> held in Sydney and her achievements as a competitor. She has been awarded the honour of carrying the <a href="Olympic%20flame">Olympic torch</a> during its passage through Australia in both <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics%20torch%20relay">2000</a> and <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics%20torch%20relay">2004</a>.

Faith Leech

Faith Yvonne Leech (31 March 1941 – 14 September 2013) was an Australian <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyle swimmer</a> who won a gold medal in the 4×100–metre freestyle relay and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle at the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a> in Melbourne.

A tall and lean swimmer known for her elegant technique, Leech started swimming as a child to build strength after a series of stomach disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle at the age of 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. Leech produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event and seal an Australian <a href="trifecta">trifecta</a>, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. Leech retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.

The second child of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech was born in <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a> in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from <a href="leukaemia">leukaemia</a> at the age of two. A delicate child, Leech had an aversion to eating in the first two years of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.

Leech's health improved, but she remained slight and frail, with a double curvature of the back. In an effort to help her gain muscle control and confidence, her parents sent her to start ballet dancing, before trying swimming, a sport her mother had competed in. Aged six, she was taken to swimming classes while the family holidayed in the <a href="Mornington%20Peninsula">Mornington Peninsula</a>. Leech was coached by Gus Froelich, a former European swimming champion and coach of Australian Olympic medallist <a href="Judy-Joy%20Davies">Judy-Joy Davies</a>.

After a difficult start, Leech improved in her second year. At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, three seconds faster than Davies had done at the same age. She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the same age.

Living in Bendigo and studying at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel three times a year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.

From 1954, Leech attended St. Michael's Girls' Grammar School and trained with Froelich on a daily basis at the City Baths. The regular sessions paid off at the 1955 Victorian Championships; Leech won the open 110- and 220-yard freestyle in times of 1 minute 7.2 seconds and 2 minutes 39.3 seconds, respectively, setting state records in both events. She proceeded to the Australian Championships, winning the 110-yard freestyle in 1 minute 7.6 seconds to become the youngest ever winner of an open title at the age of 13. Leech also won the national junior 110- and 220-yard events.

Leech's regimen differed from most swimmers because Froelich was not an advocate of distance training, and designed shorter workouts for his students. She trained once a day, swimming no more than . Froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps when she felt tired, but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism, which Leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action. Leech stood 180 centimetres (5'11"), but weighed only , with broad shoulders, slim hips and large hands and feet. Her long streamlined action prompted observers to call her a "flying fish". Spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using the optimal <a href="flip%20turn">flip turn</a> preferred by freestyle swimmers. Instead, she was forced to utilise the <a href="touch%20turn">touch turn</a>, which was slower.

In August 1955, Leech set an Australian record of 1 minute 5.0 seconds for the 110-yard freestyle, before lowering it to 1 minute 4.8 seconds in October; this prompted newspapers to trumpet her as a prospect for the Melbourne Olympics. She did not get an opportunity to defend her Australian title in 1956 because she was hospitalised with illness. Leech recovered in time to win the national age title in the 100-metre freestyle in a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds, just 0.1 of a second outside <a href="Dawn%20Fraser">Dawn Fraser</a>'s world record. She then posted a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds to defeat Fraser and <a href="Lorraine%20Crapp">Lorraine Crapp</a> at another meeting in the following month.

Leech was named in the Olympic squad and the <a href="Swimming%20Australia">Australian Swimming Union</a> exempted her from travelling to the national training camp in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a> so she could train with Froelich, who understood her special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and <a href="Margaret%20Gibson%20%28swimmer%29">Margaret Gibson</a> to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.

Having arrived at the Olympics, Leech made her debut in the 100-metre freestyle, an event in which she, Fraser and Crapp were regarded as the three strongest competitors, although the latter two were considered to be substantially stronger. All three won their heats. Leech won her heat by 1.6 seconds in a time of 1 minute 4.9 seconds. She was third fastest qualifier behind Fraser and Crapp, who were over 1.5 seconds faster. Drawn in Fraser's semifinal, Leech finished second in a time of 1 minute 5.2 seconds, and was the third fastest qualifier for the final behind her compatriots. The semifinals followed a similar pattern to the heats, with Fraser and Crapp more than two seconds ahead of the six remaining qualifiers, who were separated by just 0.8 of a second.

This pattern was repeated in the final. Fraser and Crapp were far ahead of the field, finishing in 1 minute 2.0 seconds and 1 minute 2.3 seconds, respectively. Leech overtook the United States' <a href="Joan%20Rosazza">Joan Rosazza</a> in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been tight, with just 0.7 of a second separating Leech and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, Leech had come through to claim the last podium position. Leech said that it was an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing.

As the Australians boasted the three fastest swimmers in the individual 100-metre freestyle event, they were clear favourites for the corresponding relay, especially as Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than all of the other swimmers. Leech was not assured of a place in the final quartet. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four swimmers, <a href="Sandra%20Morgan">Sandra Morgan</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Fraser%20%28swimmer%29">Elizabeth Fraser</a>, Gibson and Leech qualified the team. Leech swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.9 seconds, the second fastest of the Australians, thereby securing her position in the final along with <a href="Sandra%20Morgan">Sandra Morgan</a>, who recorded a time of 1 minute 5.4 seconds. Australia won the second heat by 3.1 seconds to qualify quickest for the final. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than South Africa and the United States, respectively, both of whom swam in the first heat. The selection of Leech and Morgan generated controversy. They were Australia's youngest swimmers and lacked experience at open level competition: Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships, and both had competed at national level only once.
In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost stopped when she heard a second gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds slower than the world record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' <a href="Sylvia%20Ruuska">Sylvia Ruuska</a>. Nevertheless, this meant that Australia had a smaller than expected advantage. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained the lead in the first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds, with the Australian lead cut to 0.9 of a second. Even with the advantage of a flying start, Leech's leg was 0.4 of a second slower than her fastest time during the individual competition.

Morgan was then overhauled and passed by <a href="Nancy%20Simons">Nancy Simons</a>. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a>. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>.

After the 1956 Olympics, Leech retired from competitive swimming at the age of 15. She was the first person from Bendigo to win an Olympic medal and was <a href="%3Awikt%3Afeted">feted</a> upon returning to her hometown. She regarded the experience of living in the <a href="Olympic%20Village">Olympic Village</a> as an unusual one; in addition to the large crowds and the pressure of an Olympics, it was the first time that she had been away from the family home. Physicians endorsed her decision to retire, feeling that she became too nervous prior to races. Leech briefly worked in Melbourne as a model, before returning to Bendigo to help run the family jewellery business. She took a leading role in the business after the death of her father in the 1970s, before handing control of the firm to her son.

Leech married Mitch Tuohy and had two sons, Adam and Troy, whom she discouraged from entering competitive swimming, fearing the pressure and strain of racing. In retirement, she shunned competitive sport, but maintained her fitness and athleticism. She taught swimming to disabled children, some of whom represented Australia at the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>.

Leech continued her involvement with the Olympic movement through volunteer work. In July 1999, Leech and Australia's then-oldest man and World War I veteran <a href="Jack%20Lockett">Jack Lockett</a> were the guests of honour at a countdown celebration to the arrival of the <a href="Olympic%20Torch">Olympic Torch</a> in <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a> in July 2000. In 2001, she was diagnosed with a <a href="cancerous%20tumor">tumour</a> in her neck, which was the size of a 50c coin. The tumour was removed in a seven-hour operation followed by six weeks of radiotherapy treatment. This experience prompted her to become a volunteer for the <a href="Cancer%20Council%20Australia">Cancer Council</a> and help those who were diagnosed with the disease. In February 2003, Leech phoned quadruple Olympic champion <a href="Betty%20Cuthbert">Betty Cuthbert</a> to comfort her during her recovery from a <a href="brain%20hemorrhage">brain hemorrhage</a>. In October 2006, Leech combined with 1956 teammate <a href="John%20Devitt">John Devitt</a> to launch "50 Years On—The Melbourne Olympics", a series of stamps from the <a href="Australia%20Post">Australia Post</a>.

Leech is an inductee of the Path of Champions at <a href="Sydney%20International%20Aquatic%20Centre">Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre</a>. She died at her home on 14 September 2013, aged 72.

Abe Waddington

Abraham "Abe" Waddington, sometimes known as Abram Waddington (4 February 1893 – 28 October 1959), was a professional <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, who played in two <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>, both against <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> in 1920–21. Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a> with his left arm <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">fast-medium</a> bowling. Capable of making the ball <a href="Swing%20bowling">swing</a>, Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his <a href="bowling%20action">bowling action</a>. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes <a href="Sledging%20%28cricket%29">sledged</a> opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days.

Waddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War, when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920–21 <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared in two of the five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.

In the early 1920s, Waddington played several football matches for <a href="Halifax%20Town%20A.F.C.">Halifax Town</a> as a goalkeeper, and after his retirement from cricket enjoyed some success as an amateur golfer. He was in trouble with the police on more than one occasion and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers, the <a href="Minister%20of%20Food%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Food</a>; he was found not guilty. He died in 1959 at the age of 66.

Abraham Waddington was born in <a href="Clayton%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Clayton</a>, <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, on 4 February 1893, the eldest of three brothers. His family owned a fat-refining business managed by his father, Sam. When he left school, Waddington joined the family firm as a lorry driver, occasionally working in the refinery. He began playing cricket for Crossley Hall in the West Bradford League at the age of 11; as a teenager he played in the <a href="Bradford%20League">Bradford League</a> for Lidget Green and then Laisterdyke, gaining a local reputation as a <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">fast-medium bowler</a>. He helped Laisterdyke win the League championship in 1913, before moving to Wakefield for the 1914 season, where he took 98 wickets at an average of 12.00. He played for Yorkshire Second XI in August 1914, alongside future First XI teammates <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> and <a href="Cec%20Tyson">Cec Tyson</a>, but the outbreak of the First World War prevented him making any further appearances for the county.

When war was declared, Waddington volunteered for <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">Lord Kitchener's New Army</a>, joining the Bradford <a href="Pals%20battalion">Pals battalion</a> of the <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">West Yorkshire Regiment</a>. On 1 July 1916, during the <a href="First%20day%20on%20the%20Somme">first day</a> of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, Waddington was wounded by shrapnel at <a href="Serre-l%C3%A8s-Puisieux">Serre</a>, and took shelter in a crater in <a href="No%20man%27s%20land%23World%20War%20I">no man's land</a> with other wounded soldiers. One of these was the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> cricketer <a href="Major%20Booth">Major Booth</a>, who was mortally wounded. Waddington comforted Booth while the cricketer died in his arms, an experience which haunted Waddington for the rest of his life. After recovering, Waddington transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>.

Yorkshire's bowling attack was severely depleted when cricket resumed in 1919 owing to a combination of retirements and deaths in the war. Additionally, <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> was past his best, meaning that Yorkshire needed to recruit new <a href="fast%20bowlers">fast bowlers</a>. In May and June, the team struggled to dismiss opposing sides on hard pitches; their results were poor and when two important matches were lost in June, "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" suggested that "things looked very black".

At this point in the season the Yorkshire cricketers <a href="Roy%20Kilner">Roy Kilner</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Dolphin">Arthur Dolphin</a>, who like Waddington had also been wounded at the Somme, recommended him to the Yorkshire committee, probably after seeing him take part in cricket matches in the army. Having returned to play for Laisterdyke in the Bradford League, Waddington was called into the Yorkshire side at the beginning of July for the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> match against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>. On his first-class debut, he took four for 26 (four wickets for 26 runs) in 26 overs, and after missing the next match, he followed up with nine wickets against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> in his second game, taking his first <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">five wicket haul</a> in the second innings of that match. From Waddington's debut, Yorkshire's results improved and the team won the Championship. "Wisden" judged that Waddington's contribution was crucial: "Without him Yorkshire would certainly not have won the Championship". He and <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> formed an effective bowling partnership and, according to "Wisden", "Rhodes and Waddington, with <a href="Rockley%20Wilson">E. R. Wilson</a>, for a few weeks, and <a href="Emmott%20Robinson">[Emmott] Robinson</a> to help them, carried the eleven from success to success". It described Waddington as bowling "left-hand, medium pace inclining to fast", with a "delivery that seems part of himself—free from any suggestion of labour or undue effort"; it noted that he always bowled a <a href="Good%20length%20ball">good length</a> and made the ball bounce sharply after pitching. The writer judged Waddington's first season had been one of "exceptional promise" and predicted that Waddington would go on to "great things". In the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Derek Hodgson suggests that Waddington's versatility brought him success, as did the line which he bowled to the batsmen. He finished with 100 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 18.74, with eight five-wicket returns. Waddington was only the sixth bowler in first-class cricket history to reach 100 wickets in his debut year.

Yorkshire fell to fourth in the Championship in 1920; most of the bowling responsibility fell once more on Waddington and Rhodes, and the other bowlers provided little support. Despite a good start to the season, the team faded in the latter part of the year. "Wisden" suggested that "in the circumstances [Rhodes and Waddington] did wonders, Waddington having some irresistible days against the weaker counties." He took 141 wickets in the season at an average of 16.79. His best figures came in the two matches against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>: in the first game he took 11 wickets, and in the second took 13 wickets for 48 runs, including seven for 18 in the first innings, and a <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a>. Waddington's season concluded with his selection for the professional "Players" teams in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> match at the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a>. He was one of four players from Yorkshire chosen to <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201920%E2%80%9321">tour Australia that winter</a> with the MCC. Hodgson suggests that he was chosen as "the discovery of the first post-war period".

The 1920–21 MCC tour to Australia was unsuccessful for the tourists. Captained by <a href="Johnny%20Douglas">J. W. H. T. Douglas</a>, the team was overwhelmed by Australia, losing all five Test matches. "Wisden" stated that the "chief cause of failure was the bowling". The MCC had been reluctant to tour so soon after the war, and critics had predicted the bowling would be weak in Australian conditions, where the pitches were generally hard and good for batting.

At the beginning of November, before the first-class matches began, Waddington was operated on for abscesses, and missed the first five games. He played only one first-class match before the first Test, but took wickets in several minor matches. Selected for the first Test, he took the first wicket to fall in the game, that of <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a>, but failed to take another wicket in the match while conceding 88 runs, hampered by a leg injury in the later stages. He did not play another Test until the fourth, where he bowled five overs for 31 runs. Waddington ended the tour with seven wickets at an average of 46.71; his single Test wicket was at a cost of 119 runs. The tour was a frustrating experience for Waddington, who found the heat difficult to deal with; he was also unhappy that most of his appearances came in the non-first-class country matches, many against opponents fielding more than eleven players to make a more even fight. Throughout the tour, the press criticised Douglas for the way he used bowlers. Although Yorkshire used Waddington in short bursts with the objective of taking wickets, Douglas used him to bowl long defensive spells with the prime objective of run-saving, a task to which Waddington was unsuited. Considered a failure—"Wisden" later described his tour as "a sad disappointment"—Waddington did not play for England again and was never seriously considered for a recall. He did have one batting success on the tour, scoring his maiden first-class fifty against an "Australian XI".

In the 1921 season, Waddington took 105 wickets at an average of 18.94. The introduction of the pace bowler <a href="George%20Macaulay">George Macaulay</a> into the team gave him more support, but according to a later edition of "Wisden", Waddington's form was poor that year. The almanack's review of the 1921 season suggested that, when at full strength, Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship, but the team finished third. Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year: the county won the first of four successive championships, and Waddington took 133 wickets at an average of 16.08. He was often effective in the most important matches. "Wisden" suggested that "Yorkshire were very good at every point, but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling ... [Waddington] was, on occasions, more successful against strong sides than he had ever been before. He had days of astonishing success and once, at least, bowled with a bewildering swerve [i. e. <a href="swing%20bowling">swing bowling</a>] that recalled George Hirst at his best." Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire (the best of his career), seven wickets for six runs in a <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> total of 20 and eight for 35 against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. His season ended with festival games at <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex-<a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> servicemen.

Waddington was less effective in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he slipped on wet grass when he was about to bowl against Leicestershire at <a href="Fartown%20Ground%23Cricket">Fartown Ground</a>, <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn <a href="ligament">ligament</a>. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">batting average</a> better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.

On his return in 1924, Waddington bowled little in his first matches, but was used more in Yorkshire's defeat by <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> where he bowled 42 overs to take three for 116. Several Yorkshire players were absent, playing representative matches, but the game had consequences later in the season. In the return match at <a href="Bramall%20Lane%23Cricket%20at%20the%20Lane">Sheffield</a> in July, the Yorkshire players seemed determined to have revenge but could only secure a draw. Critics thought that the Yorkshire bowlers <a href="Appeal%20%28cricket%29">appealed</a> excessively to the <a href="Umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpires</a>, and the Middlesex players were barracked by the crowd. The journalist <a href="Alfred%20Pullin">Alfred Pullin</a> described the match as "a sorry exhibition of ill feeling and bad manners."

The umpires reported Waddington to the cricket committee of the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a> persuaded him to write a letter of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain <a href="Geoffrey%20Wilson%20%28cricketer%29">Geoffrey Wilson</a> had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of "Wisden" suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned at the end of the season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player <a href="J.%20W.%20Hearne">J. W. Hearne</a> around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.

Waddington took more than 100 wickets in a season for the final time in 1925. Although his form was mixed, he achieved some good performances. "Wisden" attributed Yorkshire's championship victory to their bowlers and suggested that "Waddington enjoyed a well-merited success". In total, he took 109 wickets at an average of 20.24. In 1926 both he and the other bowlers were less successful as Yorkshire slipped to second. "Wisden" noticed a decline in his bowling, but expected him to recover his form. He took 78 wickets at an average of 23.30, and scored his highest aggregate with the bat in a season, making 525 runs with two fifties. In the English winter of 1926–27, he travelled to India and worked as a cricket coach.

Waddington's bowling declined further in 1927, to the point where "Wisden" suggested his record was poor and his "work was only occasionally worthy of his reputation". The effectiveness of the other bowlers was similarly reduced, and combined with a cautious, safety-first approach, Yorkshire had a mixed season and finished third. Waddington took 45 wickets at 32.02, and conceded a high number of runs on many occasions. However, in what was his last season, he scored his only first-class century, an innings of 114 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. His final first-class appearance was for the North against the South at the Folkestone Festival, where he bowled 16 overs without taking a wicket. At the end of the season, Waddington was offered a new contract despite his decline in bowling and continuing problems from his injured shoulder. He turned it down, ending his county cricket career. In all first-class matches, Waddington took 852 wickets at an average of 19.75 and scored 2,527 runs at an average of 12.89 with four fifties as well as the century. The following season, Yorkshire awarded him a <a href="Testimonial%20match">testimonial</a> of £1,000.

Waddington bowled with control, maintaining a good length while his <a href="Bowling%20action">action</a> made the ball swing away from the batsman. For variation, he delivered an <a href="off%20cutter">off-cutter</a> and when he bowled, the ball seemed to increase its speed after bouncing. He often bowled <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">around the wicket</a>. His curved <a href="Run-up%20%28cricket%29">run-up</a> began from the <a href="Leg%20side">on side</a> of the wicket, and he ran behind the umpire. He then released the ball from the corner of the <a href="Crease%20%28cricket%29%23Bowling%20crease">bowling crease</a>, creating a sharp angle for the batsman to face, sometimes using <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short deliveries</a> with a <a href="Leg%20theory">ring of leg side fielders</a>. Waddington modelled his bowling on that of George Hirst, a fellow left-arm paceman who also acted as a coach and mentor to him in his early career, but Derek Hodgson notes that the two men were very different in personality: Waddington was far more quick-tempered than Hirst. Waddington's bowling action was noted for its excellence and perfection. <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, the journalist and cricket writer, described it as "gloriously rhythmical", and "so lovely that one simply cannot deny he is a good bowler." But too often, Cardus suggested, he was "ever raising hopes that real greatness will come from him, only to disappoint again and again".

Although Waddington scored a first-class century in his final season, he did not live up to his batting potential despite a good style. A <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">lower-order batsman</a>, he was inclined to be dismissed through playing irresponsible shots. Herbert Sutcliffe believed that, had he not been a bowler, Waddington may have developed into a leading batsman; he wrote that Waddington "had as delightful a batting style as he had a bowling style." But Sutcliffe suggested that Waddington did not possess the required patience: "He used to hit up a brilliant 30 or 40 before making a perfectly silly shot".

Waddington resented the class divisions in English cricket, his feelings fuelled by experiences of officers in the war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920–21. He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and <a href="Sledging%20%28cricket%29">sledged</a> opposing batsmen, both of which were unusual at the time. His "Times" obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a "wild and irresponsible ... quick-tempered individual". But there was another side to his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington, called him "a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman." The cricket writer <a href="Jim%20Kilburn">Jim Kilburn</a> wrote that "at his best, [Waddington] was a magnificently hostile bowler with one of the most beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and break-back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen". The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up: "Yes, a man of temper, Waddington, but a fine cricketer."

When Waddington retired from first-class cricket, he took over the family business. He played as a professional for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC in the <a href="Birmingham%20and%20District%20Premier%20League">Birmingham League</a> in 1928, and for <a href="Accrington">Accrington</a> in 1929 and 1930. He maintained friendships with several members of the Yorkshire team and was a pallbearer at Kilner's funeral in 1928. In 1954–55, the Yorkshire player and England captain <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> invited Waddington to accompany the members of the MCC team to Australia. En route by sea, the team visited the grave of <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a>, the Yorkshire bowler who was killed in Italy in the Second World War and buried there. Including his visit as a player, Waddington made five trips to Australia.

Waddington had success in other sports, especially as an amateur <a href="Association%20football">football</a> goalkeeper. He was with <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> in the 1920–21 football season, but did not play a match for them. For the 1921–22 season, he played for <a href="Halifax%20Town%20A.F.C.">Halifax Town</a>, making seven appearances in <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. He was a good enough golfer to represent Yorkshire, to partner <a href="Henry%20Cotton%20%28golfer%29">Henry Cotton</a>, and to play in the qualifying rounds of <a href="the%20Open%20Championship">the Open Championship</a> in 1935 and 1939. Sutcliffe wrote that leading golfers told him that had Waddington not been a cricketer, he had the talent to have succeeded as a golfer, although he was prone to carelessness in his play. One Bradford golf club banned him after he poured a glass of beer over the captain, who Waddington believed had used inappropriate language in front of a woman. A motorcycling enthusiast, he regularly attended the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20TT">Isle of Man TT</a>, although his love of fast cars brought him trouble from the police at times. After one incident in 1938, he was fined £5 for assaulting a policeman and using obscene language after being asked to dip his headlights. In 1950, he was fined and banned from driving for a year after being found drunk while attempting to start up his car. In mitigation, his lawyer claimed he was suffering from "overwork, worry and insomnia."

At the start of the Second World War, Waddington was appointed chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the <a href="Minister%20of%20Food%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Food</a>. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled that there was no way that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.

Waddington was married twice. In 1925, he married Mabel Fawell; none of his Yorkshire teammates were aware that he was getting married. In 1952, he married Doris Garforth; on this occasion, many of his former cricketing colleagues attended. After a long illness, Waddington died in a <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66. He was cremated in Bradford.

Maxinquaye

Maxinquaye is the debut album by English rapper and producer <a href="Tricky%20%28musician%29">Tricky</a>. It was released on 20 February 1995 by <a href="4th%20%26amp%3B%20B%27way%20Records">4th & B'way Records</a>. 

In the years leading up to the album, Tricky had grown frustrated with his limited role in the musical group <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a> and discovered vocalist <a href="Martina%20Topley-Bird">Martina Topley-Bird</a>, who he felt would offer another dimension to his lyrics. He signed a solo contract with <a href="4th%20%26amp%3B%20B%27way%20Records">4th & B'way Records</a> in 1993 and recorded "Maxinquaye" the following year, primarily at his home studio in London with Topley-Bird as the album's main vocalist. Additional singers included <a href="Alison%20Goldfrapp">Alison Goldfrapp</a>, Ragga, and <a href="Mark%20Stewart%20%28musician%29">Mark Stewart</a>.

"Maxinquaye" was produced by Tricky with assistance from <a href="Mark%20Saunders%20%28record%20producer%29">Mark Saunders</a>, who helped him use <a href="dub%20music">dub</a> production techniques and heavily altered <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> taken from a variety of sources. The record's <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="ambient%20techno">ambient techno</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, and <a href="experimental%20music">experimental music</a>. Its songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, and <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drug use</a>; Tricky drew on his experiences in British drug culture and the influence of his late mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.

"Maxinquaye" reached the number three position on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom's albums chart</a> and sold over 100,000 copies in its first few months of release. 4th & B'way marketed the album by relying on independent record promoters and Tricky's appearances in media, including publicity photographs and music videos that portrayed him and Topley-Bird in <a href="gender%20bender">gender-bending</a> fashion. "Maxinquaye" was cited by many journalists as the year's best record and the key release of the burgeoning <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> genre. Since then, it has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide and ranks frequently on lists of the greatest albums, while regarded as a significant influence on <a href="electronica">electronica</a>, <a href="underground%20hip%20hop">underground hip hop</a>, and <a href="British%20hip%20hop">British hip hop</a>.

After a troubled upbringing in the <a href="Knowle%20West">Knowle West</a> neighbourhood of <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, Tricky became involved with an eclectic collective of <a href="disc%20jockey">DJ</a>s and musicians known as <a href="The%20Wild%20Bunch%20%28sound%20system%29">The Wild Bunch</a> during the late 1980s. As part of the collective, he helped arrange <a href="Sound%20system%20%28Jamaican%29">sound systems</a> around Bristol's club scene and performed raps under a stage name derived from "Tricky Kid", the nickname given to him in a street gang as a youth. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal with <a href="4th%20%26amp%3B%20B%27way%20Records">4th & B'way Records</a> and released two singles but their slow, experimental sound failed to make a commercial impact. The collective dissolved in 1989, but eventually led to the formation of the group <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a>, with Tricky a frequent collaborator who rapped over their productions; he later reworked material he had written for Massive Attack on "Maxinquaye".

Tricky eventually grew frustrated with his role in Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered <a href="Martina%20Topley-Bird">Martina Topley-Bird</a>, then a teenager at <a href="Clifton%20College">Clifton College</a>, when he saw her sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. "That's really how it happened," she recalled. "A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our <a href="General%20Certificate%20of%20Education">GCSEs</a>. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then <a href="Mark%20Stewart%20%28musician%29">Mark Stewart</a>, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." They formed a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, "Aftermath", later appeared on "Maxinquaye". After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album "<a href="Blue%20Lines">Blue Lines</a>", Tricky released "Aftermath" independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.

Tricky asked <a href="Mark%20Saunders%20%28record%20producer%29">Mark Saunders</a> to co-produce "Maxinquaye" after being impressed by his previous work with English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a> on their albums "<a href="Mixed%20Up%20%28The%20Cure%20album%29">Mixed Up</a>" (1990) and "<a href="Wish%20%28The%20Cure%20album%29">Wish</a>" (1992). They recorded "Maxinquaye" in the first half of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in <a href="Kilburn%2C%20London">Kilburn</a>; further recording later took place at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in <a href="Notting%20Hill%2C%20London">Notting Hill</a>. <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>, 4th & B'Way's parent label, set up equipment in the home studio at Tricky's request, including an <a href="Akai%20S1000">Akai S1000</a> sampler, an <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari 1040</a> computer with <a href="Logic%20%28software%29">Logic</a> software, an <a href="Alesis%20ADAT">Alesis ADAT</a> recorder, an <a href="AKG%20Acoustics">AKG</a> C3000 microphone, a <a href="Behringer">Behringer</a> Composer <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">compressor</a>, and a <a href="Mackie">Mackie</a> 1604 <a href="mixing%20desk">mixing desk</a>. The recording sessions were somewhat chaotic, and Saunders, who had the impression he would only perform engineering duties, often found himself serving as a <a href="DJ">DJ</a> and <a href="Programming%20%28music%29">programmer</a>. Tricky instructed him on what to <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sample</a>, regardless of different tempos and pitches, and asked him to piece the results together, something Saunders achieved by <a href="pitch-shifting">pitch-shifting</a> the respective samples until the combination sounded satisfactory. The samples they experimented with were taken from the many <a href="vinyl%20LP">vinyl records</a> that Saunders recalled were "littered" all over Tricky's floor. Influenced by <a href="dub%20music">dub music</a>'s production techniques, Tricky exhaustively altered borrowed sounds on his <a href="Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampler</a>, mixed tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and preserved sounds that otherwise would have been unwanted in the final mix, including <a href="glitch">glitch</a>es and crackles.

According to American critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, "Maxinquaye"s <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a>-oriented and low-tempo music drew not only on dub but also on <a href="lo-fi%20music">lo-fi</a>, <a href="ambient%20techno">ambient techno</a>, and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, while James Hunter from "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, and 1980s English rock sounds into "a mercurial style of <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">dance music</a>". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" critic <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> classified the music as an intellectual form of <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>. Ben Walsh of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" called it an <a href="experimental%20music">experimental</a> album featuring a "heady blend" of soul, rock, <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a>, hip hop, dub, and <a href="electronica">electronica</a>. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite <a href="song%20structure">song structure</a> in mind: "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting the emphasis on the things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for <a href="musical%20notation">notational</a> conventions and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for "Maxinquaye" challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a> apart and composed in entirely different <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a>: "[Tricky] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character."

Almost all of Topley-Bird's vocals on "Maxinquaye" were recorded in a single take, a process she later said was "totally instinctive. There was no time to drum up an alter ego." Topley-Bird, a soft-spoken singer, found herself backed on most tracks by Tricky's rapped vocals. According to British music journalist <a href="Sean%20O%27Hagan%20%28journalist%29">Sean O'Hagan</a>, she sang with a "<a href="Voice%20break">broken voice</a>" that acted as "the perfect foil to Tricky's whispered and drawled raps". The <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> credited Tricky and Topley-Bird for vocals on all songs except "Pumpkin" and "You Don't", which Tricky performed with vocalists <a href="Alison%20Goldfrapp">Alison Goldfrapp</a> and Ragga, respectively. A printing error mistakenly credited the then-unknown Topley-Bird as "Martine" on the record. Other musicians were recruited to play instruments for some tracks, including guitarist <a href="James%20Stevenson%20%28musician%29">James Stevenson</a> and bassist <a href="Pete%20Briquette">Pete Briquette</a>. The band FTV performed on "Black Steel", which was a rock version of <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Steel%20in%20the%20Hour%20of%20Chaos">Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos</a>" (1988) and one of two remakes on "Maxinquaye"; Tricky also remade one of his contributions for Massive Attack, "<a href="Karmacoma">Karmacoma</a>" (1994), retitling it as "Overcome". Saunders contributed guitar himself, with the resulting improvisations treated as samples.

Tricky explained "Maxinquaye"s title in an interview with <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a>: "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a "place name" similar to the <a href="Rastafarian">Rastafarian</a> idea of <a href="Zion">Zion</a>. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a>, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in "Maxinquaye"s "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>"s Kenan Hebert, who called it "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, <a href="solipsism">solipsism</a>, and <a href="sociopathy">sociopathy</a>", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on "Aftermath". In an interview for "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>", Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then ... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? My mother ... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that."

While songs such as "Overcome" and "Suffocated Love" dealt with themes of "sexual paranoia and male dread of intimacy", the rest of "Maxinquaye" explored the psychological tolls of the British <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drug</a> culture, which Reynolds said served as a "temporary utopia" for a generation of users who otherwise lacked a "constructive outlet for its idealism". He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes. Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about <a href="end%20time">end time</a> for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from "<a href="Rastafari%23Zion%20vs.%20Babylon">Babylon</a>", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as "my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite" on "Hell Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, "I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution ... It's like, I can be as greedy as you. The conditioned part of me says 'yeah, I'm gonna go out and make money, I'm going to rule my own little kingdom.'" Christgau deemed the album's songs "audioramas of someone who's signed on to work for the wages of sin and lived to cash the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's "impressionistic prose poems" were written from the deviant perspective of the urban <a href="hedonism">hedonist</a>: ""Maxinquaye" is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive ... This was the inner-city blues, Bristol style".

The songs "Ponderosa", "Strugglin'", and "Hell Is Round the Corner" were inspired by Tricky's experiences with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and ecstasy, particularly a two-year binge and consequent state of despondency while on Massive Attack's payroll after the completion of "Blue Lines". His <a href="Stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream-of-consciousness</a> lyrics on "Maxinquaye" explore the delirious, despondent, and emotionally unstable state associated with drug use while offering a pessimistic view of the drug culture, as Tricky viewed the high of cocaine undeserved and the depth of thought achieved through ecstasy unsubstantial. In Reynolds' opinion, Tricky's experiences with drug-induced paranoia, anxiety, and visions of spectres and demons were represented in the production of songs such as "Aftermath" and "Hell Is Round the Corner". For the latter track, he altered and slowed down a vocal sample to give it a wounded <a href="basso%20profondo">basso profondo</a> sound, while channelling it through a <a href="loop%20%28music%29">loop</a> of an orchestral <a href="Isaac%20Hayes">Isaac Hayes</a> recording, "<a href="Black%20Moses%20%28album%29">Ike's Rap II</a>". On "Strugglin'", which sampled sounds of a creaking door and the click of a gun being loaded, Tricky's lyrics made explicit reference to his visions of "mystical shadows, fraught with no meaning".

After Tricky signed to 4th & B'way, the label reissued "Aftermath" in January 1994 and released "Ponderosa" in April to promote "Maxinquaye". The following year, three more <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released—"Overcome" in January, "Black Steel" in March, and "Pumpkin" in November. The label also released a four-track <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> entitled "<a href="The%20Hell%20E.P.">The Hell E.P.</a>" in July, which was a collaboration with American rap group <a href="Gravediggaz">Gravediggaz</a> and featured "Hell Is Round the Corner"; the song reached number 12 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">British singles chart</a>. 

4th & B'way relied on <a href="Independent%20promoter">independent record promoters</a> and Tricky's cover story in "<a href="NME">NME</a>" to promote "Maxinquaye", even though hip hop records in the United Kingdom generally received exposure through dance music dealers and press. According to 4th & B'way director Julian Palmer, the UK's demographic of young music buyers such as students was more progressive than in the United States, where he said the record would have to be marketed differently because of his <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">race</a>. He believed that much like <a href="Portishead%20%28band%29">Portishead</a>, a contemporary Bristol act, Tricky would have received airplay in the US on <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative</a> or <a href="college%20rock">college rock</a> radio if the label focused their efforts to promote him there: "Some people I've met were confused because he's black, and it's not easy to break through those barriers there." According to Rupert Howe from "Q", the album's music tested stylistic barriers and "sounded as alien to hip hop" as it did to the <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> sound popular in the UK at the time.

Publicity photos and music videos promoting "Maxinquaye" featured Tricky and Topley-Bird utilising <a href="Androgyny">androgynous</a> imagery. They were photographed on one occasion wearing <a href="gender-bending">gender-bending</a> clothing such as a <a href="Mufti%20%28dress%29">mufti</a>. Other promotional shots based on a wedding concept captured Topley-Bird dressed as the groom. As "The Independent"s Phil Johnson recalled, the very thin Tricky was dressed in drag as the bride and his sickly looking face "painted and preened", with smeared lipstick and a false eyelash in the style of <a href="Alex%20%28A%20Clockwork%20Orange%29">Alex</a> from the 1971 film "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>". In Johnson's opinion, the record's gender-bending promotional efforts were canny in how they "maximized "Maxinquaye"s cross-genre potential". According to Reynolds and <a href="Joy%20Press">Joy Press</a>, while "most post-rock 'n' roll forms of popular music ideologically rest on rebellions against <a href="Femininity">the feminine</a>", Tricky "utilized the feminine to construct his rebellion against the strict categories of black identity and music". The musician later explained that he simply believed feminine men were much more interesting than masculine men.

"Maxinquaye" was released on 20 February 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies in its first few months of release in the UK, despite no significant radio airplay. The record charted for 35 weeks on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">British albums chart</a>, peaking at number three. After it was released in the US on April 18, Tricky toured the country as a supporting act for fellow English recording artist <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a>. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, the album had sold 222,000 copies in the US by 2003. By 2012, it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. That same year, Tricky performed the entire album with Topley-Bird on April 27 at the Sundance London festival, which was their first onstage appearance together in 15 years.

"Maxinquaye" received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics. In a review for "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>", <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a> called it a very ambitious and musically audacious work that brilliantly explored the disparities in Britain's <a href="social%20structure">social structure</a>, with Topley-Bird as the "dominant voice" articulating Tricky's vision of uncertainty in an ever-changing world. Dele Fadele from "NME" said the record was unprecedented, spellbinding, and revealed something new with every listen. He found Tricky's production innovative and his fusion of various sounds so seamless, "you can't label the results under any existing genre". David Bennun of "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" deemed the album almost perfect and Tricky's music highly "gripping, original, sublime, his lyrics so abstruse and woven into the sound, that they become inseparable". "Maxinquaye"s combination of "dreamlike <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> and hip-hop bite" was praised by "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" critic <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> for giving Tricky's "soundscapes about contemporary life such a seductive and provocative edge". In "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine, Tom Doyle credited Topley-Bird's singing for making "Maxinquaye" "a highly inventive and intoxicating collection" while declaring that "with this debut, Tricky proves himself to be more challenging and eclectic than his peers".

Along with "Blue Lines", "Maxinquaye" was hailed by journalists as the pivotal release in what they were calling "<a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a>" music; <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a>, the chief critic at "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", called it the genre's "first album-length masterpiece". Tricky disliked the term, saying "I was supposed to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for "Stylus Magazine", Hebert argued that "there's too much here to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one ... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is so much better than that." In "Mojo", Victoria Segal later called "Maxinquaye" "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was also dubbed "the British <a href="Postmodernism">postmodern</a> album of the 90s" by Jason Draper of "<a href="Record%20Collector">Record Collector</a>" and "a visionary <a href="post-rock">post-rock</a> statement" by "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>"s <a href="Tom%20Moon">Tom Moon</a>, while <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> senior editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> said it remains "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of "noise and experimental music". For "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" in 1998, Christgau said the album's enduring significance lies in an aesthetic of <a href="cool%20%28aesthetic%29">cool</a> derived from the <a href="blues">blues</a> and <a href="African-American%20culture">African-American culture</a>, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression.

"Maxinquaye" was named 1995's best record in year-end polls by several English publications, including "NME", "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" and "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>", and finished second in the voting for the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics. The record also received a nomination for the 1995 <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a>, an annual music award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland, losing out to Portishead's 1994 debut "<a href="Dummy%20%28album%29">Dummy</a>". It was later ranked high in a "Q"-published poll determining the 100 greatest British albums, "Mojo"s "100 Modern Classics", and "Rolling Stone"s "Essential Recordings of the 90s", among other lists. Since then, "Maxinquaye" has frequently appeared on authoritative lists of the greatest records ever, including <a href="NME%27s%20The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">"NME"s 2013 list of the 500 greatest albums</a>, which ranked it 202nd best. "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" named it 156th best on a similar list in 2016. It was ranked 66th on "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"s list of the 100 best albums from the 1990s, with guest writer <a href="Rollie%20Pemberton">Rollie Pemberton</a> crediting the record for helping shape "the landscapes of modern electronica and <a href="underground%20hip-hop">underground hip-hop</a>". "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" named it the 21st greatest <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> album of the 20th century and wrote that along with "Blue Lines" and "Dummy", it was also "one of the most influential trip-hop albums of the '90s". According to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, "Maxinquaye" is the 153rd most prominently ranked record on critics' all-time lists. It was also included in the music reference book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>"; journalist Alex Rayner wrote in an accompanying chapter that the "innovative, thought provoking, and intricately arranged" album played a significant role in popularising <a href="British%20hip%20hop">British hip hop</a> and <a href="spoken%20word">spoken word</a> music in the UK.

Hygeberht

Hygeberht (died after 803) was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lichfield">Bishop of Lichfield</a> from 779 and Archbishop of Lichfield after the elevation of Lichfield to an <a href="archdiocese">archdiocese</a> some time after 787, during the reign of the powerful <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Mercia">Mercian king</a> <a href="Offa%20of%20Mercia">Offa</a>. Little is known of Hygeberht's background, although he was probably a native of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>.

Offa succeeded in having Lichfield elevated to an archbishopric, but the rise in Lichfield's status was unpopular with <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, the other southern English archbishopric. Offa was probably motivated by a desire to increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom's archbishopric, and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa's successor, which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed. After Offa's death his distant relative <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf</a> became king, and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric. The pope agreed to do so in 803, by which time Hygeberht was no longer even considered a bishop: he is listed as an abbot at the council that oversaw the demotion of Lichfield in 803. The date of his death is unknown.

Nothing is known of Hygeberht's ancestry or his upbringing, but given his close ties to the kingdom of Mercia, he was probably a Mercian by birth. He became Bishop of Lichfield in 779. At a Mercian council he attended that year at <a href="Hartleford">Hartleford</a> he was styled "electus praesul", or "bishop elect". Two years later he witnessed a charter of Offa's concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in Worcester.

Perhaps as early as 786 the creation of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of <a href="J%C3%A6nberht">Jænberht</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the <a href="Synod%20of%20Chelsea">Council of Chelsea</a> held in 787, Offa secured the creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the <a href="diocese%20of%20Lichfield">diocese of Lichfield</a> (in modern <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.

An archbishopric in Mercia would also reinforce the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury in the kingdom of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. Jænberht supported the Kentish king <a href="Egbert%20II%20of%20Kent">Egbert II</a>, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when <a href="Ecgbert%20%28bishop%29">Ecgbert</a> became the first <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>.

Two different versions of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" record the proceedings of the council. The <a href="Peterborough%20Chronicle">Peterborough Manuscript (Version E)</a> of the "Chronicle" records the council under the year 785, although the events took place in 787, and states that "here there was a contentious synod at Chelsea and Archbishop Jænberht relinquished some part of his bishopric, and Hygeberht was chosen by King Offa, and Ecgfrith consecrated as king." The <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle%23History%20of%20the%20manuscripts">Canterbury Manuscript (Version F)</a> has the council under 785 also, and describes the council as "a full synod sat at Chelsey" but otherwise relates much the same events. The historian <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> sees the coupling of the elevation of Lichfield with the consecration of Ecgfrith, who was Offa's son, as significant. He argues that Offa desired to have Ecgfrith consecrated as his successor during Offa's lifetime, but was unable to get Jænberht to agree, and this was another factor in the creation of Lichfield as an archbishopric. Hygeberht consecrated Ecgfrith after Hygeberht's elevation to archiepiscopal status.

Offa vowed at the council to donate 365 <a href="mancus">mancus</a>es each year to the papacy, to provide for poor people in Rome and to provide lights for <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>, stated to be a thanks-offering for his victories. C. J. Godfrey has argued that the donation was really in return for the papal approval of Offa's scheme to elevate the diocese of Lichfield to an archdiocese. Whatever Offa's motivation, historians have generally seen the gift as the beginning of <a href="Peter%27s%20Pence">Peter's Pence</a>, an annual "tax" paid to Rome by the English Church.

Although it appears that the Council of Chelsea approved Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There is no indication that he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.

In 788 Hygeberht traveled to Rome and received a <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from Pope <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20I">Hadrian I</a>. In one surviving <a href="charter">charter</a> of 788 Hygeberht is listed with the title of bishop, but another from late 788 gives him the title of archbishop. More charters from 789 and 792 also give him the title of archbishop, and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799.

Throughout the early part of Hygeberht's episcopate, Jænberht of Canterbury was the senior archbishop and enjoyed precedence, although after Jænberht's death in 792 Hygeberht became the foremost prelate in southern England. It is unknown if Jænberht ever acknowledged Hygeberht's elevation as an archbishop, but there is no evidence that Jænberht contested the division of his archiepiscopal see and the creation of another archbishopric. Hygeberht consecrated Jænberht's successor <a href="%C3%86thelhard">Æthelhard</a>, after Offa consulted <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin of York</a> about proper procedure. Hygeberht then was considered the senior prelate in the south of England, as shown by him being listed before Æthelhard in any charters they both appear on.

Canterbury retained as <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragans</a>, or subordinates, the bishops of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne%20%28historic%29">Sherborne</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Selsey</a>, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rochester">Rochester</a>, and <a href="Diocese%20of%20London">London</a>. The dioceses of <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">Worcester</a>, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Hereford</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Leicester">Leicester</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Lindsey</a>, <a href="Dommoc">Dommoc</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Elmham</a> were transferred to Lichfield. This listing, however, comes from the "<a href="Gesta%20pontificum%20Anglorum">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</a>" of the later medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, written in about 1120. Although the division is logical, William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht's successor <a href="Ealdwulf%20of%20Lichfield">Ealdwulf</a>, and does not give a source for his list, which suggest that it may be untrustworthy. The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial, and the community at Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that there were always some in the Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese.

During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for the provinces of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual procedure was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; they may have been a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.

Offa died in July 796 and his son Ecgfrith 141 days later. Coenwulf, a distant relative, succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith's death. Soon after his accession Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London, arguing that Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory I</a>'s original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury. In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope <a href="Pope%20Leo%20III">Leo III</a>, suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for Æthelhard. The king's envoys laid the blame for the problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I's incompetence. Displeased by criticism of the papacy, Leo ruled against the king's plan. In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion, allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric. Finally, in 802, Pope Leo III granted that Hadrian's decision was invalid, after the English clergy told him it had been achieved by Offa's misrepresentation. Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury, a decision announced by Æthelhard at the <a href="Councils%20of%20Clovesho%23Fifth%20Council">Council of Clovesho</a> in 803.

Hygeberht had resigned his see before Lichfield was demoted back to a bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests that he no longer controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown.

Hygeberht's contemporary at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected. The historian <a href="Eric%20John">Eric John</a> argues that this custom began because of the creation of the archbishopric of Lichfield.

Persuasion (1995 film)

Persuasion is a 1995 <a href="period%20drama">period drama</a> film directed by <a href="Roger%20Michell">Roger Michell</a> and based on <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s 1817 <a href="Persuasion%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. In her theatrical film debut, the British actress <a href="Amanda%20Root">Amanda Root</a> stars as protagonist <a href="Anne%20Elliot">Anne Elliot</a>, while <a href="Ciar%C3%A1n%20Hinds">Ciarán Hinds</a> plays her romantic interest, Captain <a href="Frederick%20Wentworth%20%28Persuasion%29">Frederick Wentworth</a>. The film is set in 19th century England, eight years after Anne was persuaded by others to reject Wentworth's proposal of marriage. "Persuasion" follows the two as they become reacquainted with each other, while supporting characters threaten to interfere.

The film was adapted by the writer <a href="Nick%20Dear">Nick Dear</a>, who considered the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised it as one of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. "Persuasion" was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.

Originally the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> was the sole producer of "Persuasion", until it partnered with the American company <a href="WGBH-TV">WGBH Boston</a> and the French company <a href="Millesime">Millesime</a>. This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel, including <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. Michell believed this was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical. While directing, he avoided what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer <a href="Alexandra%20Byrne">Alexandra Byrne</a> produced clothing that appeared "lived-in", winning a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Craft%20Awards">BAFTA</a> for her efforts.

"Persuasion" was filmed during a period of popularity for Austen's works; it was one of six adaptations of her novels produced during the mid-1990s. The film originally aired on 16 April 1995, when it broadcast on the British television channel <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a> released the film in American cinemas on 27 September 1995, as Austen's increasing popularity became apparent to Hollywood. "Persuasion"s cinematic release attracted the attention of film critics, and it received generally positive reviews, with many praising Root's performance. Film scholars have since observed significant changes from the source material, as well as class and gender themes.

The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft (<a href="John%20Woodvine">John Woodvine</a>), and a <a href="Horse%20and%20buggy">buggy</a> carrying Mr. Shepherd (<a href="David%20Collings">David Collings</a>) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (<a href="Felicity%20Dean">Felicity Dean</a>) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (<a href="Corin%20Redgrave">Corin Redgrave</a>), while Croft discusses the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain <a href="fop">fop</a>pish <a href="baronet">baronet</a>, is faced with financial ruin unless he <a href="Retrenchment">retrenches</a>. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> while the hall is <a href="Renting">let</a>; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (<a href="Susan%20Fleetwood">Susan Fleetwood</a>), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent <a href="Anne%20Elliot">Anne</a> (<a href="Amanda%20Root">Amanda Root</a>).

Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of <a href="Frederick%20Wentworth%20%28Persuasion%29">Frederick Wentworth</a> (<a href="Ciar%C3%A1n%20Hinds">Ciarán Hinds</a>)—a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage eight years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (<a href="Sophie%20Thompson">Sophie Thompson</a>), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (<a href="Victoria%20Hamilton">Victoria Hamilton</a>), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (<a href="Roger%20Hammond%20%28actor%29">Roger Hammond</a> and <a href="Judy%20Cornwell">Judy Cornwell</a>).

Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son. The following morning at breakfast, Anne and Mary are suddenly met briefly by Wentworth, the first time he and Anne have seen each other since she rejected him. Anne later hears that Wentworth thought her so altered that he "would not have known [her] again". Louisa and Henrietta begin to pursue marriage with Wentworth, as the family is unaware of his and Anne's past relationship. Hurt and rejected by Anne's refusal years before, Wentworth appears to court Louisa, much to Anne's chagrin. Later, Wentworth learns Anne also was persuaded by Lady Russell to refuse Charles' offer of marriage, after which Charles instead proposed to Mary. 

Anne, Wentworth, and the younger Musgroves go to <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme</a> and visit two of Wentworth's old naval friends, Captain Harville (<a href="Robert%20Glenister">Robert Glenister</a>) and Captain Benwick (<a href="Richard%20McCabe">Richard McCabe</a>). While there, Louisa rashly jumps off a staircase in the hopes Wentworth will catch her, sustaining a head injury. Afterwards, Anne goes to Bath to stay with her father and sister. Sir Walter and Elizabeth reveal they have repaired their relationship with a previously disreputable cousin, Mr. Elliot (<a href="Samuel%20West">Samuel West</a>), the heir to the Elliot baronetcy and estate. Anne is introduced to him, and they realise they briefly saw each other in Lyme. Much to Lady Russell's pleasure, Mr. Elliot begins to court Anne, but she remains uncertain of his true character. Meanwhile, Louisa has recovered and become engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth arrives in Bath and encounters Anne on several occasions, though their conversations are brief. 

Anne learns from an old friend, Mrs. Smith (<a href="Helen%20Schlesinger">Helen Schlesinger</a>), that Mr. Elliot is bankrupt and only interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.


The filming of "Persuasion" coincided with a sudden resurgence of <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> adaptations, as it was one of six such productions released during the mid-1990s. The media dubbed the phenomenon "Austenmania". While it was common for a successful adaptation to lead to the production of others, this surge in Austen's popularity involved many simultaneous projects—"Persuasion"s production, for instance, coincided with the TV serial "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281995%20TV%20series%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>" and the feature film "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%28film%29">Sense and Sensibility</a>". Despite the surge, film scholar Andrew Higson and others argue that there is little evidence that the various producers—who were employed by different companies—communicated when conceiving their adaptations.

The idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel "<a href="Persuasion%20%28novel%29">Persuasion</a>" began with the English producer <a href="Fiona%20Finlay%20%28producer%29">Fiona Finlay</a>, who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years. The novel had last been adapted by <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> in a <a href="Persuasion%20%281971%20TV%20series%29">1971 serial</a> starring <a href="Ann%20Firbank">Ann Firbank</a>. Finlay felt that the "very romantic" story was one "everyone can relate to. There's something very touching about long-lost love". She approached the writer <a href="Nick%20Dear">Nick Dear</a> about adapting it for television; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre, particularly his play about <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, "The Art of Success". Dear first suggested they try one of Austen's other works—either "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a>" or "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>"—but agreed to adapt "Persuasion" after reading it. Dear considered the novel—the author's last completed work—a maturer story than the others.

Dear later wrote that "Persuasion" was superficially "a love story in the <a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a> mould" but it was also one of "realism and truthfulness", particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. He spent two years working on a script, and found this task difficult for several reasons. First, he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel. Second, his protagonist barely spoke for the first half, and "therefore can't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does". Adapting Austen's wit was another challenge; much could not be used "because it's almost all in the author's voice telling us about characters, with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves. It's a craft job, interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it".

An experienced theatre and serial director, Roger Michell was chosen to direct "Persuasion", in what was to be his first feature film. As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. "I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper", he said. His attraction to "Persuasion" was based on his belief that it was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical. He described the work as an "erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning". While directing, Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen's story, seen for instance between "the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm, wet feel of Uppercross". The Royal Navy was another point of interest, as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories. The director wished to depict the integration of cultures, as naval officers came back with "an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before".

Root made her theatrical film debut playing Anne Elliot, the film's protagonist. According to Root, "every actress in England" read for the part. Having worked with the director previously on the 1993 TV serial "<a href="The%20Buddha%20of%20Suburbia%20%28TV%20serial%29">The Buddha of Suburbia</a>", Root won the role by writing him a letter to gain an audition. The character was described to Root as "haggard", which attracted the actress. "I relish a job like this, starting off downtrodden and gradually blossoming", she said. <a href="WGBH-TV">WGBH Boston</a>, the American company co-producing the film, had wanted a better known actress for the part but agreed to Root's casting after seeing Root's <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>.

Root came to realise that while the novel's narrative style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much of the time. I couldn't even think about technique, I just had to keep looking at the [novel] and then somehow radiate the feelings". "Persuasion" was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see "what a difference [her character's] sense of unhappiness can create", as by the end of the film Anne is "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>, which included her portrayal of <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a "competent leader of men in his profession", he was "socially inept" in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on "The Buddha of Suburbia". She died soon after filming; "Persuasion" was her last film role.

Michell attempted to be as faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th century. The director explained, "I was desperately trying to make it feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, "I basically didn't wear any makeup [in the film], and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.

The film's costume design was overseen by <a href="Alexandra%20Byrne">Alexandra Byrne</a>, who created clothing that appeared "lived-in" and "realistic". Like Fleetwood, Byrne had also worked with Michell on "The Buddha of Suburbia". It was her first time designing period costumes for film. During shooting, the crew often had to compete for costumes and props with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> production "Pride and Prejudice", which was being filmed at the same time. "Persuasion"s crew consequently had to send for replacement items from Italy and Australia. For her work in the film, Byrne won a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Craft%20Awards">BAFTA</a> for Best Costume Design.

Louise Watson, writing for <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>, felt the film's costume and make-up help "convey the full Cinderella transformation of Austen's heroine. At first the undervalued family martyr, Anne is the wallflower who has lost her 'bloom'. Her loose-fitting costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth... As she regains her confidence, she blossoms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes sparkle and her features become animated". Paulette Richards argues that the film's "unreliable" male characters, such as Sir Walter, are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing. This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, who live in a culture where "real men" are expected to care little for their clothing. Conversely, the film's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms, which is a contrast to <a href="Bryan%20Marshall">Bryan Marshall</a>'s version of the character in the 1971 adaptation. This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters, allowing him to appear romantic but isolated. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film, writing that it accurately captures Austen's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy. The naval men's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms, in contrast to other adaptations of the novel.

As a BBC production, "Persuasion" originally received a budget of £750,000. The British broadcaster proposed a collaboration with the American <a href="public%20television">public television</a> station <a href="WGBH-TV">WGBH Boston</a>, a partnership that had also produced the American anthology television series "<a href="Masterpiece%20%28TV%20series%29">Masterpiece Theatre</a>" as well as literary adaptations like the serial "Pride and Prejudice". <a href="Rebecca%20Eaton">Rebecca Eaton</a>, executive producer of "Masterpiece Theatre", approved the co-production as she had a preference for "Persuasion" out of all Austen's novels. The decision led to additional funding. Eaton would cite "Persuasion" as a successful example of WGBH using its small budget to invest in television projects, though she later expressed regret that the adaptation was two hours rather than a "luscious" six-part miniseries. Additionally, the French company Millesime co-produced the film in exchange for airing it on television in France. This decision further increased funding to £1,000,000. <a href="Mobil%20Oil%20Corporation">Mobil Oil Corporation</a>, a major sponsor of "Masterpiece Theatre", co-produced the film.

The diverse sources of funding meant that the production team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with certain aspects of the story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but you do want to see something like a kiss", she said.

In comparison to its adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s, the BBC provided increased funding for many of its productions in the 1990s. "Persuasion" consequently benefited, allowing it to frequently film on-location in places including <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, and in the south-eastern English countryside. Both Lyme and Bath are prominent locales in Austen's novel. Dear desired the opening sequence be on board a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ship of the period, but the only authentic vessel available was <a href="HMS%20Victory">HMS "Victory"</a>. It was <a href="Drydock">dry docked</a> as part of a museum in Portsmouth, and filming was only possible during short periods when the vessel was closed to the public. The final shot, in which Anne and Wentworth gaze into the ocean, was taken from the 1984 historical film "<a href="The%20Bounty%20%281984%20film%29">The Bounty</a>". The film's low budget also resulted in one of the opening shots, depicting Admiral Croft's ship on the ocean, being taken from "The Bounty". 

While Dear has received praise for "remarkably... retain[ing] most of the source novel's complex plot and numerous characters", literary scholars have noted significant differences between the film and the source material. Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character would never say in the novel. Morrison cites Anne's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith—where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative—in the film as an example, as "Austen's narrator makes it abundantly clear that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality". The film's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel, such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession. Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film, particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne's inner thoughts.

The film also expands upon Austen's subtle characterisation by exaggerating the emotions of characters and certain scenes. For example, in the novel during an early party Anne offers to play the pianoforte like usual; while doing so, she is slightly tearful but also "extremely glad to be employed" and "unobserved". Conversely, Dear's screenplay has Wentworth quickly giving up his seat to Anne and then immediately dancing with the Musgrove sisters, furthering the contrast between Anne and the others. According to David Monaghan, Austen's novel displays a "relatively radical vision" of societal change, such as the rise of a professional class challenging the old order of <a href="landed%20gentry">landed gentry</a>. Monaghan posits that this vision appealed to Dear and Michell, who used visuals and movement to emphasise this change. However, the two "deviate significantly" from the source material by depicting Anne and Wentworth as "single-mindedly oriented" to the future and thus 20th-century viewers' sensibilities.

<a href="Sue%20Parrill">Sue Parrill</a> observes that "Persuasion"s larger production budget, which allowed the crew to film much content on-location, "enabled the filmmakers to make fuller use of setting for symbolism and for creation of mood". The weather, for instance, is particularly important to Anne's state of mind in the novel. "Persuasion"s opening scenes establish its historical context, as well as the financial predicament in which the Elliot family finds itself. Indeed, for Rachel Brownstein, by opening the film with a depiction of sailors, the director is confronting a common complaint of Austen's works—her failure to mention the Napoleonic Wars. The juxtaposition between the navy and the Elliots establishes their differences, with the former group discussing the fall of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> and the latter group discussing the relatively minor inconvenience of overspending.

In his introduction to the published screenplay, Dear said he was in part attracted to adapt "Persuasion" because it depicted a "world in transition". To him, the novel showed "an old order fading away into decadence, and a new tribe, a meritocracy, coming to the fore". While directing, Roger Michell felt that the story included "the prototype of the postmodern family"—Anne's mother is dead, her father is bankrupt, and "the old social orders are breaking down". Root described Anne as a "feminist in a prefeminist period" and a "strong, independent character", to whom modern viewers can relate despite the story's period setting.

Austen scholars have studied the film's intersection with class and social change. Carole M. Dole notes that, among the many productions of Austen's work that appeared in the 1990s, "Persuasion" was the only one to "insistently draw attention to class issues", and "provide striking visual testimony to the workings of the British class system". The film, she adds, accomplishes this in part by focusing on the servants' faces, gauging their negative reactions to events. Richards, too, finds Michell "visually more aware" of the lower classes, adding that the film's inclusion of black servants alludes to the "colonial sources of wealth" supporting those superior in class and rank. Anne-Marie Scholz writes that the film and Emma Thompson's "Sense and Sensibility" both highlight the theme of class, but in different ways. Unlike "Sense and Sensibility", "Persuasion" depicts general class divisions rather than just how the working class impacts the protagonists—the camera focuses on the faces and expressions of servants and working people, personifying them.

In Michell's opinion, Austen was a "<a href="Protofeminism">proto-feminist</a>" who possessed a "clear-sighted vision of the ways the world is tilted against women". As evidence, Michell cites a book scene in which Anne discusses how songs and proverbs about women's fickleness were all written by men. Scholz argues that Anne's marginal status as a woman in the film is linked to that of the servants; the parallel between class and gender is conveyed with Anne's trip to Uppercross in a cart containing animals. Julianne Pidduck adds that the director "pointedly foregrounds themes of class and gendered social constraint by juxtaposing the stuffy interiors of mannered society with the inviting, open horizons of the sea". As an example, Pidduck discusses Anne's stay in a gated residence in Bath, where she gazes out of an upper story window in search for Wentworth on the streets below. To her, Wentworth and the sea represent freedom and possibility.

"Persuasion" premiered on 16 April 1995, <a href="Easter%20Day">Easter Day</a>, on the British television channel <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. An estimated 3.8 million viewers watched the production. BBC Two aired it again on 25 December, <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a>. It also later aired on the American television channel <a href="PBS">PBS</a> on 6 April 1997.

Near the end of filming, Rebecca Eaton noticed the growing "buzz" surrounding Austen and costume dramas in Hollywood. WGBH had never made a theatrical film before, but "decided to try its luck on the big screen". <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a> saw a cut of the adaptation and requested permission to show it in American cinemas, releasing it on 27 September 1995. There, it was characterised as an "<a href="Art%20film">art-house</a>" film, with a small <a href="Niche%20market">niche audience</a>. It was shown at the <a href="1995%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto</a> and <a href="Chicago%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chicago International Film Festival</a>s. "Persuasion" earned $56,000 in its first week of release in New York, and grossed $150,000 in Los Angeles. The total US gross was $5,269,757. It was less financially successful than the popular "Sense and Sensibility", which was released in cinemas several months later. The film was released in <a href="VHS">VHS</a> format on 12 November 1996; a DVD version followed on 1 February 2000.

Upon its release, "Persuasion" at first failed to attract many critical reviews. This changed when "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility" were released in late 1995 to great success in the UK. Their reception lifted the earlier film out of obscurity, as Austen's popularity became apparent among critics. "Persuasion" garnered highly positive reviews from major film critics, and critical review website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> has since calculated a rating of 85%, which refers to the percentage of positive reviews. Caryn James of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" deemed it a "critic's pick", praising "a cast completely in sync with Austen's warm but piercing style". Jay Carr of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" highlighted Root's performance, calling it "a heart-stoppingly reticent yet glorious debut".

In a contribution for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", Desson Howe said "there's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about "Persuasion"...as if everyone concerned with the production knows that, if given time and patience, Austen's genius will emerge. Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways". Writing for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", critic <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> graded the film with an "A–", saying it "should enthral even those who haven't read" the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's "crown jewel" for playing a "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance". In 2008, James Rampton of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time.

When reviewing, film critics often compared the respective adaptations of "Persuasion" and "Sense and Sensibility". Thompson's film received more recognition and <a href="List%20of%20accolades%20received%20by%20Sense%20and%20Sensibility%20%28film%29">accolades</a> from Hollywood, while Michell's production gained the admiration of <a href="up-market">up-market</a> critics, who felt it was a more authentic and thoughtful representation of Austen's world. <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "The New York Times", for instance, wrote that "Sense and Sensibility" "can't match the brilliant incisiveness of the more spartan "Persuasion," still the most thoughtful new Austen adaptation". The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" characterised "Persuasion" as "the most authentically British version and the one closest to the spirit of the novels" and "Sense and Sensibility" as "the audience-friendly Hollywood version of Austen, easygoing and aiming to please". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named them both the best films of 1995, referring to "Persuasion" as "reserved" and "Sense and Sensibility" as "more bustling". Higson, when analysing both productions, felt "Persuasion" captured a sense of "gritty realism" that would influence such later Austen adaptations as "<a href="Mansfield%20Park%20%28film%29">Mansfield Park</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Becoming%20Jane">Becoming Jane</a>" (2007).

George Macaulay

George Gibson Macaulay (7 December 1897 – 13 December 1940) was a professional English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a> between 1920 and 1935. He played in eight <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> from 1923 to 1933, achieving the rare feat of taking a wicket with his first <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">ball</a> in Test cricket. One of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1924, he took 1,838 first-class <a href="Wicket%23dismissal">wickets</a> at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 17.64 including four <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-tricks</a>.

A leading member of the Yorkshire team which achieved a high level of success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a>. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.

Macaulay was born in <a href="Thirsk">Thirsk</a> on 7 December 1897. His father was a well-known local cricketer, as were his uncles. Macaulay was educated at <a href="Barnard%20Castle%20School">Barnard Castle</a>; in later years, he took teams of famous cricketers to play annual matches against the school eleven. Upon leaving school, he worked as a bank clerk in <a href="Wakefield">Wakefield</a>; there, and in nearby <a href="Ossett">Ossett</a>, he played cricket and football. In the First World War, Macaulay served with the <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a>; afterwards he returned to work for the same bank as before, initially in London, then in <a href="Herne%20Bay%2C%20Kent">Herne Bay, Kent</a>, playing club cricket in his spare time.

In 1920, <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> needed to strengthen its bowling attack. Of the team's previously successful bowlers, <a href="Major%20Booth">Major Booth</a> had been killed in the war, <a href="Alonzo%20Drake">Alonzo Drake</a> had died soon afterwards from illness, and <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> was past his best. Although <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> was able to ease the shortfall by resuming his career as a frontline <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowler</a>, Yorkshire needed new bowlers, particularly <a href="fast%20bowlers">pacemen</a>. Macaulay had been spotted playing club cricket by Sir <a href="Stanley%20Christopherson">Stanley Christopherson</a>, a former <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> player. Subsequently, <a href="Harry%20Hayley">Harry Hayley</a>, a 19th-century Yorkshire cricketer, saw Macaulay in action and was sufficiently impressed to recommend him for a trial with the county. At the beginning of the <a href="1920%20English%20cricket%20season">1920 season</a>, Macaulay played in two warm-up games for Yorkshire, taking six <a href="wicket%20%28cricket%29">wickets</a> for 52 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> in a one-day game and four for 24 and two for 19 in a two-day game. This was good enough to earn a first-class debut on 15 May 1920 against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>, although he only took one wicket. Playing in the early part of the season, he took five wickets for 50 runs, his first <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">five wicket haul</a>, against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>, followed by six for 47 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. He continued to play until the middle of June before dropping out of the team after an unsuccessful match against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. In ten first-class matches, he had taken 24 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 24.35, and managed a top score of just 15 with the bat. "Wisden" said he "had neither the pace nor the stamina required", while it later said he tried to bowl at speeds beyond his capability. Even so, he decided to become a professional cricketer. Hirst and Rhodes persuaded him to reduce his pace and concentrate on bowling a <a href="line%20and%20length">good length</a> while trying to spin the ball. He practised through the winter of 1920–21 to be ready for the next season.

Bowling a mixture of medium pace and his new style of <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets steadily at the start of the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a big victory and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first-class <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. His innings of 125 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture%23Declaration">declared</a>, a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.

Macaulay improved his bowling record in 1922, taking more wickets at a lower average (133 wickets at an average of 14.67), and scoring another century. Helping Yorkshire to win the first of four County Championships in a row, Macaulay finished second to Rhodes in the team's bowling averages. The first two matches of the season brought Macaulay figures of six for eight and five for 23 in a ten wicket win over <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> and six for 12 out of an opposition total of 78 in an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings win</a> over <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>. While he took only one wicket in the second innings, his first three innings had given him 17 wickets for 43 runs. He continued to pick up wickets, but his most significant performance came in June. In front of <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) members at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, he took five for 31 as <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> were bowled out for 138. Those watching were impressed and he was selected for <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">the Players against the Gentlemen</a> at the same ground in July. He took three for 97 out of a total of 430 in one of the most important matches of the season. These performances earned his selection for the MCC tour to South Africa that winter, although there were concerns his fitness was insufficient. Statistically, Macaulay's best performance came shortly afterwards against Gloucestershire; he took seven for 47 and twelve wickets in the match. Macaulay also scored 486 runs at an average of 17.35.

Macaulay played eight first-class matches in South Africa in 1922–23, taking 29 wickets at an average of 16.37. His best first-class performances were six for 18 against Pretoria and eight wickets in the match against <a href="Transvaal%20cricket%20team">Transvaal</a>, while he was effective in minor matches, taking five for 40 against East Rand and six for 19 against Zululand. After England lost the first Test match, which "Wisden" attributed to a weakness in bowling, Macaulay replaced <a href="Greville%20Stevens">Greville Stevens</a> and made his <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> debut for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> in the second Test. He took the wicket of <a href="George%20Alfred%20Lawrence%20Hearne">George Hearne</a> with his first <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">ball</a>. He was the fourth player to take a wicket with his maiden delivery in Test cricket. In total, he took two for 19 in the first innings. In the second innings, South Africa were comfortably placed with a score of 157 for one, but four wickets fell to Macaulay while 13 runs were scored. Macaulay ended the innings with five wickets for 64. "Wisden" commented that he bowled very finely in this match. He hit the winning run, batting at number eleven, to seal a one-wicket win for England. He played in the remaining three Tests, finishing with 16 wickets at an average of 20.37. England won the series 2–1, but the "Wisden" correspondent for the tour was not impressed by the English performances, noting that no really effective bowlers had emerged.
With his health improved by the tour, "Wisden" reported that Macaulay was in excellent form for the whole of the 1923 season. His performances earned him selection as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation praised his stamina, spin and ability to bowl on all kinds of <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitches</a> but noted that he was easily discouraged and had a negative attitude if circumstances went against him. He achieved his highest season total of wickets to date, taking 166 at an average of 13.84, and came third in both the Yorkshire and national bowling averages. His best performance came in the first match of the season, when he took seven wickets for 13 against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> as they were dismissed for 63. Later in the season, he took a <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a> against Warwickshire while claiming five for 42. With the bat, Macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18.52. There were no international matches that season, but Macaulay was selected for The Rest in a Test trial against England in which he took just one wicket.

In 1924, Macaulay further increased his total of wickets to 190 and lowered his bowling average to 13.23, placing him first in the national averages. His batting declined as he scored 395 runs at an average of 11.96. Although selected for another Test trial, Macaulay did not play in the series against the touring South African team until the third Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium%23Headingley%20Carnegie%20Cricket%20Ground">Leeds</a>, where he took one wicket in each South African innings, but was omitted from the final two Tests. Despite his success in the season, he was not chosen to tour Australia with the MCC that winter, even though <a href="Maurice%20Tate">Maurice Tate</a>, the leading bowler on the tour, lacked support. Macaulay had been involved in controversy on the field in 1924. At the time, the Yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding. In a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield, the hostility of the crowd provoked an MCC inquiry which found that Yorkshire bowler <a href="Abe%20Waddington">Abe Waddington</a> had incited the spectators. Further incidents followed against Surrey. The editor of "Wisden" blamed Yorkshire's poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players. Without naming Macaulay as one of them, he noted that <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>, the Yorkshire president, believed Macaulay should have been in the team to Australia, and that "it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen". It is also possible that during a match at this time, Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a>, the England captain.

Since 1923, Macaulay had run a cricket <a href="outfitter">outfitter</a>s in Leeds and Wakefield with his Yorkshire team-mate <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>, borrowing £250 from his mother to help establish the business. During the winter of 1924–25, the shop became a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> and Macaulay one of its directors. According to Sutcliffe's biographer Alan Hill, Macaulay quickly lost interest, and the partnership was dissolved a year later, but Sutcliffe made the lone venture a success. Macaulay received £900 from the outfitters upon his resignation.

Macaulay's most successful season in terms of wickets was 1925, despite a very dry summer which produced a succession of good batting pitches. He took 211 wickets at an average of 15.48, coming top of the Yorkshire averages. Exactly 200 of his wickets were taken for Yorkshire—only Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst had previously reached 200 wickets for Yorkshire, and only <a href="Bob%20Appleyard">Bob Appleyard</a> has done so since, as of 2013. One of Macaulay's highest profile performances in 1925 came for Yorkshire against Sussex, who were chasing 263 to win the game. Just after <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">lunch</a> on the final day, the score was 223 for three wickets. A possibly apocryphal story suggests that Macaulay drank champagne in the interval. He then delivered a <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">spell</a> of five wickets for eight runs in 33 balls to bowl out his opponents and finish with figures of seven for 67. He then left the field exhausted. The cricket historian Mick Pope describes the match as a "lasting testimony to [Macaulay's] belief that no cause was ever lost". Macaulay was again selected for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, and took five wickets in the match. With the bat, Macaulay scored 621 runs at an average of 23.88, although he only passed fifty twice.

Yorkshire's reign as County Champions ended in 1926, the first season since 1921 when Yorkshire did not win the Championship. "Wisden" noted that the Yorkshire attack, with the exception of Rhodes, was less effective than previously. Macaulay bowled less overs and took fewer wickets at a higher bowling average; his 134 wickets, at an average of 17.78, placed him second in the Yorkshire averages. Selected for a Test trial, he failed to take a wicket. "Wisden" described his performance as "lifeless", while cricket writer <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> noted that he had "yet again ... fallen below his best away from the Yorkshire XI". He was not chosen for the Gentlemen v Players match, never representing the Players again.

Macaulay was selected for the third Test against Australia at Headingley, possibly because <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a>, the England captain, expected the pitch to favour spinners. The Australians were concerned that Macaulay represented a threat to their batting, but the match did not work out in Macaulay's favour as a bowler; having been dropped at the start of play, <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a> played what "Wisden" called one of the best innings of his career and vigorously attacked the England bowling, achieving the rare feat of scoring a century before the lunch interval. The Australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack Macaulay in particular, and the Yorkshire bowler suffered as Macartney quickly dominated him. Macaulay eventually had Macartney caught after hitting a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short ball</a> in the air, but it was Macaulay's only success in the innings. Macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as Australia scored 494. When Macaulay came into bat from number ten in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting order</a>, England were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat. He played an attacking innings of 76, hitting ten fours, in a partnership of 108 with <a href="George%20Geary">George Geary</a>. This began an England recovery which helped the team to escape with a draw. Nevertheless, Macaulay did not play in the final two Tests of the series. Later in the season, he took fourteen wickets for 92 runs against Gloucestershire, including eight for 43 in the second innings. These were the best bowling figures of his career that he achieved in a match. Apart from his batting success in the Test match, Macaulay scored another two fifties and in the match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> achieved a century.

Over the next four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, although they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly after the death of <a href="Roy%20Kilner">Roy Kilner</a> in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.

In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at an average of 18.26. However, he suffered a foot injury in 1928, and took time to recover his best form. His wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24.37. His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets for the first time since his debut season; his average of 25.12 was the highest of his career. In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket. At the same time, his batting faded. In 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs at an average of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929.

From the 1931 season, Yorkshire once again dominated the County Championship, winning three consecutive trophies. A large part of the success was an increase in bowling strength. In 1931, Macaulay slightly increased his haul of wickets from 91 to 97, and his average dropped from 25.12 to 15.75. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages, behind <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a> and <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a>, who both took over 100 wickets and led a very strong bowling attack. That season, Macaulay was awarded a <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> against Surrey which raised £1,633, worth approximately £82,700 in 2008. At the time, this was considered a poor reward for a Yorkshire cricketer. The following season, Macaulay took fewer wickets, managing 84 at an average of 19.07, which placed him fifth in the Yorkshire averages. He achieved his best bowling figures in first-class cricket when he took eight for 21 against the <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">Indian touring side</a>. By now, Macaulay was a specialist spinner and had largely abandoned pace bowling; <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Rhodes%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Rhodes</a> opened the Yorkshire bowling.

The 1933 season signalled a return to form for Macaulay. "Wisden" judged that he "recovered fully his length, spin and command over variations in pace". He bowled more overs than anyone else in the team and passed 100 wickets for the first time since 1929, the tenth and final time he did so, taking 148 wickets at an average of 16.45. Against Northamptonshire, he took seven for nine as the team was bowled out for 27. He finished the match with thirteen for 34. Against Lancashire, when his match figures were twelve for 49, he took a hat-trick in a sequence of four wickets in five balls; he also took twelve wickets against Leicestershire. His form won a recall to the Test side after seven years. Not picked initially, a decision described by "Wisden" as unfair, he played in the first Test when <a href="Edward%20Clark%20%28cricketer%29">E. W. Clark</a> dropped out of the team before the match. Macaulay took one wicket in the first innings but had figures of four for 57 in the second innings to earn approval from "Wisden". He was picked for the second Test but bowled only 14 overs before injuring his foot when fielding; he was unable to take any further part in the game. He did not play in the third Test but was selected in festival game at Scarborough for the team selected from the MCC party which toured Australia in the previous winter. He played instead of an injured player, even though he did not take part in the tour. Macaulay ended second in the Yorkshire bowling averages. In its review of the season, "Wisden" stated that his form in the early part of the season would have placed his among the best cricketers in the world.

Macaulay's final two seasons were affected by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>. In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets at an average of 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of £250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; <a href="Frank%20Smailes">Frank Smailes</a> was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, but it was not until <a href="Ellis%20Robinson">Ellis Robinson</a> secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.

Macaulay ended his career with 1,837 first-class wickets at an average of 17.65. In eight Test matches, he took 24 of those wickets at an average of 27.58. In addition, he scored 6,055 runs at an average of 18.07 and held 373 catches. He took 100 wickets in a season ten times, a record only surpassed by four others for Yorkshire, while only three other Yorkshire bowlers have taken 200 wickets in a season. He also took four <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-tricks</a>.

Following his retirement, Macaulay initially attempted to market a patented rheumatic medicine, but the business quickly failed. He then established an athletic outfitting shop in Leeds. This business also was unsuccessful; Macaulay blamed a lack of money and competition from other businesses. Consequently, he filed for <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">bankruptcy</a> in 1937. Macaulay accused Yorkshire of worsening his situation by withholding most of his benefit money—of the total raised, he received only £530. He believed that he was owed the balance, and continued his business under that assumption, but Yorkshire had invested the amount and he only received the interest. The matter arose in court, and when asked why he thought the money would be paid to him, Macaulay answered: "Because I had earned it". He also rejected the accusation that he spent his time drinking in <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s, and another that he had neglected his two failed businesses. The <a href="Official%20Receiver">Official Receiver</a> found that Macaulay's complaint against Yorkshire was without justification. Macaulay suggested that he should arrange for the invested money to be paid to his creditors in his <a href="Will%20%28law%29">will</a>. Macaulay secured new employment, and a few days after the hearing it was announced that he would play professional cricket in Wales.

Macaulay played league cricket in Wales and Lancashire until the Second World War. During 1937, he was the professional at <a href="Ebbw%20Vale">Ebbw Vale cricket club</a>, and in 1938 and 1939, he played in the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a> as the professional for <a href="Todmorden%20Cricket%20Club">Todmorden</a>, for whom he took nine wickets for 10 runs against <a href="Ramsbottom%20Cricket%20Club">Ramsbottom</a> in the <a href="Worsley%20Cup">Worsley Cup</a> final. Ramsbottom were bowled out for 47 to give Macaulay's team a 26-run win.

When the Second World War began, Macaulay joined the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) Volunteer Reserve in 1940 as a <a href="Pilot%20Officer">Pilot Officer</a>, and was stationed at <a href="Church%20Fenton">Church Fenton</a>, close to <a href="Barkston%20Ash">Barkston Ash</a> where he lived with his wife Edith. Later in the year, he was stationed in the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>, where he was bothered by the cold. Six days after his 43rd birthday, he died of pneumonia at the <a href="Sullom%20Voe">Sullom Voe</a> RAF station on 13 December 1940. He was buried in <a href="Lerwick">Lerwick</a> Cemetery on <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>.

As a batsman, Macaulay was reasonably good and possibly better than his statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.

As a bowler, Macaulay fulfilled two roles. At the start of an innings, when the <a href="Cricket%20ball">ball</a> was new and hard, he <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Deployment%20of%20bowlers">opened the bowling</a> with <a href="fast%20bowling">medium-fast</a> deliveries that <a href="outswinger">swung away from</a> right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> considered him to be better than any similar bowler in the 1920s except <a href="Maurice%20Tate">Maurice Tate</a>, the leading medium paced bowler in England. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced <a href="Off%20spin">off breaks</a>. "Wisden" said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a <a href="Sticky%20wicket%23Origins">sticky wicket</a>, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: "Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy." This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, but at the same time it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that "on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory." He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that "only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle", and described Macaulay as a great bowler. The cricket writer <a href="Jim%20Kilburn">Jim Kilburn</a> suggested that Macaulay was "a great cricketer. He was great not so much in mathematical accomplishment ... as in cricketing character."

Macaulay's bowling action was relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his shoulders swaying, but his feet were faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball <a href="beamer%20%28cricket%29">straight at their head</a> without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart ... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The "<a href="Yorkshire%20Post">Yorkshire Post</a>", after his death, observed: "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm when there was a fighting chance of victory".

Macaulay displayed a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow described him as an unusual man, "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy ... A cricket-bag came between him and his blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years. <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".

U.S. Route 131

US Highway 131 (US 131) is a north–south <a href="United%20States%20Highway">United States Highway</a>, of which all but 0.64 of its 269.96 miles (1.03 of 434.46 km) are within the state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The highway starts in rural <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> south of the state line as a <a href="List%20of%20State%20Roads%20in%20Indiana">state road</a> connection to the <a href="Indiana%20Toll%20Road">Indiana Toll Road</a>. As the road crosses into Michigan it becomes a <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that connects to the metropolitan areas of <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> and <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> before continuing north to its terminus at <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a>. US 131 runs as a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> from south of <a href="Portage%2C%20Michigan">Portage</a> through to <a href="Manton%2C%20Michigan">Manton</a> in the north. Part of this freeway <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with <a href="Interstate%20296">Interstate 296</a> (I-296) as an <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned designation</a> through Grand Rapids. US 131 forms an important corridor along the western side of the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula of Michigan</a>, running through rural farm and forest lands as well as urban cityscapes. Various names have been applied to the roadway over the years. The oldest, the Mackinaw Trail, originated from an <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trail in the area while other names honored politicians. An attempt to dedicate the highway to poet <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a> failed to gain official support in Michigan.

The first state highways along the US 131 corridor were designated as early as 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US 131 was created along the route of <a href="M-13%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-13</a> in Michigan. Originally ending at <a href="Fife%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Fife Lake</a> on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments of the road to a full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from <a href="Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan">Three Rivers</a>, and heading both north and south from a point in southern <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a>. A third segment was built south of <a href="Cadillac%2C%20Michigan">Cadillac</a> and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed in the early part of the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two bridges formerly used by US 131 have been labeled by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) as historic structures; one of them has been listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP).

Plans to further extend the freeway have either been canceled or placed back under study. Upgrades on the north end through <a href="Kalkaska%2C%20Michigan">Kalkaska</a> ceased to be considered in 2000. South of Three Rivers, MDOT is studying possible upgrades to US 131. One option for these upgrades is a full freeway, an option that was initially rejected. The preferred alternative in 2008 was a two-lane bypass of <a href="Constantine%2C%20Michigan">Constantine</a> that opened in October 2013.

Running in Indiana and Michigan, US 131 in its entirety is listed as a part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a system of roads crucial to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. As a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> in both states, the roadway is maintained by the <a href="Indiana%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Indiana Department of Transportation</a> (INDOT) and MDOT. The Michigan section includes approximately of freeway between <a href="Kalamazoo%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> and <a href="Wexford%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wexford</a> counties.

US 131 extends through <a href="Elkhart%20County%2C%20Indiana">Elkhart County</a>, Indiana, between the entrance to the <a href="Indiana%20Toll%20Road">Indiana Toll Road</a>, a few hundred feet north of the Toll Road overpass, and the state line to the north. <a href="Indiana%20State%20Road%2013">State Road 13</a> (SR 13) <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with US 131 in this section but is not signposted. INDOT surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state's highways. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT), a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. The 2007 survey reported average daily traffic of 7,949 cars and 2,068 trucks.

As a state trunkline highway, US 131 runs approximately in Michigan, from the Indiana state line north to <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a>. The highway is an important link between <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> and the tourist areas of <a href="Northern%20Michigan">Northern Michigan</a>. The trunkline enters Michigan about three miles () south of <a href="White%20Pigeon%2C%20Michigan">White Pigeon</a>, crossing a branch of the <a href="Michigan%20Southern%20Railroad%20%281989%29">Michigan Southern Railroad</a> before meeting <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> on the west side of the village. The highway passes through rural farmland north to just south of <a href="Constantine%2C%20Michigan">Constantine</a>, where US 131 turns northwestward to bypass the downtown business district, crosses the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a> and continues north to <a href="Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan">Three Rivers</a>. The stretch of highway between Constantine and the start of the <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> south of Three Rivers averaged 7,579 cars and 1,045 trucks daily in 2009 according to MDOT, one of the lowest AADT counts for the highway in Michigan.

US 131 runs through a business corridor along the west side of Three Rivers. M-60 runs concurrently along this part of US 131 until the two highways meet the south end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan%29">the business loop</a> through town. The main road curves to the northeast as it leaves town, and M-60 turns east to follow Business US 131 (Bus. US 131) into downtown. The trunkline runs parallel to a branch of the <a href="Grand%20Elk%20Railroad">Grand Elk Railroad</a>. North of the other end of the business loop, US 131 follows a four-lane surface highway through rural farmland in northern <a href="St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph County</a>. The highway has <a href="grade%20separation">at-grade</a> junctions with cross roads, but otherwise has limited access from adjoining property. This arrangement ends on the south side of <a href="Schoolcraft%2C%20Michigan">Schoolcraft</a>, where the highway transitions to follow Grand Street through town. North of town US 131 returns to an expressway as the highway continues through southern Kalamazoo County farmland.

After an intersection with Shaver Road, US 131 widens into a full freeway which passes the <a href="Gourdneck%20State%20Game%20Area">Gourdneck State Game Area</a> as it enters the <a href="Kalamazoo%20metropolitan%20area">Kalamazoo metropolitan area</a>. US 131 meets <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> southwest of <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> and picks up the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a> (BL I-94) designation for a couple of miles. This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit 36 and follows <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan%29">US 131's business loop</a> along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan University</a>. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US 131 passes the northern end of Bus. US 131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US 131. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern <a href="Allegan%20County%2C%20Michigan">Allegan County</a>.

As US 131 passes through the outskirts of <a href="Plainwell%2C%20Michigan">Plainwell</a>, it curves to the northeast through a commercial area centered around the interchange with <a href="M-89%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-89</a>. North of this area US 131 crosses the <a href="Kalamazoo%20River">Kalamazoo River</a> and runs past the US 131 Raceway Park, a <a href="dragstrip">dragstrip</a> close to the <a href="M-222%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-222</a> interchange near <a href="Martin%2C%20Michigan">Martin</a>. The freeway continues north through mixed farm and forest land to the residential areas that abut it in <a href="Wayland%2C%20Michigan">Wayland</a>. Further north the highway crosses into <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a> and the southern end of the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20metropolitan%20area">Grand Rapids metropolitan area</a>.

As the freeway continues farther north, and closer to Grand Rapids, it is lined with more commercial and <a href="Light%20industry">light industrial</a> properties. The unincorporated suburb of <a href="Cutlerville%2C%20Michigan">Cutlerville</a> lies to the east as US 131 approaches <a href="M-6%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-6</a>, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in <a href="West%20Michigan">West Michigan</a>. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8 km) in width and over a mile (1.6 km) in length and encompasses 27 bridges and 18 retaining walls. US 131 continues north through the city of <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Michigan">Wyoming</a> to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a> (28th Street).
The freeway continues through the southern end of Grand Rapids, alongside residential areas until Burton Street. A large rail yard abuts the trunkline on the east, and the freeway turns northeasterly on its approach to downtown. At Wealthy Street, the freeway takes a sharp turn to the west to cross the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> and immediately turns back north on a bridge structure known as the S-Curve. The highest traffic volumes along US 131 are located north of this river crossing. In 2009, MDOT measured an AADT of 107,200 cars and 5,992 trucks through the stretch between Market Avenue and Pearl Street. The trunkline continues past the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Museum">Gerald R. Ford Museum</a> and the <a href="Public%20Museum%20of%20Grand%20Rapids">Public Museum of Grand Rapids</a> before the northbound <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a> crosses over, then back under, the southbound lanes, forcing traffic through this stretch to briefly <a href="Right-%20and%20left-hand%20traffic">drive on the left</a>. North of <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a>, US 131 picks up a second, <a href="unsigned%20highway">hidden designation</a> on highway inventory logs called <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a>, although the number is not signposted along the road. I-296/US 131 continues along the banks of the Grand River into <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a> where the hidden I-296 designation turns to the northwest along a series of ramps to <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> while US 131 curves to the northeast along a bend in the river. As it continues along the river the freeway passes through the unincorporated community of <a href="Comstock%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Comstock Park</a> and near to <a href="Fifth%20Third%20Ballpark">Fifth Third Ballpark</a>, home of the <a href="West%20Michigan%20Whitecaps">West Michigan Whitecaps</a> local <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> team.

The trunkline turns north, away from the river, as it nears the stadium and passes through the remainder of the northern suburb, changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County. <a href="M-46%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-46</a> joins US 131 from the west at <a href="Cedar%20Springs%2C%20Michigan">Cedar Springs</a> and the two highways pass into northwestern <a href="Montcalm%20County%2C%20Michigan">Montcalm County</a> near <a href="Sand%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Sand Lake</a>. North of <a href="Pierson%2C%20Michigan">Pierson</a> the landscape is dominated by forests. M-46 turns east and leaves the freeway near <a href="Howard%20City%2C%20Michigan">Howard City</a> while US 131 continues into <a href="Mecosta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Mecosta County</a> near the <a href="Little%20Muskegon%20River">Little Muskegon River</a>. The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the <a href="Manistee%20National%20Forest">Manistee National Forest</a> near the river and north to <a href="Big%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Big Rapids</a>. Further north <a href="M-20%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-20</a> joins the US 131 freeway near <a href="Stanwood%2C%20Michigan">Stanwood</a> and the two highways cross the <a href="Muskegon%20River">Muskegon River</a> on the way to Big Rapids. The city is served by <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Big%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">its own business loop</a> and M-20 turns east off the freeway along Bus. US 131 toward the main campus of <a href="Ferris%20State%20University">Ferris State University</a>. North of Big Rapids US 131 runs through rural <a href="Osceola%20County%2C%20Michigan">Osceola County</a> to a junction with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> at <a href="Reed%20City%2C%20Michigan">Reed City</a>.

Passing through rural Osceola County and providing access to rural communities such as <a href="Le%20Roy%2C%20Michigan">Le Roy</a> and <a href="Tustin%2C%20Michigan">Tustin</a>, US 131 approaches the south side of <a href="Cadillac%2C%20Michigan">Cadillac</a> in Wexford County. At exit 176, <a href="M-55%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-55</a> leaves a concurrency with <a href="M-115%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-115</a> and joins the US 131 freeway around the east side of Cadillac. This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Cadillac%2C%20Michigan%29">old routing</a> is now a business loop through downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit 180 while US 131 continues around the east side of Cadillac and north around the east side of <a href="Manton%2C%20Michigan">Manton</a>. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US 131, 7,455 cars and 709 trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Manton%2C%20Michigan%29">Manton's business loop</a>.

The two-lane highway runs through the <a href="Pere%20Marquette%20State%20Forest">Pere Marquette State Forest</a> and over the <a href="Manistee%20River">Manistee River</a>, crossing the southeast corner of <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20County%2C%20Michigan">Grand Traverse County</a>. It meets the southern end of <a href="M-113%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-113</a> in <a href="Walton%2C%20Michigan">Walton</a>, where it runs parallel to the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Central%20Railroad">Great Lakes Central Railroad</a>. Passing through <a href="Fife%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Fife Lake</a>, US 131 crosses into <a href="Kalkaska%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kalkaska County</a> and to <a href="South%20Boardman%2C%20Michigan">South Boardman</a>. The area around South Boardman is marked by farmland as the trunkline crosses the <a href="Boardman%20River">Boardman River</a> in the small unincorporated community. The road once again runs parallel to the railroad as it meets <a href="M-66%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-66</a>/<a href="M-72%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-72</a> south of <a href="Kalkaska%2C%20Michigan">Kalkaska</a>. The three highways join and run concurrently through downtown. North of town M-72 turns west toward <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City</a> and US 131/M-66 continues north through farmland into <a href="Antrim%20County%2C%20Michigan">Antrim County</a>. About north of town, standing on the west side of the road, is the Shoe Tree. A local icon since shortly after the turn of the 21st century, the origins of the landmark are unknown.

The trunkline follows the railroad into <a href="Antrim%2C%20Michigan">Antrim</a> and <a href="Mancelona%2C%20Michigan">Mancelona</a>. North of downtown Mancelona M-66 turns north toward <a href="Charlevoix%2C%20Michigan">Charlevoix</a> and US 131 continues along the <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a>, through <a href="Alba%2C%20Michigan">Alba</a>. <a href="M-32%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-32</a> follows US 131 for a half mile (0.8 km) near the community of <a href="Elmira%2C%20Michigan">Elmira</a>. As it continues farther north US 131 enters the <a href="Mackinaw%20State%20Forest">Mackinaw State Forest</a>. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US 131: 5,114 cars and 448 trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural <a href="Charlevoix%20County%2C%20Michigan">Charlevoix County</a> where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. As the highway enters the southern section of the city of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the <a href="Little%20Traverse%20Bay%20Indian%20Reservation">Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation</a> of the <a href="Odawa%20people">Odawa Indians</a>. At the northern terminus of US 131, US 31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north.

MDOT operates 67 <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a>s and 14 <a href="visitor%20center">welcome centers</a> in the state, all named in honor of retired department employees, although in some cases an honoree's name may be dropped from the rest area. Eight of these are along US 131, providing bathroom facilities, dog runs, picnic areas and usually vending machines. The rest areas near Kalamazoo, <a href="Rockford%2C%20Michigan">Rockford</a>, Big Rapids and Tustin serve southbound traffic while those near <a href="Morley%2C%20Michigan">Morley</a> and Cadillac serve the northbound side of the freeway. The two near Manton and Fife Lake are accessible from both directions. A ninth rest area used to exist near Cutlerville on the northbound side of US 131, but this location was demolished on January 22, 2001, to make way for the interchange with M-6. The department wanted to build a replacement near <a href="Dorr%2C%20Michigan">Dorr</a>, in northern Allegan County, but the plans were canceled in late 2001.

MDOT has also built <a href="carpool">carpool</a> lots for motorists along the freeway. There are 21 lots, all but one adjacent to a freeway interchange. The department touts these lots as a way to save money and benefit the environment, and has partnered with a network of local agencies offering Local Rideshare Offices.

Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. The original <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a> ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey. In the 19th century, the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> chartered private companies to build and operate <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a>s or turnpikes in the state. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. Two thoroughfares in the Grand Rapids area, Division and Plainfield avenues, were originally plank roads. The companies were funded through the collection of tolls. The infrastructure was expensive to maintain, and often the turnpikes fell into disrepair as the wood warped and rotted away. <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> once commented that "the road could not have been bad if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it," after a trip on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road. By the first decade of the 20th century, only 23 of the 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.

The first state-maintained highway along the path of US 131 was <a href="M-13%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-13</a>, a designation applied to the road by July 1, 1919. US 131 debuted along with the rest of the initial U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, although at the time it was shown on maps from the Michigan–Indiana state line north to the small Northern Michigan community of <a href="Acme%2C%20Michigan">Acme</a> in <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20County%2C%20Michigan">Grand Traverse County</a>. The northernmost section of the highway between <a href="Fife%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Fife Lake</a> and Acme was not signposted in the field and the designation ended instead at Fife Lake, about north of the state line. At the same time, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) redesignated the remainder of M-13, between Fife Lake and Petoskey, as <a href="M-131%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-131</a>. Public Act 131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city streets that carried state highways through cities in the state. Until this point, the City of Grand Rapids arbitrarily moved the route of state highways through the city on a regular basis. The department took control of a series of streets and fixed the routing of US 131 through the city after the passage of the act. The highway was shifted between Three Rivers and Constantine to the west side of the St. Joseph River in 1936. In late 1938 or early 1939, the MSHD extended US 131 northward over the southern section of M-131. After the changes US 131 turned eastward into Fife Lake and north to <a href="Kalkaska%2C%20Michigan">Kalkaska</a> and <a href="Mancelona%2C%20Michigan">Mancelona</a> before ending in <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a>. This extension connected US 131 directly to its parent highway, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a>, for the first time. By the end of the 1930s, the MSHD under the leadership of future governor <a href="Murray%20Van%20Wagoner">Murray Van Wagoner</a> had shifted emphasis to a program of road improvements designed to make the state's roads "safer and smoother for burgeoning traffic volumes."

In 1940, a new roadway was opened, completing the third side of a triangle between the junction with <a href="M-113%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-113</a>, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. US 131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other two sides of the triangle became part of M-113 and <a href="M-186%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-186</a>. A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. US 131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between <a href="South%20Boardman%2C%20Michigan">South Boardman</a> and <a href="Orange%20Township%2C%20Kalkaska%20County%2C%20Michigan">Lodi</a>. Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast, from the end of the previous new routing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Bypass%20%28Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">Bypass US 131</a> was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged. A decade later, mainline US 131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former bypass route, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 131</a> (Bus. US 131) was created for the former route through downtown. A second <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop</a> was created in <a href="Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan">Three Rivers, Michigan</a>, after an expressway bypass of the city's downtown was opened in early 1954. Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the <a href="M-32%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-32</a> junction west of <a href="Elmira%2C%20Michigan">Elmira</a> in late 1956.

By the end of 1957, US 131 had been realigned as an expressway from the Three Rivers bypass to <a href="Moorepark%2C%20Michigan">Moorepark</a>. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to <a href="Wayland%2C%20Michigan">Wayland</a> by the middle of 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to <a href="M-118%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-118</a> in <a href="Martin%2C%20Michigan">Martin</a>, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US 131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with <a href="U.S.%20Route%20112">US 112</a> between <a href="White%20Pigeon%2C%20Michigan">White Pigeon</a> and <a href="Mottville%2C%20Michigan">Mottville</a>, US 131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the <a href="M-103%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-103</a> designation was swapped with US 131.

The MSHD had proposed that the section of US 131 south of Kalamazoo be built as an <a href="Intelligent%20transportation%20system">electronic highway</a> under a bid through <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> the same year; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> instead. Another project, through the end of 1961, extended the freeway south to <a href="Plainwell%2C%20Michigan">Plainwell</a> and north into downtown Grand Rapids. This extension was designated as part of Bus. US 131 and opened in December 1961. The opening ceremony for the bridge across the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> included the state highway commission and the then-Miss Michigan, pulled by a team of sled dogs, to lead the first traffic over the river.

Until the early 1960s, US 131 never left the state of Michigan; the southernmost point was always at the Indiana state line. In 1961, the highway designation was extended to its current southern terminus in rural Elkhart County, Indiana at a connection with the Indiana Toll Road at the request of the state of Michigan. The MSHD asked the <a href="Indiana%20State%20Highway%20Department">Indiana State Highway Department</a> (ISHD) to extend US 131 farther to reconnect with US 31 in Indiana near <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>. Michigan State Highway Commissioner <a href="John%20C.%20Mackie">John C. Mackie</a> said that officials with the IHSD were "receptive to the idea" of a further addition to Indianapolis which would provide a "great benefit to Michigan's tourist industry".
On December 17, 1962, the freeway through downtown Grand Rapids was completed, including the section marked as <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a>. The business loop was removed from the freeway when US 131 took its place. East Beltline Avenue was renumbered as an extension of <a href="M-44%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-44</a>, while 28th Street retains the <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a>/<a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a> designations it had in addition to US 131. I-296/US 131 runs alongside the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> between <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> downtown and <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> north of town. At the end of I-296, US 131 followed I-196 east to the northern portion of the business loop at Plainfield Avenue and followed Plainfield Avenue back to the remainder of its routing north of Grand Rapids. The other end of the freeway was extended south to <a href="M-43%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-43</a> on the west side of <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a>. Traffic there is directed along M-43 into downtown to connect with the remainder of the highway.

Freeway construction continued through the 1960s. By the end of 1963, the southern section of freeway was extended to <a href="Schoolcraft%2C%20Michigan">Schoolcraft</a>. The following year, a <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop in Kalamazoo</a> was created. The new loop used a freeway stub on the north and M-43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US 131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown. A discontinuous segment of freeway, south of <a href="Cadillac%2C%20Michigan">Cadillac</a> into <a href="Osceola%20County%2C%20Michigan">Osceola County</a>, opened in September 1966. The freeway was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the <a href="Comstock%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Comstock Park</a> area in 1966. That year, the former Grand Rapids Speedrome, a local race car track was closed. Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive, the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the freeway construction in 1966. The freeway was extended further to <a href="M-57%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-57</a> (14 Mile Road) near <a href="Cedar%20Springs%2C%20Michigan">Cedar Springs</a> in 1969.

In 1968, the section of expressway near Mancelona was downgraded to a two-lane highway. The original roadway had been left in place when a new parallel carriageway was built in 1956. During the winter months, the original lanes built in the 1920s were closed because the grade of the roadway accumulated additional snow and made it difficult to plow. The MSHD had considered reconstructing the older road to retain the expressway setup, but that would have cost $1.5 million while removing it and permanently reconfiguring the 1956 roadway cost only $170,000 (equivalent to $ and $ in ).

The 1970s saw the US 131 freeway expand to north of Grand Rapids. The section between the two M-57 junctions near Rockford and in Cedar Springs opened on September 21, 1973, at a dedication ceremony featuring then-Congressman <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford">Gerald R. Ford</a>. By the end of the year, the freeway would be open as far north as <a href="Howard%20City%2C%20Michigan">Howard City</a>. At the same time, M-46 was realigned to extend south down the freeway to Cedar Springs and west to replace M-57 west of Rockford.

Construction to complete these sections north of Grand Rapids had been delayed in 1967. Before the delays, the MSHD planned to have the gap in the freeway between Grand Rapids and Cadillac completed by 1974. The state even proposed adding the freeway north of Grand Rapids to Petoskey, with a further continuation to <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a> as part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in an effort to receive additional funding in 1968. In September 1972, the US 131 Area Development Association lobbied Congress to "expedite funding and priority for the reconstruction of US 131 in Michigan."
The section of US 131 freeway south of the <a href="Wexford%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wexford</a>–Osceola county line was opened on November 9, 1976, at a cost of $7.4 million (equivalent to $ in ). By 1977, the state postponed any plans to complete the freeway north of Cadillac. The department cited rising construction material costs and opposition to the freeway in Petoskey. By the end of the decade, I-296 signs were removed from the section of freeway in Grand Rapids. However, the freeway remains listed as a part of the Interstate Highway System.

The next section of freeway opened between Howard City and <a href="Stanwood%2C%20Michigan">Stanwood</a> in 1980. Another segment was opened farther north, bypassing <a href="Big%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Big Rapids</a> by 1984. The former route through town and a section of <a href="M-20%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-20</a> were designated as <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Big%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan%29">a business loop</a> simultaneously. US 131 followed 19 Mile Road between the end of the freeway and the former routing north of town. The gap was filled in when the freeway segment between Big Rapids and Osceola County was opened in 1986. The section of highway along 19 Mile Road was transferred to the Big Rapids business loop to connect it back to the new freeway. When the expansions ended, in the mid-1980s, it was expected that the US 131 freeway would end at the south side of Cadillac, "perhaps forever". MDOT had ended all consideration of additional freeway mileage in 1981, citing decreased gas tax revenues, decreased traffic and higher construction costs. A 1979 report said that while traffic forecasts showed continued growth, upgrades to existing roads would be sufficient to handle traffic needs.

One of the more unusual sections of the US 131 freeway in the Grand Rapids area is the S-Curve. This section of freeway carries US 131 over the Grand River with two sharp turns in the road, resembling the letter S. The design for this structure was completed in 1952 and placed the freeway on the least expensive land in the area, despite the knowledge that it would someday create issues. As noted by "<a href="The%20Grand%20Rapids%20Press">The Grand Rapids Press</a>" in 1981, "the speed limit on the S-Curve must be reduced as low as 25 mph [] on some bad-weather days because of the sharpness of the turns and [the] numerous accidents [that] have occurred there."

On December 27, 1999, the state awarded a $85.7 million contract (equivalent to $ in ) for the replacement of the S-Curve on US 131. Deposits of <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000 vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a de-icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6 km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the at which salt stops working. Unlike salt, the non-corrosive de-icer does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the <a href="Road%20surface">pavement</a> wet and prevent the formation of ice.

Construction delays were caused by river flooding during spring rains. A design mistake meant that one of the bridges in the structure was built a foot () too low, and Grandville Avenue was lowered to compensate for the error. Before the opening, MDOT held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on the freeway to allow local residents to walk along the structure on August 12. The first northbound lanes were opened to traffic in mid-August, three weeks ahead of schedule. Lead contractor Kiewit Western, a company whose "employees have been known to work 13-hour days and 100-hour weeks", accelerated their work schedule over the course of the project to compensate for the delays and still finish the venture early. The remaining lanes opened to traffic on October 26, also ahead of schedule. Additional work started after the main roadway opened by closing various ramps for reconstruction. This work also focused on restoring parking lots located under or adjacent to the freeway and testing the de-icing system; the final ramps were opened in early December 2000 and early January 2001. The end result of the construction produced a freeway design that increased the rated traffic speed from .

MDOT approved a $3.5 billion 10-year transportation plan (equivalent to $ in ) in 1986 that included an extension of the US 131 freeway north to <a href="Manton%2C%20Michigan">Manton</a>. Construction started on the Cadillac bypass in 1999, and the first section was opened to traffic in November 2000. This southern segment ran from US 131 south of town to <a href="M-55%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-55</a> east of downtown. US 131 remained routed through downtown, but M-55 was rerouted to the bypass. Local residents were allowed to use the northern section of the bypass for recreational activities until it was opened to traffic. The full bypass around Cadillac was dedicated to Sidney Ouwinga in a ceremony on October 27, 2001, and the road was opened to traffic on October 30, 2001. The former routing through town was redesignated <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Cadillac%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 131</a> at the same time. Ouwinga was a state lawmaker who died in 1991 while serving in the <a href="Michigan%20House%20of%20Representatives">Michigan House of Representatives</a>. He was also a member of the US 131 Area Development Association which promoted further northern extensions of the freeway. The freeway expansion north around the city of <a href="Manton%2C%20Michigan">Manton</a> was opened in 2003. The former routing was redesignated as a <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131%20Business%20%28Manton%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop</a> at the time. The two bypasses cost $146 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete.

Design plans for the new bridge over the St. Joseph River were announced in January 2011. The expected groundbreaking on the venture was scheduled for February 4, 2013, with planned completion in 2014. Residents in the community were divided over the proposed highway. Business owners look to the 3,000 cars and trucks that pass through downtown Constantine each day for customers, traffic that would be diverted around the village by the new roadway. On the other hand, residents that work outside of the small community were looking forward to decreased commute times to their workplaces. The bypass opened on October 30, 2013.

Originally, MDOT and its predecessor agencies had planned to convert US 131 into a freeway all the way to Petoskey. They suggested adding the highway to the Interstate Highway System in the late 1960s, when the federal government took proposals for additions to the network of highways. While further northward extension of the freeway from Manton to Kalkaska and beyond was postponed by the department in the 1970s, and canceled "perhaps forever" in the early 1980s, MDOT made an attempt to revive the extension to Kalkaska in 2000. The proposal was ultimately abandoned when the year's transportation plan was finalized. A bridge replacement project over the Manistee River in 2009–10 ensured the end of further consideration by MDOT of the proposal. According to the local project director, "currently, the department has no plans [to expand the freeway]. Someday it may happen, but not in the foreseeable future."

A southerly extension of the freeway to or near the Indiana state line is still under study. Improvements to the US 131 corridor from Portage to the Indiana Toll Road have been underway for several years and although a late-2005 decision by MDOT to not pursue a new controlled-access route through <a href="St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph County</a> seemed to terminate the discussion, public outcry and backlash from local legislators forced the department to re-evaluate its decision. State House Speaker <a href="Craig%20DeRoche">Craig DeRoche</a> was critical of the original decision, citing the economic development benefit such a road would bring to the area in defense of the proposed freeway. The previous "no-build decision" was rescinded in April 2006.

MDOT has begun a project to upgrade a segment of US 131 in St. Joseph County, home of one of the most dangerous roadway sections in Southwest Michigan for auto crashes.<ref name="killian/parker"></ref> The final <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> for the project was published in mid-2008 and the preferred alternative consists of a two-lane road bypassing the village of <a href="Constantine%2C%20Michigan">Constantine</a>. The new highway would maintain access to local roads via at-grade intersections, and the department would maintain jurisdiction of the old route through town. MDOT has stated that present traffic demands do not warrant the cost of a full freeway facility on a new alignment from the Indiana Toll Road to north of Three Rivers, stating that such a project would cost over $300 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build. Construction plans were placed on hold after an announcement in June 2009 as various proposals around the state, including the Constantine bypass, were shelved until funding issues could be resolved. In total, 137 road and bridge projects totaling $740 million were delayed to 2012 because the state could not match available federal funding to pay for the work.

US 131 and its predecessors bears several memorial designations in addition to the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the <a href="Mackinaw%20Trail">Mackinaw Trail</a>, named after a former <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trail that ran from <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a> to Mackinaw City and <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US 131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Senate">State Senate</a> did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> revitalized the idea.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, households would display a <a href="service%20flag">service flag</a> if a family member was serving in the war. A blue star denoted a service member in action, and a gold star symbolized someone who died in the military. In St. Joseph County, the chapters of the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> and the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> wanted to honor the local fallen soldiers. Using the flags as inspiration, they planted 100 <a href="Juglans%20nigra">black walnut</a> and four <a href="Picea%20abies">Norway spruce</a> trees along the road south of Three Rivers. Dedicated on May 4, 1924, this tribute was named the Gold Star Memorial Highway and ran for along what is now US 131 south of Three Rivers.

In 1921, the section of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This designation included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all named in honor of Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the <a href="Barry%20County%2C%20Michigan">Barry County</a> prosecutor and a <a href="Michigan%20Senate">state senator</a> in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.

In the age of the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>s, it was common for highways to be named rather than numbered. An attempt to create a trail such as the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a> failed in Michigan. School children in 1926 from <a href="Anderson%2C%20Indiana">Anderson, Indiana</a>, wanted to honor <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a>, the poet from the Hoosier State, with a highway that connected the country's summer and winter resort areas. The Michigan segment of the road running through the state was to follow what would later be US 131. The James Whitcomb Riley Association promoted the highway by painting white bands on telephone poles with the name of the road in orange letters during that August and September. However, the road in question was already named the Mackinaw Trail, and the association did not secure permission of the state highway commissioner, as was required by a 1919 Michigan law. The law made it illegal for any "association to delineate or mark any other routes or trails through the State of Michigan... unless the same shall be approved in writing by the State Highway Commissioner." As a result, government officials refused to endorse the association's proposal, and Michigan was excluded from the highway. The efforts of the national association were stunted by the halted progress, and the highway was disbanded by December 1926.

The Michigan Trail, another auto trail from the 1920s, "followed just about every major trunk line at that time in the Lower Peninsula and covered over a thousand miles [] of state highways." The Michigan Trail started in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a>, and ran to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>; its branches extended to <a href="New%20Buffalo%2C%20Michigan">New Buffalo</a>, Grand Rapids, and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>. Other segments included US 131 between Kalamazoo and Petoskey, US 31 between New Buffalo and the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a> and a route between Port Huron and Big Rapids. The highway failed as a concept because it lacked focus, and many of the segments of roadway had already assigned names.

The most recent name applied to US 131 is related to the first. Enacted in 2004, Public Act 138 added an additional name to the Mackinaw Trail from the M-66 junction near Kalkaska to Petoskey, the "Green Arrow Route-Mackinaw Trail". Residents of the state have questioned the wisdom of having a "compound road name whose signboards [would] be nearly as long as the highway itself."

MDOT maintains a listing of historic bridges that includes two which formerly carried US 131. In 1913, the State Trunk Line Act required the highway department to build and maintain bridges at the state's expense if they were included in the nascent highway system. Among the first of these state-built structures is the <a href="Division%20Avenue%E2%80%93Plaster%20Creek%20Bridge">Division Avenue–Plaster Creek Bridge</a> in Grand Rapids. The crossing is listed on the NRHP for its architectural and engineering significance. Built as Trunk Line Bridge No. 3 over <a href="Plaster%20Creek">Plaster Creek</a> in 1914 by the MSHD, the span cost just over $6,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Division Avenue carried US 131 until the construction of the freeway through Grand Rapids in the 1960s. The bridge, a filled spandrel arch design, is , and was modified in 1935 to widen its deck from to the current . The structure was added to the NRHP on December 17, 1999.

The second bridge listed by MDOT is the crossing of the Little Muskegon River for 190th Avenue in southern Mecosta County. Like the Plaster Creek bridge, this structure was also built by the MSHD under the Trunk Line Act of 1913. Built in 1916–17 the , , concrete through-girder bridge cost around $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to build. It was initially named Trunk Line Bridge No. 61. The span is the oldest concrete girder bridge designed by the MSHD. US 131 followed 190th Avenue over the river until a realignment shifted the highway to another route in 1927.

Romances (Luis Miguel album)

Romances is the twelfth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Mexican singer <a href="Luis%20Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>, released on 12 August 1997, by <a href="Warner%20Music%20Latina">WEA Latina</a>. It is the third album of the "Romance" series, in which Miguel covers Latin songs from 1940 to 1978. Aside from Miguel, the production also involved <a href="music%20arranger">arranger</a> <a href="Bebu%20Silvetti">Bebu Silvetti</a>, and <a href="Armando%20Manzanero">Armando Manzanero</a>, who directed all of Miguel's "Romance" albums. "Romances" consists of twelve <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s and two new compositions by Manzanero and Silvetti. Recording took place in early 1997 at the Ocean Way recording studio in Los Angeles, California.

"Romances" has sold over 4.5 million copies and received platinum certifications in several Latin American countries, the United States and Spain. Miguel promoted the album by touring the United States, Latin America and Spain. Upon its release, "Romances" received generally positive reviews from music critics. They mainly praised his vocals and production of the album although few reviewers found the arrangements to be repetitive and the record too similar to its predecessors. The album earned Miguel several awards, including the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance</a> in the United States. Six singles were released: "<a href="Por%20Debajo%20de%20la%20Mesa">Por Debajo de la Mesa</a>", "El Reloj", "Contigo (Estar Contigo)", "De Quererte Así (De T'Avoir Aimee)", "<a href="B%C3%A9same%20Mucho">Bésame Mucho</a>", and "Sabor a Mí".

In 1991 Miguel released "<a href="Romance%20%28Luis%20Miguel%20album%29">Romance</a>", a collection of classic Latin ballads, the oldest of which dates back to the 1940s. The album was <a href="record%20producer">produced</a> by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, and was credited for revitalizing the <a href="bolero">bolero</a> genre. It also made history as the first Spanish-language album to be certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in the United States. A follow-up to "Romance" was released in 1994 under the title "<a href="Segundo%20Romance">Segundo Romance</a>" ("Second Romance"), which was produced by Miguel, Juan Carlos Calderón and Kiko Cibrian. Both albums received a platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States and also became successful in countries outside of Latin America and the United States, such as <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, selling over twelve million copies combined.

In December 1996 Miguel held a press conference in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, where he announced his desire to record a third "Romance" album and mentioned the possibility of working with Manzanero and <a href="Juan%20Gabriel">Juan Gabriel</a>. He also expressed an interest in singing in Italian and Portuguese, although the album's songs are originally all in Spanish. Two months later Manzanero confirmed that he was working with Miguel on another bolero-inspired ballads album, under the tentative title "Tercer Romance" ("Third Romance"). Miguel's record label confirmed that fourteen tracks would be included on the album under the title "Romances".

Miguel collaborated with Silvetti for the arrangement of "Romances", while Manzanero was in charge of direction. Recording began on 18 March 1997, at <a href="Ocean%20Way%20Recording">Ocean Way Recording</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> and at <a href="The%20Hit%20Factory">The Hit Factory</a> in New York City. During the recording of "Romances", as in "Romance", Silvetti employed his signature style of arrangements known as the "Silvetti Sound", which <a href="Leila%20Cobo">Leila Cobo</a> of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" describes as "anchored in sweeping melodies, lush string arrangements, acoustic instrumentation, and above all, unabashed <a href="romanticism">romanticism</a>". Silvetti has stated that when he produces an album he does not simply copy his own arrangements, because he feels that would be "ridiculous", and prefers to be creative within his own style. About the selection of songs for the album, Manzanero stated that "I give [Miguel] the songs, and he chooses what he wants to record." Participants in the recording sessions included sixty-one musicians from the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a>.

Miguel covers twelve ballads in "Romances", including songs by José Antonio Méndez, Carlos Arturo Briz, <a href="Consuelo%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Consuelo Velázquez</a> <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Carrillo">Álvaro Carrillo</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Cantoral">Roberto Cantoral</a>, <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Grever">María Grever</a>, <a href="Enrique%20Santos%20Disc%C3%A9polo">Enrique Santos Discépolo</a>, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Lara">Agustín Lara</a>. He also covers songs from other musical styles including <a href="tango">tango</a> ("Uno"), <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a> ("<a href="Manh%C3%A3%20de%20Carnaval">Mañana de Carnaval</a>"), and French ("De Quererte Así"). Miguel had performed some of the aforementioned composers' songs on his previous "Romance" albums. Miguel recorded Manazero's songs "Voy a Apagar la Luz/Contigo Aprendí" ("I Am Going To Turn Off The Lights/With You I Learned") and "Amanecer" ("To Be Awake"). The two original compositions were "Por Debajo de la Mesa" ("Underneath the Table") by Manzanero and "Contigo (Estar Contigo)" ("To Be With You") by Bebu Silvetti and Sylvia Riera Ibáñez.

Miguel launched his <a href="Romances%20Tour">Romances Tour</a>, consisting of 80 concerts, in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 12 September 1997. The performances featured Miguel performing dance-pop and bolero arrangements for two-and-a-half hours. Adam Sandler of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" expressed a mixed reaction to the concert in the <a href="Universal%20Amphitheatre">Universal Amphitheatre</a> in Los Angeles. He noted that Miguel rarely acknowledged his audience or ventured out from center stage. Robert Hilburn of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" had a more positive reaction, which he described as a "marvelously designed and wonderfully executed blend of Latin music tradition". Another Times contributor, Ernesto Lechner, wrote that Miguel's bolero performance at the <a href="Arrowhead%20Pond">Arrowhead Pond</a> arena in California "brought the house down" and stated that the experience at the concert was "pretty close" to <a href="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a>. In New York City, Miguel performed five consecutive shows in the <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>. In <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> he performed seventeen consecutive concerts in the <a href="National%20Auditorium">National Auditorium</a>, where it was the highest-grossing concert by a Latin artist that year. The tour also traveled to South America; including <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and Argentina; and continued until May 1998, when Miguel performed throughout Spain. Miguel was the first Latin artist to be inducted to the "Pollstar" "Top 20 All-Time Grossing Tours" for most tickets sold for consecutive concerts at one venue in 1997.

"Por Debajo de la Mesa" was released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from the album. The single was released for <a href="radio%20airplay">radio airplay</a> on 15 July 1997, and reached number one on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">"Billboard" Hot Latin Songs</a> chart two months later; it would spend twenty-six weeks on the chart. The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for the song was filmed at the <a href="Rainbow%20Room">Rainbow Room</a> in New York City and was directed by Daniela Federici. The second single released, "El Reloj" ("The Clock"), reached number two on the Hot Latin Songs chart, as did the third single, "Contigo (Estar Contigo"). "De Quererte Así (De T'Avoir Aimee)" peaked at number twenty-three on the Hot Latin Songs chart, while "Sabor a Mí" ("Taste From Me") peaked at number six after its release. "Bésame Mucho" ("Kiss Me More") reached number one on the Mexican singles chart and was the among top ten best-performing songs of 1998 in Venezuela according to "<a href="Record%20Report">Record Report</a>".

Upon its release, "Romances" was met with mostly positive reviews by music critics. Terry Jenkins of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> praised the collaborative work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called "Romances" "a sensuous, enchanting album". <a href="Achy%20Obejas">Achy Obejas</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" called Miguel's voice the album's strong point and noted the "presence of electronic instruments and the darker, more somber mood". On the other hand, she felt that Miguel was beginning "to slip", citing the tracks "Jurame" and "Por Debajo de la Mesa" as examples. Fernando Gonzalez wrote for the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>" noting although the album is "Impeccably produced, arranged and recorded", he felt that boleros "demand more than that". Gonzalez elaborated: " He sounds simply loud, rather than romantic, in "Sabor a Mi; he comes across as (soap) operatic rather than tormented in "El Reloj "; he is a star -- not a humble student -- in "Contigo Aprendi"." The "<a href="Corpus%20Christi%20Caller-Times">Corpus Christi Caller-Times</a>" music critic Rene Carbrera wrote a positive review of the album praising the string arrangements as "elegantly done" and complimented Miguel's take on "Sabor a Mí" and "La Gloria Eres Tu" as he had done it "delightfully done in the traditional way and flavored with <a href="Trio%20Los%20Panchos">Trio Los Panchos</a> requinto "cling" endings." Mario Tarradell of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" wrote an unfavorable review of the recording; he criticized its productions for having all the tracks "awash in silky keyboards and airy strings with just a hint of percussion in the background". He also panned its lead single "Por Debajo de la Mesa" for coming off as a "love song for the chaste" due to its arrangements being "so stifling, so precious, it's difficult to feel any sensuality". 

"Los Angeles Times" editor Ernesto Lecnher gave the album one-and-a-half out of four stars and claimed that "Romances" "sinks under its own weight, delivering mostly bloated versions of timeless material". Fellow "Los Angeles Times" contributor Ed Morales disagreed with his review: "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, snuggle up with his significant other and really listen to 'Romances.' I give his review * and 'Romances' ****" . Anne Valdespino of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Daily%20News">Los Angeles Daily News</a>" praised the selection of songs and Miguel's performance, calling the performer a "class act". "<a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" music critic Ernesto Portillo Jr. rated "Romances" three-out-of four stars and claimed that Miguel's "interpretations are first-rate and the music, with production help from famed composer Armando Manzanero, is executed with exquisite precision". However, he questioned the need for a third in the "Romance" series as he felt it "diminishes the specialness" of "Romance" and "Segundo Romance" noted that not all tracks in the album are "true boleros". "<a href="El%20Nuevo%20Herald">El Nuevo Herald</a>" editor Eliseo Cardona wrote a mostly positive review of the album. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the productions but stated that Migule's interpretation of "La Gloria Eres Tu" "pales" compared to <a href="Lucho%20Gatica">Lucho Gatica</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Jos%C3%A9">José José</a>'s cover of the song. Ramiro Burr of the "<a href="San%20Antonio%20Express-News">San Antonio Express-News</a>" said "Romances" "sparkles with the joy of visiting good friends" and lauded its "timeless music, beautiful orchestration" and complimented Silvetti's arrangements. Burr commented while "we've heard all these classics before, and seemingly a million times" Miguel "does it so well, it hardly seems to matter."

At the <a href="40th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">40th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 1998, Miguel won the award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Pop%20Album">Best Latin Pop Performance</a>. Miguel also received the <a href="Billboard%20Latin%20Music%20Awards">Billboard Latin Music Award</a> for "Male Pop Album of the Year" and the <a href="World%20Music%20Awards">World Music Award</a> for "Best Selling Latin Artist" in the same year.

The album was released on 12 August 1997, in the United States and, by the week of 23 August 1997, it debuted at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20Top%20Latin%20Albums">"Billboard" Top Latin Albums</a> chart. A week later it became number one, which it has been for a total of eleven non-consecutive weeks. "Romances" was even more successful in the <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Albums">"Billboard" Latin Pop Albums</a> chart, having been number one for 13 weeks. On the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart it peaked at number fourteen, with sales of over 57,000 units within the first week—a record at that time for a Spanish-language album. It was also Miguel's highest-peaking album in the "Billboard" 200 until the release of "<a href="C%C3%B3mplices">Cómplices</a>" in 2008, which peaked at number ten. It was the second best-selling Latin album in the United States during 1997, after "<a href="Tango%20%28Julio%20Iglesias%20album%29">Tango</a>" by <a href="Julio%20Iglesias">Julio Iglesias</a>. , it has sold 687,000 copies in the US, making it the 19th bestselling Latin album in the country.

Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars

Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (also known as Circle of Blood in the United States) is a 1996 <a href="Point-and-click%20adventure">point-and-click adventure game</a> developed by <a href="Revolution%20Software">Revolution Software</a>. It is the first game in the "<a href="Broken%20Sword">Broken Sword</a>" series. The player assumes the role of <a href="George%20Stobbart%20%28Broken%20Sword%29">George Stobbart</a>, an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy. The game takes place in both real and fictional locations in Europe and the Middle East.

In 1992, <a href="Charles%20Cecil">Charles Cecil</a> began researching the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a> for the game after he, Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan conceived "Broken Sword". It was built with Revolution's <a href="Virtual%20Theatre">Virtual Theatre</a> engine. This was also used for the company's previous two games. Cecil co-wrote and directed the game, while Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. The game has a serious tone, but features humor and graphics in the style of classic animated films.

Critics lauded "Broken Sword"s story, puzzles, <a href="voice%20acting">voice acting</a>, writing, gameplay, and music. The game received numerous award nominations and wins. It achieved commercial success as well, with one million copies sold by 2001. Topping several lists, it is known as one of the greatest examples of adventure gaming. Many developers of later games have cited "Broken Sword" as an influence.

After its initial release on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="Mac%20OS">Mac OS</a>, and <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>, it was ported to the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="Palm%20OS">Palm OS</a>, and <a href="Windows%20Mobile">Windows Mobile</a>. The game spawned a number of sequels collectively known as the "Broken Sword" series. From 2009 to 2012, a was released on <a href="Wii">Wii</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, Microsoft Windows, <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a>, <a href="iOS">iOS</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>.

"Broken Sword" is a 2D <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> played from a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person perspective</a>. The player uses a <a href="Point%20and%20click">point-and-click</a> interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist <a href="George%20Stobbart%20%28Broken%20Sword%29">George Stobbart</a> through the game's world. To solve <a href="puzzle">puzzle</a>s and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via <a href="Dialog%20tree">dialogue tree</a>s presented through "conversation icons" to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. The player navigates with a map, to which new locations are added as the story unfolds. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, <a href="Game%20over">the protagonist's death</a> is possible, after which the player starts from the last <a href="save%20point">save point</a>.

As the game begins, American tourist George Stobbart witnesses a terrorist attack at a café in Paris, during which a clown steals an old man's briefcase and detonates a bomb. Soon after, George meets Nicole Collard, a journalist who is photographing the scene. George investigates the area to help Nicole gather information about the attack. He finds the clown's discarded nose, a tissue covered in theatrical greasepaint, and a piece of fabric from the clown's jacket in the sewers around the cafe and learns that a man was seen escaping with a briefcase. After Nicole discovers the address of a costume shop inside the clown nose, George learns from that shop's owner that the nose and theatrical greasepaint had been purchased by a man named Khan.

George travels to the hotel where Khan is staying, where he obtains an ancient <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> from Khan's hotel safe. After evading two hired thugs, Flap and Guido, George takes the manuscript to Nicole, who deduces that it is related to the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>. In a nearby museum, George finds a tripod that is illustrated in the manuscript. He soon travels to the excavation site in Lochmarne, Ireland where the tripod had been discovered; and, there, he obtains a gem identical to one on the manuscript. After facing a <a href="The%20Goat%20Puzzle">goat</a>, George finds an entrance to a Templar chapel beneath the local castle ruins, where he discovers a mural of a hanged man with "Montfauçon" written underneath.

George returns to Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a colleague of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who claim to be the Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, <a href="Baphomet">Baphomet</a>; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.

Back in Paris, George learns from Andre that the manuscript mentions the Spanish De Vasconcellos family, who were once connected with the Templars. At the family's villa, George speaks to the family's sole surviving member, a <a href="Count">Count</a>ess, who leads him to the De Vasconcellos <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a>. There, George discovers the family's chalice, which the Countess entrusts to George. She asks him to find her missing ancestor, Don Carlos. In Paris, George uses the lens in the church at Montfauçon and discovers a hidden image of a burning man. In the church, George find Don Carlos' tomb, which is inscribed with a series of <a href="Bible">biblical</a> references.

Andre reveals that an idol of Baphomet has been discovered in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers an image of a church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole, and Andre decide that the Templars are going to <a href="Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a>, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed during the confrontation. George and Nicole reach the church in time to see the Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives Khan had given Nicole before his death. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars, and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nicole's first kiss.

In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan, then-head of publishing at <a href="Virgin%20Interactive">Virgin Interactive</a>, and spoke about how the Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine "Génération 4", <a href="Charles%20Cecil">Charles Cecil</a> stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's "<a href="Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress">Lure of the Temptress</a>" and 1994's then-upcoming "<a href="Beneath%20a%20Steel%20Sky">Beneath a Steel Sky</a>". The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading "<a href="The%20Holy%20Blood%20and%20the%20Holy%20Grail">The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</a>", he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior <a href="BBC">BBC</a> scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist <a href="Steve%20Ince">Steve Ince</a> created initial location sketches for the game before working on "Beneath a Steel Sky". He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.

Despite releasing the PC version, Virgin was not interested in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, "Broken Sword" was renamed to "Circle of Blood". Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, <a href="THQ">THQ</a> published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original "Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars" title.

One of Cecil's goals was to depart from the humorous adventure games more popular at the time, such as <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>' <a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">"Monkey Island" series</a>, by creating a game with good pacing and a complex storyline, a reason he thought the Knights Templar would be an ideal subject. Unlike LucasArts games, which used a question-and-answer conversation system, "Broken Sword" offered "conversation icons" that would not reveal to the player what the protagonist was about to say; Cecil's intention was to make the game more cinematic, but not resemble <a href="interactive%20movie">interactive movie</a>s of that time; he felt that they were "mimicking movies." He wanted to create two protagonists who would exchange ideas, helping drive the game along. He made George American and Nico French to appeal to US and European markets.

The team at Revolution had high expectations for "Broken Sword", but there was significant competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's <a href="Don%20Bluth">Don Bluth studios</a> drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, who worked for the <a href="House%20of%20Cool">Red Rover animation studio</a>. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.

Cecil contacted composer <a href="Barrington%20Pheloung">Barrington Pheloung</a>, who agreed to create the game's score. Around the time of the game's release, Pheloung stated, "Virgin would probably have been happy with a main theme and a few cues, but I thought that rather than creating an orchestral score like for a movie, I could make one which interacted with the game. So I've written over three hours of music, which is unique in the genre, and over 400 cues." He scored the music for orchestra and added the structural elements by breaking it up into sampled pieces.

Revolution had already cast Hazel Ellerby as Nicole Collard, but had trouble finding a voice actor for George Stobbart. Hazel, who went to the <a href="Guildhall%20School%20of%20Music%20and%20Drama">Guildhall School of Music and Drama</a> in London, suggested her former schoolmate from Guildhall, <a href="Rolf%20Saxon">Rolf Saxon</a>, as George. Charles offered him the job, and Saxon accepted. The remaining credited voice actors in the original are Rachel Atkins, David Bannerman, Rosy Clayton, <a href="Jack%20Elliott%20%28broadcaster%29">Jack Elliott</a>, <a href="Steve%20Hodson">Steve Hodson</a>, David Holt, <a href="Peter%20Kenny">Peter Kenny</a>, Richard Mapletoft, <a href="Matthew%20Marsh%20%28actor%29">Matthew Marsh</a>, <a href="Colin%20McFarlane">Colin McFarlane</a>, Don McCorkindale, <a href="Gavin%20Muir%20%28British%20actor%29">Gavin Muir</a>, Paul Panting, and Andrew Wincott.

Cecil was the game's director and writer, <a href="Tony%20Warriner">Tony Warriner</a> and David Sykes the designer-programmers, and Noirin Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the <a href="Virtual%20Theatre">Virtual Theatre</a> engine, as do "Lure of the Temptress" and "Beneath a Steel Sky". The game's final cost was one million <a href="Pound%20%28currency%29">pounds</a>. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002, and to the <a href="Palm%20OS">Palm OS</a> and <a href="Windows%20Mobile">Windows Mobile</a> in 2006.

In March 2009, <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> released a <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> of "The Shadow of the Templars" entitled "" for the Wii and Nintendo DS. <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a>, with whom Revolution worked on "Beneath a Steel Sky", created additional artwork for the game. Due to the platform's size limits, the DS version contains no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the "Director's Cut" for <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> was released on January 20, 2010. In May 2010, a version in high definition was released for the <a href="iPad">iPad</a>. Versions for Windows and <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> were released in September 2, 2010, on digital-distribution services. An Android version was released on <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a> in June 2012. The original version of the game is only available from Sold-Out Software and <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> with "Director's Cut" purchases.

"Broken Sword" was a commercial success. By August 2000, it had achieved sales of 825,000 copies, of which 480,000 were sold at full price. As of April 2001, combined sales of its computer and PlayStation releases had surpassed one million units, according to Revolution Software. Charles Cecil later noted that the PlayStation release alone accounted for 500,000 sales. "Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director's Cut" also sold well—particularly the iOS version, which, along with "The Smoking Mirror"s remastered edition, was downloaded by over four million people in 2011. According to Cecil, the <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a>'s sales were higher than those of "" and "".

"Broken Sword" was acclaimed by critics, who praised the game's story, art direction, musical score, voice acting, and writing. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" stated that "Broken Sword" was superior to LucasArts' adventure games, such as "Monkey Island" and "<a href="The%20Dig">The Dig</a>", and believed it to be an "adventure gaming milestone" and the "best graphic adventure to date."

<a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a>' Angella Mooney commented that the game's "deep and mysterious plot is designed to be thought-provoking and highly entertaining at the same time." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Rebecca B. Anderson found that the game's combination of real history and "highly-creative" storytelling "add[s] spice to an already-entertaining adventure." Joe Antol of <a href="Adventure%20Classic%20Gaming">Adventure Classic Gaming</a> wrote that the involvement of the Knights Templar generated a "unique experience of creative storytelling." A writer for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" magazine stated that the story is "rich in mystery and intrigue, with plenty of puzzles and locations to explore." "Edge"s reviewer praised the game's use of "legend and modern-day intrigue", and believed that "Revolution Software finally escaped the shadow of "Monkey Island" "et al." and [have] taken the graphic adventure to new levels in terms of both story and spectacle." The writer commented that, by weaving its "trans-European plot around the legends of the Knights Templar", the game "succeeds in appearing weighty and complex without ever losing its sense of place".

Mark Wolf of "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>" called the game "visually stunning", praising the animated graphics as "crisp and clear" and the artwork as "simply beautiful". He also wrote, "At the highest setting, the background and foreground scroll separately, delivering a sense of depth you don't see in many graphic adventures. Even the atmosphere of each of the areas you explore fit the locale." Mooney called the animation "extremely colorful and well-executed" and noted that the art team "have taken this style of animation and really made an elegant, mature game with it." The writer also noted that the environments are "detailed and inviting". Anderson called the game a "visual treat" and a "work of art," noting that "every scene is filled with rich, lush, illustrative detail that rivals any animated feature film." "Next Generation"s writer called the character movements "fantastic" and the <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s "a joy to watch." The writer for "Edge" praised its art direction, in which "every visual element is polished to the 'nth' degree". The reviewer believed that "the <a href="Super%20video%20graphics%20array">SVGA</a> artwork by far exceeds the competition in this genre."

"Edge" complimented its musical score for "play[ing] a large part in mood enhancement", noting that "it's beautifully orchestrated and adds immeasurable atmosphere." Mooney also praised the score, calling it "ambitious and beautiful" and saying it adds a very "cinematic feel" to the experience. Mooney said that the game's voice acting is "of supreme quality" with "delightful dialogue", but noted that long conversations might "turn some players off". Wolf was more critical of the voice acting, calling it "not too professional" and "the worst thing in the game".

"<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "despite the ambitious storyline and animation [...] we might have felt grateful for a month's delay, given the poor quality of the port."

Mooney stated that the game's puzzles are well integrated into the plot and are moderately challenging. Wolf called the puzzles inventive and challenging, but believed that some require "too much pixel-hunting". "Next Generation"s writer said that almost all of the puzzles are simplistic, requiring no more than to find an object and use it on something else. Despite acclaiming the Windows version, GameSpot deemed the PlayStation version mediocre, criticizing technical deficiencies, such as lengthy load times and muddy graphics. Cecil later cited the PlayStation version as his "one big regret" regarding the game. He believed that the team should have introduced direct control over the player character in this version, instead of mouse-driven point-and-click interaction.

"Génération 4" awarded it "Best Adventure 1997", and it received the award for "Best Quest" from the magazine "Quest". The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> magazine program "<a href="Live%20%26amp%3B%20Kicking">Live & Kicking</a>" awarded it "Best PC Game of 1996".

Adventure Gamers ranked "Broken Sword" fourth on its lists of "Top 20 Adventure Games of All-Time" in 2004 and "Top 100 All-Time Adventures" in 2011. In 2006, Adventure Classic Gaming put the game in third place on its list of the "Top 10 retro graphic adventure games of all time from PC to consoles". It was listed on <a href="Bright%20Hub">Bright Hub</a>'s "Best Windows Mobile Games Software" in 2008. In 2010, "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" placed it in second on its list of the "Top 20 Adventure Games of All-Time ... not by LucasArts", and was included in Universe Publishing's "<a href="1001%20Video%20Games%20You%20Must%20Play%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a>", a book by video game designer and programmer <a href="Peter%20Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a> and longtime "Edge" editor Tony Mott published in 2010. NowGamer listed it on its 2011 feature, "Greatest Point-And-Click Games (Not By LucasArts)". In 2012, it ranked eighth on <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s "Best point-and-click adventure games". "Broken Sword" and its remake are listed on Adventure Gamers' "Top Adventure Games" recommendations list. It is currently the third best-reviewed adventure game on GameSpot.

In 2012, it was listed on <a href="GameFront">GameFront</a>'s "5 Crazy Difficult and Intricate Video Game Puzzles". "Computer and Video Games" also ranked Barrington's original intro theme 21st on its 2012 "Video game soundtracks: The 100 best themes of all time" list. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" listed Khan as one of "The 10 best video game assassins", while in 2013, <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> listed him as one of "The Scariest Clowns And Jesters In Video Games". The "Director's Cut" has been placed on top lists as well, particularly the iOS versions.

In his book "Game Plan: Great Designs that Changed the Face of Computer Gaming", British <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game journalist</a> <a href="Ste%20Curran">Ste Curran</a> wrote that "Broken Sword" influenced the adventure games "<a href="Toonstruck">Toonstruck</a>", in which Cecil has a "Special Thanks" credit, and "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>", which features a puzzle that involves a broken sword. Kevin Bruner, co-founder of <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a>, has said that he is a "Broken Sword" fan. Ashton Raze, a writer for <a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a> and the co-creator of the 2013 adventure game "<a href="Richard%20%26amp%3B%20Alice">Richard & Alice</a>", said that "Broken Sword" is his biggest influence. In his review of the 2010 adventure game "Deponia", Declan Skews of Video Games Interactive said that the game drew inspiration from "Broken Sword".

Cecil has said that the game's fanbase believes <a href="Dan%20Brown">Dan Brown</a> to have been influenced by "Broken Sword" when writing his novel, "<a href="The%20Da%20Vinci%20Code">The Da Vinci Code</a>", because of the parallels between the two works. Cecil stated that he is flattered by this sentiment, but that he would never claim so himself due to the threat of Brown's "very serious" lawyers. Joao Diniz Sanches of "Pocket Gamer" said "Broken Sword" story is a "tale, some would argue, that effortlessly outclasses Dan Brown's similarly themed and tricksy novel." In an article about "Broken Sword", "Computer and Video Games" described the Knights Templar legend as a "great mythology to base a game on", and noted that "Broken Sword" "came out years before the "Da Vinci Code" made that sort of thing popular."

"Broken Sword" spawned four sequels. The first, "", was released in 1997. It uses the same <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> as the first "Broken Sword" game. Six years later, Revolution released "Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon", which features <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a> and a direct-control mechanism. It uses the <a href="RenderWare">RenderWare</a> engine. In 2006 the company released "Broken Sword: The Angel of Death" ("Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game" in North America), which returns to the point-and-click system used in the first two games. It is the only game in the series not released for a console, and it uses <a href="Sumo%20Digital">Sumo Digital</a>'s engine. The fifth installment, "", was announced through a <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> project in August 2012. The game features 2D graphics, and it was released in September 2013.

After releasing the "Director's Cut" version of "Broken Sword", Revolution released a <a href="remaster">remaster</a>ed edition of the second game, entitled "Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered", in 2010.

In May 2007, <a href="ComingSoon.net">ComingSoon.net</a> reported that Cecil, encouraged by the success of "The Angel of Death", had begun work on a "Broken Sword" theatrical film adaptation. According to the website, producers Jay Douglas and Nav Guptatheir and their CastleBright Studios production company were involved. Justin Kaplan introduced Cecil to the company and was set to be one of the producers. Conversations had begun with directors and screenwriters from films such as "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20%28film%20series%29">Harry Potter</a>", "<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%282006%20film%29">Casino Royale</a>" and "<a href="X-Men%20%28film%20series%29">X-Men</a>".

In July 2008, Cecil said he was conversing with small studios from Los Angeles. Although he was interested in making a film, he believed that it was not necessary, since the series was already successful and a bad film could only "damage" its reputation. Cecil said that he was not prepared to "give somebody [he doesn]'t know the editorial control", and that, should the film be created, he would write it himself. He wanted any adaptation to be true to the source material, a film that "enhances [the game] rather than cashes in on it". In May 2009, Cecil stated that he was in discussion with the production company <a href="Radar%20Pictures">Radar Pictures</a>, known for films such as "<a href="The%20Last%20Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>" and "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Riddick">The Chronicles of Riddick</a>", and that he was re-writing the game into a film.

In August 2012, Cecil said that he and Revolution were trying to "find the right partner" to create the film. Cecil believed that "a lot of film makers now in their early 30s played "Broken Sword" the first time around, so they have a lot of affection, and a number of them know a lot about the brand as well." However, he restated his opinion that it "would be much better not to have a movie at all, than to have a bad movie." While Cecil said that Revolution's main focus was the upcoming "Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse", he added that he was "sure there [would] be a film at some point". He also said that he was "sure it will be really good, because [they]'ll do [their] utmost to make sure that it is."

St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery

St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery (, ) is a functioning <a href="monastery">monastery</a> in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, the capital of <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. The monastery is located on the right bank of the <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper River</a> on the edge of a bluff northeast of the <a href="Saint%20Sophia%20Cathedral%20in%20Kiev">Saint Sophia Cathedral</a>. The site is located in the historic administrative Uppertown and overlooks the city's historical commercial and merchant quarter, the <a href="Podil">Podil</a> neighbourhood.

Originally built in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> by <a href="Sviatopolk%20II%20of%20Kiev">Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych</a>, the monastery comprises the Cathedral itself, the Refectory of <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">St. John the Divine</a>, built in 1713, the Economic Gates, constructed in 1760 and the monastery's bell tower, which was added c. 1716–1719. The exterior of the structure was rebuilt in the <a href="Ukrainian%20Baroque">Ukrainian Baroque</a> style in the 18th century while the interior remained in its original <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine</a> style. The original cathedral was demolished by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> authorities in the 1930s, but was reconstructed and opened in 1999 following Ukrainian independence in 1991.

Some scholars do not believe that Prince <a href="Iziaslav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Iziaslav Yaroslavych</a>, whose Christian name was Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kiev near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s. Half a century later, his son, <a href="Sviatopolk%20II%20of%20Kiev">Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych</a>, is recorded as commissioning a monastery church (1108–1113) dedicated to his own patron saint, <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Michael the Archangel</a>. One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic <a href="Polovtsians">Polovtsians</a>, as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories. In 1906, a medieval hoard of silver and gold jewellery was discovered in a metal casket on Trekhsvyatytelska Street (Street of the Three Saints), opposite the gates of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Gold jewellery from the hoard is now in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York while the silver jewellery and two ingots are in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, London. The hoard is dated to the 11th-12th centuries and was probably hidden at the time of the <a href="Mongol%20invasions%20and%20conquests">Tartar invasions</a> and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kiev%20%281240%29">Sack of Kiev</a> in 1240.
The monastery was regarded as a family cloister of Svyatopolk's family; it was there that members of Svyatopolk's family were buried. (This is in contrast to the <a href="Vydubychi%20Monastery">Vydubychi Monastery</a> patronized by his rival, <a href="Vladimir%20Monomakh">Vladimir Monomakh</a>). The cathedral <a href="dome">dome</a>s were probably the first in <a href="Kievan%20Rus">Kievan Rus</a> to be gilded, a practice that became regular with the passage of time and acquired for the monastery the nickname of "golden-domed" or "golden-roofed", depending on the translation.

During the <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus">Mongol invasion</a> in 1240, the monastery is believed to have been damaged seriously. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its gold-plated domes. The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II. After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually became one of the most popular and wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine. In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop%23Eastern%20Orthodox">Orthodox metropolitan</a> of Kiev, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery.

The monastery enjoyed the patronage of <a href="Hetmans%20of%20Ukrainian%20Cossacks">hetmans</a> and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of <a href="Saint%20Barbara">Saint Barbara</a>, alleged to have been brought to Kiev from <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman <a href="Ivan%20Mazepa">Ivan Mazepa</a>. Although most of the monastery grounds were <a href="Secularity">secularized</a> in the late eighteenth century, as many as 240 <a href="monks">monks</a> resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of <a href="Chernihiv">Chernigov</a> after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as <a href="Kyrylo%20Stetsenko">Kyrylo Stetsenko</a> and <a href="Yakiv%20Yatsynevych">Yakiv Yatsynevych</a>, either studied or taught at the school.

In 1870, about 100,000 pilgrims paid tribute to St. Barbara at St. Michael's Monastery. Before the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution in 1917</a>, rings manufactured and blessed at St. Michael's Monastery, known as St. Barbara's rings, were very popular among the citizens of Kiev. They usually served as good luck charms and, according to popular beliefs, occasionally protected against witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses and sudden death. These beliefs reference the facts that the Monastery was not affected by the <a href="bubonic%20plague">plague</a> epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemics of the nineteenth century.

During the first half of the 1930s, various <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> publications questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral. The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine-style cathedral was preserved. This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (previously located in the city of <a href="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a>). Before its demolition (8 June – 9 July 1934), the structure was carefully studied by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the recently <a href="Great%20Purge">purged and re-organized</a> Institute of Material Culture of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Ukraine">Ukrainian Academy of Sciences</a>. On the basis of their survey, the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the <a href="Ukrainian%20Baroque">Ukrainian Baroque</a> style, rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought, and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value. This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities' plans to demolish the entire monastery. Local historians, archaeologists, and architects agreed to the monastery's demolition, although reluctantly. Only one professor, Mykola Makarenko, refused to sign the demolition act; he later died in a Soviet prison.

In the mid-1930s, after the transfer of the Ukrainian capital from Kharkov to Kiev, a decision was made to demolish the cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place. For this purpose, in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for the project of the Governmental Center with a place for parades. In all of the projects submitted for the location in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Square, the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral was demolished, except for one. The project of <a href="Joseph%20Karakis">Joseph Karakis</a> was the only one of four projects submitted for the competition with the location of the center in this place, in which the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral and the monument to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were preserved. However, at the end of the first round, the project of architect Peter Yurchenko was selected by the authorities as the most appropriate.

This project, according to architect <a href="%D0%95%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87">B. Erofalov</a>, "was repeating the general scheme of the Karakis, but was done in a more frontal approach, with the liquidation of the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral. And if the location of the main volumes of the Karakis is asymmetric…" In March 1934, authorities decided to abandon the previous decision and announce a new competition, and at the end to choose the project of architect <a href="Joseph%20Langbard">Joseph Langbard</a>. Meanwhile, according to Oleg Yunakov's research based on archive documents, it is clear that although there is no cathedral in the projects of J. Langbard and P. Yurchenko, that was not the reason for the demolition, since the decision to demolish the monastery was adopted by the resolution of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in February 1934, and the dismantling of mosaics began to be produced already in 1933.

On 26 June 1934, work began on the removal of the twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was conducted by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad <a href="Imperial%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Academy of Fine Arts</a>. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account of the impending demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project. Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic.

The remaining mosaics, covering an area of 45 square metres (485 sq ft), were apportioned among the <a href="State%20Hermitage%20Museum">State Hermitage Museum</a>, the <a href="Tretyakov%20Gallery">Tretyakov Gallery</a>, and the <a href="State%20Russian%20Museum">State Russian Museum</a>. The other remaining mosaics were installed on the second floor of the Saint Sophia Cathedral, where they were not on display for tourists. Those items that remained in Kiev were seized by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and taken to <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. After the war ended, they fell into <a href="United%20States">American</a> hands and were later returned to Moscow.

During the spring of 1935, the golden domes of the monastery were pulled down. The cathedral's silver royal gates, Mazepa's reliquary (weighing two <a href="pood">pood</a>s of silver) and other valuables were sold abroad or simply destroyed. Master Hryhoryi's five-tier <a href="iconostasis">iconostasis</a> was removed (and later destroyed) from the cathedral as well. St. Barbara's relics were transferred to the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Tithes">Church of the Tithes</a> and upon that church's demolition, to the <a href="St%20Volodymyr%27s%20Cathedral">St Volodymyr's Cathedral</a> in 1961.

During the spring-summer period of 1936, the shell of the cathedral and belltower were blown up with <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a>. The monastery's Economic Gate () and the monastic walls were also destroyed. After the demolition, a thorough search for valuables was carried out by the <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> on the site. The resulting empty plot was joined with <a href="Sofiyivska%20Square">Sofiyivska Square</a>, renamed Uryadova Square (Governmental Square) and was designated as the new city center and <a href="parade%20ground">parade ground</a>s. Soviet authorities then commissioned a competition how to best fill the empty plot; most architects, including Yakiv Shteinberg, suggested a huge <a href="Lenin%20statue">Lenin statue</a>. The square itself was planned as a rectangle with huge governmental buildings on the perimeter. Four pillars were planned with statues of workers, peasants and revolutionaries with flags standing on them. Some architects suggested to demolish the statue of <a href="Bohdan%20Khmelnytsky">Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a> in front of the <a href="Saint%20Sophia%20Cathedral%20in%20Kiev">Saint Sophia Cathedral</a> and the Cathedral itself.

The only building completed on the former monastery grounds before World War II currently houses the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Ukraine%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>. The construction of the second building ("the capital center"), planned to be built on the site where the Cathedral had once stood, was delayed in the spring of 1938 as the authorities were not satisfied with the submitted design. This building failed to materialize. Some time after demolition, the site where the former cathedral used to be located was transformed into a sport complex, including <a href="tennis">tennis</a> and <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a> courts. The Refectory () of <a href="St.%20John%20the%20Divine">St. John the Divine</a> was used for changing rooms.

In August 1963, the preserved refectory of the demolished monastery without its Baroque cupola was designated a monument of architecture of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1973, the <a href="Kiev%20City%20Council">Kiev City Council</a> established several "archaeological preservation zones" within the city; these included the territory surrounding the monastery. However, the vacant site of the demolished cathedral was excluded from the proposed Historic-Archaeological Park-Museum, "The Ancient Kiev", developed by architect A. M. Miletskyi and consultants M. V. Kholostenko and P. P. Tolochko.

During the 1970s, Ukrainian architects I. Melnyk, A. Zayika, V. Korol, and engineer A. Kolyakov worked out a plan of reconstruction of the St. Michael's Monastery. However, these plans were only considered after the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">fall of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991.

In 1973-1982 restoration of the Refectory Church of St. John the Theologian (the only building that survived the demolition of the 1930s) was held. Authors of the project - architect V. Shevchenko and architect <a href="Irma%20Karakis">I. Karakis</a> (interiors and furniture). After <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime and voices started to be heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as an important part of the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997–1998, whereupon the cathedral and belltower were transferred to the <a href="Ukrainian%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20the%20Kyivan%20Patriarchate">Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate</a>. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt.

With support of the <a href="Kiev%20City%20Council">Kiev city authorities</a>, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others restored the western part of the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.

The newly rebuilt St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral was officially opened on 30 May 1999. However, interior decorations, mosaics, and frescoes were not completed until 28 May 2000. The side chapels were consecrated to <a href="Saint%20Barbara">SS. Barbara</a> and <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">Catherine</a> in 2001. During the following four years, 18 out of 29 mosaics and other <a href="work%20of%20art">objets d'art</a> from the original cathedral were returned from Moscow after years of tedious discussion between Ukrainian and Russian authorities. However, by the end of 2006, the remaining frescoes of the monastery are going to be transferred from the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> to Kiev. They are placed in a special preserve that is owned by the municipality rather than the church body.

The St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery became the headquarters of the <a href="Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Ukraine">Orthodox Church of Ukraine</a> after the <a href="Unification%20council%20of%20the%20Orthodox%20churches%20of%20Ukraine">church's creation on 15 December 2018</a>. St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery is used as the headquarters of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine. The rector of the monastery has the rank of diocesan bishop.

The <a href="religious%20architecture">religious architecture</a> of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery incorporates elements that have evolved from styles prevalent during <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine</a> and <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> periods. The St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral () is the monastery's main church, built in 1108–1113 at the behest of <a href="Sviatopolk%20II%20of%20Kiev">Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych</a>. The cathedral was the largest of three churches of St. Demetrius Monastery.

The ancient cathedral was modeled on the Assumption Cathedral of the <a href="Kiev%20Pechersk%20Lavra">Kiev Monastery of the Caves</a>. It used the <a href="Greek%20cross">Greek cross</a> plan prevalent during the time of the <a href="Kievan%20Rus">Kievan Rus</a>, six pillars, and three apses. A miniature church, likely a <a href="baptistery">baptistery</a>, adjoined the cathedral from the south. There was also a tower with a staircase leading to the choir loft; it was incorporated into the northern part of the <a href="narthex">narthex</a> rather than protruding from the main block as was common at the time. It is likely that the cathedral had a single dome, although two smaller domes might have topped the tower and baptistery. The interior decoration was lavish as its high-quality shimmering mosaics, probably the finest in Kievan Rus, still testify.

When the medieval churches of Kiev were rebuilt in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the <a href="Ukrainian%20Baroque">Ukrainian Baroque</a> style, the cathedral was enlarged and renovated dramatically. By 1746, it had acquired a new baroque exterior, while maintaining its original Byzantine interior. Six domes were added to the original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es. The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with <a href="stucco">stucco</a>. <a href="Ivan%20Hryhorovych-Barskyi">Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi</a> was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation.

Inside the church, an intricate five-tier <a href="iconostasis">icon screen</a> funded by <a href="Hetman">Hetman</a> <a href="Pavlo%20Skoropadsky">Pavlo Skoropadsky</a> and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from <a href="Chernihiv">Chernigov</a> was installed in 1718. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards the end of the nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.

The refectory of the monastery is a rectangular brick building which contains a dining hall for the brethren as well as several kitchens and pantries. The Church of John the Theologian adjoins it from the east. The outside is segmented by <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and displays window surrounds reminiscent of traditional Eastern Orthodox church architecture. The refectory was erected in 1713, taking the place of the original wooden refectory. Its interior was overhauled in 1827 and 1837 and the restoration work was undertaken from 1976 to 1981.

Simone Russell

Simone Russell is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> on the American <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Passions">Passions</a>", which aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> from 1999 to 2007 and on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> in 2007–08. A member of "Passions" <a href="Russell%20family%20%28Passions%29">Russell family</a>, Simone is introduced as the youngest daughter of <a href="Eve%20Russell">Eve Russell</a> and <a href="T.%20C.%20Russell">T. C. Russell</a>, and the younger sister of <a href="Whitney%20Russell">Whitney Russell</a>. Her early appearances center on her <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> with <a href="Chad%20Harris-Crane">Chad Harris-Crane</a> and her sister Whitney; the character later gains more prominence on the show through her experience coming out as a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> to her family, and her relationship with <a href="Rae%20Thomas">Rae Thomas</a>. The network defended the show's treatment of Simone's sexuality as a serious commentary on the topic.

Simone was created as a part of the show's effort to represent a complete African-American family and fully realized African-American characters on television. Conceived by the soap's founder and <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> <a href="James%20E.%20Reilly">James E. Reilly</a>, the role was portrayed by three actresses over the course of the show: Lena Cardwell (1999–2001), <a href="Chrystee%20Pharris">Chrystee Pharris</a> (2001–2004), and <a href="Cathy%20Jen%C3%A9en%20Doe">Cathy Jenéen Doe</a> (2004–2007). The exact reasons behind Cardwell's departure remain unknown; Pharris chose to leave to pursue other acting opportunities. Doe was the third and final actress to play Simone before the character was written off the show shortly before its transition to DirecTV.

Simone's storyline made daytime television history when "Passions" became the first soap opera to show two women having sex. The character was also daytime television's first African-American lesbian. At the <a href="17th%20GLAAD%20Media%20Awards">17th GLAAD Media Awards</a>, the show won <a href="GLAAD%20Media%20Award%23Categories">Outstanding Daily Drama</a> for its portrayal of Simone's sexual orientation. The show's representation of <a href="LGBT">lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender</a> (LGBT) topics, and Doe's performance as Simone, received a mixed response from critics; Doe was the principal actress during the storylines focusing on the character's sexuality.

<a href="Sheraton%20Kalouria">Sheraton Kalouria</a>, senior vice president of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s daytime programming, described the show's <a href="color-blind%20casting">color-blind casting</a> as part of an effort to build a diverse pool of characters that best reflected the various ethnic and racial groups living in the United States. Kalouria believed the show stood apart from other soap operas by including the African-American <a href="Russell%20family%20%28Passions%29">Russell</a> family and the Hispanic <a href="Lopez-Fitzgerald%20family">Lopez-Fitzgerald</a> family.

Over the course of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), <a href="Chrystee%20Pharris">Chrystee Pharris</a> (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and <a href="Cathy%20Jen%C3%A9en%20Doe">Cathy Jenéen Doe</a> (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). After watching Cardwell's audition for the role, producers Reilly and <a href="Lisa%20de%20Cazotte">Lisa de Cazotte</a> considered Cardwell the ideal choice for Simone. NBC fired Cardwell in the winter of 2001, in a move described as "abrupt" in an article from <a href="Soapcentral">Soapcentral</a>. Cast members expressed disappointment at Cardwell's departure and the character's re-casting. <a href="Tracey%20Ross">Tracey Ross</a>, who portrays <a href="Eve%20Russell">Eve Russell</a>, described Cardwell as being "very sincere, completely authentic and without malice" in her performance. <a href="Rodney%20Van%20Johnson">Rodney Van Johnson</a>, who plays <a href="T.%20C.%20Russell">T. C. Russell</a>, viewed himself as "a father figure to her" and felt that their close relationship helped make the Russell family more authentic and relatable to viewers. After leaving the show, Cardwell said she received a great deal of <a href="fan%20mail">fan mail</a> and that the experience "made [her] feel loved and appreciated."

Pharris assumed the role in 2001, but later decided to not renew her contract in order to pursue other projects. During an interview with "<a href="The%20Christian%20Post">The Christian Post</a>", she said that her time on "Passions" helped her to realize that her occupation as an actress could be used as a platform to advocate for Christianity. Doe was hired for the third and final re-casting after moving to Los Angeles from New York, where she was primarily offered the role of "a runaway teenager, a prostitute, a drug dealer". Initially hesitant to assume a character already established by other actors, she became friendly with Pharris, who answered all of her questions about the character.

Simone was initially characterized by the show's official website through her "major crush on street-kid Chad Harris since he came to town". Daniel R. Coleridge of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" described Simone's early behavior as "bitchy to her older sister, who was nothing but kind to her", while <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>'s Josef referred to the character as a "daredevil teen." When assuming the role in 2001, Pharris said that her preparation consisted of consulting with her friends about Simone, Whitney, and Chad, and incorporating her own life experiences into her interpretation of the character. She commented that working closely with the producers allowed her to draw on her family background for her performance. While discussing the connection to her family, she stated that she used her father's temper as inspiration for playing Simone.

Simone was initially portrayed as one of the series' supporting characters, but gained more prominence during a storyline in which she <a href="Coming%20out">comes out</a> as a lesbian. Kalouria defended the show's treatment of the character's sexuality as a serious commentary on the topic. During an interview about the storyline, he highlighted "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" and "this is where [Simone] is...I can assure you we're not going to make light of this particular topic." During the story arc involving her girlfriend <a href="Rae%20Thomas">Rae Thomas</a>, Simone was noted for her naivety when approaching relationships and sex. Simone's sexuality is initially regarded as "a badge of shame" by the series' characters.

Introduced in the series premiere on July 5, 1999, Simone Russell is the youngest daughter of T. C. and Eve Russell, and the younger sister of Whitney Russell. The family lives in the fictional town of Harmony. Simone's early storylines concentrate on her reluctant participation in her friend <a href="Kay%20Bennett">Kay Bennett</a>'s schemes to separate Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald from <a href="Charity%20Standish">Charity Standish</a> and her attraction to Chad-Harris Crane. Chad and Whitney hide their relationship from Simone to the point where Chad pretends to be Simone's boyfriend to keep her happy. After catching Chad and Whitney having sex, she ends the relationship with him and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with her sister. Disconnected from her sister, Simone becomes close friends with Kay's younger sister <a href="Jessica%20Bennett%20%28Passions%29">Jessica Bennett</a> and Miguel's younger sister <a href="Paloma%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, and turns to them for support. Simone acts primarily in a supporting role for these two characters' storylines, for instance advising Jessica to divorce her abusive husband <a href="Spike%20Lester">Spike Lester</a> and seek professional help for her drug addiction. She briefly dates John Hastings, the son of <a href="David%20Hastings%20%28Passions%29">David Hastings</a>. At the time, John was mistakenly believed to be <a href="Grace%20Standish">Grace Standish</a>'s son and the half-brother of Kay and Jessica. Simone's relationship with John ends in 2004 when he moves to Italy with David and Grace.

In mid-2005, Simone comes out as a lesbian by revealing to her family her relationship with Rae Thomas. The family reacts negatively to her sexual orientation. T. C. beats her and says he is ashamed to be her father. Eve panics and is concerned that her daughter's reputation will suffer if the rest of Harmony learns of her sexuality. Simone's great-aunt, <a href="Irma%20Johnson">Irma Johnson</a>, describes homosexuality as a sin and calls her "vile" and "disgusting". Simone turns to her mother for emotional support after Rae rejects her declarations of love by revealing that she has no interest in a committed relationship. In December 2005, Eve, Julian, Liz, and T. C. find a video from <a href="Alistair%20Crane">Alistair Crane</a> in which he claims to have hired Rae to seduce Simone and "turn" her into a lesbian. Rae later explains that the money is intended to start a lesbian club and that she was never hired to "turn" Simone gay. As she reconciles with Rae, Simone reconnects with her family. Her father, who recently suffered from a stroke following a car accident, apologizes for his homophobic behavior toward her. Her mother also becomes more supportive of her relationship.

Rae finds out <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a> was framing <a href="Luis%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald</a> for his girlfriend <a href="Fancy%20Crane">Fancy Crane</a>'s rape. On February 12, 2007, Vincent stabs Rae to death before she can reveal his identity to Luis. Simone attempts to cope with Rae's death by helping Jessica through her pregnancy. She invites Jessica to live in Rae's old apartment so they can protect the baby from Spike. Eve, who was previously being blackmailed by Vincent, tells Simone the truth about Rae's murder. Simone leaves Harmony with her sister Whitney to start a new life in New Orleans. She does not appear during the show's run on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> or in the <a href="series%20finale">series finale</a>. In July 2008, Simone sends a letter to Kay congratulating her on her wedding to Miguel and includes a pair of earrings as the "<a href="something%20old">something new</a>".

Simone's storyline about coming out as a lesbian received mixed feedback. She was identified as "a character who broke down some barriers for the depiction of lesbians on daytime TV and earned the show awards and accolades from civil rights groups" by a writer from <a href="List%20of%20soap%20opera%20media%20outlets">Soaps.com</a>. "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>"s Aaron Foley saw the show's inclusion of a black, lesbian character as a sign of "America bec[oming] more comfortable with seeing blacks on screen" and viewers "bec[oming] more comfortable with risky, sometimes hilarious storylines". Damon Romine, media entertainment director of <a href="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> (2005–2009), emphasized the show's ability to normalize <a href="LGBT">lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender</a> (LGBT) topics for a wider audience, and opined that the introduction of gay characters made soap operas worth watching. Simone's homosexuality was described as "the most real and moving story on the show" by Soapcentrals Brandi Pine, who found T. C.'s negative reaction to be a realistic portrayal of a parent's difficult in accepting his or her child's sexual orientation. <a href="Sarah%20Warn">Sarah Warn</a>, former editor of entertainment website <a href="AfterEllen.com%20and%20TheBacklot.com">AfterEllen.com</a>, considered the storyline an improvement over a similar one used in "<a href="All%20My%20Children">All My Children</a>". Following the character's departure in 2007, Soaps.com identified Simone as a "charming and strong willed" character who would be remembered for "br[eaking] down some barriers for the depiction of lesbians on daytime TV".

Several <a href="Television%20criticism">television critics</a> had a more negative response to Simone's storyline as a lesbian and to Doe's performance. Warn criticized Simone's relationship with Rae as poorly developed, believing her to be limited to "a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl", and argued that viewers never had the opportunity to "see this woman through her eyes" since the character's sexuality and past relationships with men, and her possible <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a>, were never addressed on screen. Warn also derided the lack of chemistry between Doe and Jossara Jinaro, who plays Rae. Herndon L. Davis of "<a href="Windy%20City%20Times">Windy City Times</a>" felt the representation of Simone as daytime's first African-American lesbian was overshadowed by the show's poor portrayal of Vincent Clarkson. Davis discussed Simone's story arc in his wider criticism of race in daytime television. Rae's death following the reveal of Chad's affair with Vincent was heavily criticized by Mike Perigard of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>", who believed that her removal was only written to maintain a low quota of gay characters on the show.

Simone was the first African-American lesbian to be featured on daytime television. "Passions" also made history by becoming the first daytime television series to show two women having sex. The soap opera won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality and her relationship with Rae, with Doe accepting the award on the show's behalf. Doe was also listed as a pre-nominee for the <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Supporting%20Actress%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series</a> for the <a href="34th%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">34th Daytime Emmy Awards</a> alongside co-star Emily Harper, but was not chosen as one of the final nominees.

Laid down in 1899 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, she was launched on 12 June 1901 and commissioned on 25 October 1902. Her sisters were , , and ; they were the first capital ships built under the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Navy Law of 1898</a>, brought about by <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. The ship, named for the former royal <a href="House%20of%20Z%C3%A4hringen">House of Zähringen</a>, was armed with a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">guns</a> and had a top speed of .

"Zähringen" saw active duty in the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Squadron</a> of the German fleet for the majority of her career. During this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training and making good-will visits to foreign countries. The training exercises conducted during this period provided the framework for the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>'s operations during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She was decommissioned in September 1910, but returned to service briefly for training in 1912, where she accidentally <a href="naval%20ram">rammed</a> and sank a <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>. After the start of World War I in August 1914, "Zähringen" was brought back to active duty in the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a>. The ship saw limited duty in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, including during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, but saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat of British <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s forced the "Kaiserliche Marine" to withdraw older battleships like "Zähringen".

Instead, "Zähringen" was relegated to a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> for <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> training in 1917. In the mid-1920s, "Zähringen" was heavily reconstructed and equipped for use as a radio-controlled target ship. She served in this capacity until 1944, when she was sunk in <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a> by British <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The retreating Germans raised the ship and moved her to the harbor mouth, where they <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> her to block the port. "Zähringen" was broken up "in situ" in 1949–50.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The "Wittelsbach"s were broadly similar to the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.

"Zähringen" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six naval and six <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Zähringen"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men.

"Zähringen"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her <a href="battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">twelve 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four were on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. "Zähringen" was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces, and the <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Zähringen" was ordered under the contract name "E", as a new unit for the fleet. Her <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 21 November 1899, at <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp">Friedrich Krupp</a>'s <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. "Zähringen" was launched on 12 June 1901, with her launching speech given by <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Baden">Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden</a> and head of the <a href="House%20of%20Z%C3%A4hringen">House of Zähringen</a>; his wife, <a href="Princess%20Louise%20of%20Prussia">Grand Duchess Louise</a>, christened the ship. "Zähringen" was commissioned on 25 October 1902, and began her sea trials, which lasted until 10 February 1903. She thereafter replaced the battleship in the I Squadron of the Active Fleet. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to sea and began gunnery training two days later. These exercises continued for the rest of the month, interrupted only by heavy storms.

A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the <a href="Elbe%20river">Elbe river</a> and made their way into the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>. They cruised south to Spain, passing <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> on 14 May and reaching the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off <a href="Pontevedra">Pontevedra</a> before anchoring in <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> on 20 May. The squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Dover">Strait of Dover</a> on 3 June and continued into the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. There, they rendezvoused with the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s of the I "Torpedobootsflotille" (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)—commanded by "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" (Lieutenant Commander) <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>—for a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel. Later in June, the ships took part in additional gunnery training and were present at the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a>. During Kiel Week, an American squadron that included the battleship and four cruisers visited. Following the end of Kiel Week, the I Squadron, which had been strengthened with the new cruiser , and the I "Torpedobootsflotille" went to sea for more tactical and gunnery exercises in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, which lasted from 6 to 28 July. The annual fleet maneuvers began on 15 August; they consisted of a <a href="blockade">blockade</a> exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The year's training schedule concluded with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> that began on 1 December.

"Zähringen" and the rest of I Squadron participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March, and a major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, including a stop at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> on a large scale and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>, after which the ships took the ground troops from the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> that participated in the exercises to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end.

"Zähringen" took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and stopped in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month. The British fleet stopped in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Zähringen" and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In October, the I Squadron went on a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.

The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December.

The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea, which included a stop in <a href="Horta%2C%20Azores">Horta</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. In February 1909, "Zähringen" was employed as an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> for the ports of the western Baltic.

On 21 September 1910, "Zähringen" was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to the new <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> , which had recently been completed. "Zähringen" was then assigned to the Reserve Division of the North Sea, though the unit was dissolved on 12 May 1912, and its ships transferred to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. "Zähringen" was recommissioned briefly, from 9 to 12 May, to transfer her to Kiel. She returned to service again later that year, from 14 August to 28 September, to take part in that year's fleet maneuvers as part of the III Squadron. While exercising on 4 September, "Zähringen" accidentally rammed and sank the torpedo boat . Seven men from "G171" were killed in the accident. "Zähringen" again decommissioned after the conclusion of the exercises, and did not return to service until the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914.

At the start of World War I, "Zähringen" was mobilized as part of the IV Battle Squadron, along with her four sister ships and the battleships and . The squadron was divided into the VII and VIII Divisions, with "Zähringen" assigned to the former. On 26 August, the ships were sent to rescue the stranded <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which had run aground off the island of <a href="Odensholm">Odensholm</a> in the eastern Baltic, but by 28 August, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy "Magdeburg" before the relief force had arrived. As a result, "Zähringen" and the rest of the squadron cruised back toward <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> that day.

Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. Two days later the ships were transferred to the North Sea, though they stayed there only briefly, returning to the Baltic on 20 September. From 22 to 26 September, the squadron took part in a sweep into the eastern Baltic in an unsuccessful attempt to find and destroy Russian warships. From 4 December 1914 to 2 April 1915, the ships of the IV Squadron were tasked with coastal defense duties along Germany's North Sea coast against incursions from the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

The <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> requested naval assistance for its campaign against Russia; <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>, the commander of all naval forces in the Baltic, made the VII Division, the <a href="IV%20Scouting%20Group">IV Scouting Group</a>, and the torpedo boats of the Baltic fleet available for the operation. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. "Zähringen" and the other ships were stationed off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings; the Russians did not do so. After cruisers from the IV Scouting Group encountered Russian cruisers off Gotland, the ships of the VII Division deployed—with a third dummy <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> erected to disguise them as the more powerful s—along with the cruiser . The ships advanced as far as the island of <a href="Ut%C3%B6%20%28Finland%29">Utö</a> on 9 May and to <a href="Kopparstenarna">Kopparstenarna</a> the following day, but by then the Russian cruisers had withdrawn. Later that day, the British submarines and spotted the IV Squadron, but were too far away to attack them.

From 27 May to 4 July, "Zähringen" was back in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the <a href="Jade%20%28river%29">Jade</a>, <a href="Ems%20%28river%29">Ems</a>, and <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> rivers. During this period, the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Admiralty%20Staff">naval high command</a> realized that the old "Wittelsbach"-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to <a href="Neufahrwassar">Neufahrwassar</a>, along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a>, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.

The following month, the naval high command began an operation against the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> in support of the <a href="Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w%20Offensive">Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive</a>. The Baltic naval forces were reinforced with significant elements of the High Seas Fleet, including the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>, the I Scouting Group, the <a href="II%20Scouting%20Group">II Scouting Group</a>, and the II Torpedo-boat Flotilla. Prince Heinrich planned that Schmidt's ships would force their way into the Gulf and destroy the Russian warships in Riga, while the heavy units of the High Seas Fleet would patrol to the north to prevent any of the main Russian <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> that might try to interfere with the operation.

The Germans launched their attack on 8 August, initiating the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>. <a href="Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>s attempted to clear a path through the <a href="Irbe%20Strait">Irbe Strait</a>, covered by "Braunschweig" and "Elsass", while "Zähringen" and the rest of the squadron remained outside the strait. The Russian battleship attacked the Germans in the strait, forcing them to withdraw. During the action, the cruiser and the torpedo boat were damaged by <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> and the torpedo boats and were mined and sunk. Schmidt withdrew his ships to re-coal and Prince Heinrich debated making another attempt, as by that time it had become clear that the German Army's advance toward Riga had stalled. Nevertheless, Prince Heinrich decided to try to force the channel a second time, but now two <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s from the I Squadron would cover the minesweepers. "Zähringen" was instead left behind in Libau.

On 9 September, "Zähringen" and her four sisters sortied in an attempt to locate Russian warships off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. Additionally, the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly "Wittelsbach"-class ships from active service. "Zähringen" and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel; upon arrival the following day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic. The ships were anchored in <a href="Schilksee">Schilksee</a> in Kiel. On 31 January, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties.

"Zähringen" was initially used as a training ship in Kiel. In 1917, the ship was used to train <a href="Fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">stokers</a> but then became a target ship for torpedo boats and the old ironclad , which had by that time become a torpedo training ship. Later, the "Kaiserliche Marine" considered replacing the cruiser , then the gunnery training ship, with "Zähringen", and work began to refit her for this duty on 22 July 1918. The repairs and modifications had not been completed by the end of the war. The ship was left in Germany, and on 13 December was placed out of service.

According to Article 181 of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, "Zähringen" and her sisters were to be demilitarized. This would permit the newly reorganized "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" to retain the vessels for auxiliary purposes. "Zähringen" was therefore stricken from the navy list on 11 March 1920 and disarmed. She was then used as a <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> in Wilhelmshaven until 1926. That year, the "Reichsmarine" decided to rebuild "Zähringen" into a radio-controlled <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>, similar to vessels operated by the Royal Navy and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. The conversion work lasted through 1928.

The ship had its engine system overhauled; the three-shaft arrangement was replaced by a pair of 3-cylinder, vertical triple expansion engines. These were supplied with steam by two naval oil-fired, water-tube boilers. The system was designed to be operated remotely via wireless telegraph, with the receiver located deep inside the ship behind heavy armor protection so it would not be damaged by fire. The new propulsion system provided a top speed of . The superstructure was also cut down, removing all extraneous structures, and the hull was extensively modified. The <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight subdivisions</a> were significantly increased, openings in the hull were sealed, and the ship was filled with some of cork. When the conversion was completed, "Zähringen" displaced . While not in use as a target, the ship was manned by a crew of 67. The torpedo boat was converted for use as "Zähringen"s control vessel, and was renamed "Blitz". She was later replaced by , which was also renamed "Blitz".

"Zähringen" participated in her first gunfire training session on 8 August 1928, in a ceremony held for <a href="President%20of%20Germany%20%281919%E2%80%9345%29">President</a> <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a>. During the exercise, the old battleship "Elsass" fired at "Zähringen". Over the course of the next sixteen years, she served as a target vessel for the "Reichsmarine" and then the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, together with the old battleship . This period revealed that the addition of cork, meant to help keep the ship afloat in the event of a major hull breach, was a poor choice, as it caught fire easily. The modification of the ship's propulsion system also proved to be a mistake, as the ship's speed was too low, and it hindered her maneuverability. These experiences affected the conversion of "Hessen", and neither mistake was repeated when that vessel was converted in the mid-1930s.

"Zähringen" continued on in service through <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, initially based in Wilhelmshaven. "Zähringen", "Hessen", and their radio control boats were assigned to the Inspectorate of Naval Artillery on 1 August 1942. On 18 December 1944, the old ship was hit by bombs during an air raid on <a href="Gotenhafen">Gotenhafen</a> and sank in shallow water. She was temporarily refloated and towed to the harbor entrance, where she was scuttled to block the port on 26 March 1945. The wreck was broken up in situ starting in 1949; work lasted until 1950.

Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C.

Stocksbridge Park Steels Football Club is an English <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in the <a href="Stocksbridge%20and%20Upper%20Don%23Stocksbridge">Stocksbridge</a> area of <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>. They play in Division One South of the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> at level eight of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. The club was formed in 1986 after a merger between two other clubs, and sports a yellow and blue home kit. They play at the Bracken Moor ground.

They initially played in the <a href="Northern%20Counties%20East%20League">Northern Counties East League</a> and progressed through the NCEL's divisions before winning promotion to Division One of the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> (NPL) in 1996. They reached the Premier Division of the NPL in 2009, but were relegated back to Division One South in 2014.

Steels have participated in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> every year since 1992, reaching the 4th qualifying round in 2003, and first entered the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> in 1996 after previously participating in the <a href="FA%20Vase">FA Vase</a>.

Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C. was formed in 1986 as the result of the merger of <a href="Stocksbridge%20Works%20F.C.">Stocksbridge Works</a>, the works team of the local <a href="British%20Steel%20Corporation">British Steel Corporation</a> plant, with another local club, Oxley Park Sports. The new club was immediately admitted to the <a href="Northern%20Counties%20East%20League">Northern Counties East League</a> Division Two, the works club having previously played in Division Three of the same league.

The Steels spent five seasons in Division Two before being placed in Division One when the lower division was discontinued upon league re-organisation in 1991. In the same year Mick Horne was appointed as the club's manager, and he led the team to the championship of Division One in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92</a> season.

In Stocksbridge's first season in the Premier Division the team finished near the bottom of the table, but in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a> season the Steels became Northern Counties East League champions. The club failed to gain promotion to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a>, however, as their stadium did not meet the required standard. The club finished second in the division two seasons later, losing the championship on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a> to <a href="Hatfield%20Main%20F.C.">Hatfield Main</a>, and on this occasion were admitted to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One">Northern Premier League Division One</a>.
Stocksbridge finished in the top half of the table in the club's first five seasons at the higher level, with a best finish of fourth place in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> season, but the following season the Steels finished only two places from the bottom of the league. Shortly before the end of this season, manager Mick Horne tendered his resignation after 11 years in charge and was replaced by his assistant, former <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> player <a href="Wayne%20Biggins">Wayne Biggins</a>.

Under Biggins' management, the Steels had their best ever runs in both the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> and set a club record with a 17–1 defeat of <a href="Oldham%20Town%20F.C.">Oldham Town</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> preliminary round in August 2002, but remained near the bottom of the league table. After the Steels were defeated 6–0 by <a href="Shildon%20F.C.">Shildon</a> in the final qualifying round of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> FA Cup, Biggins attempted to resign but the board of directors persuaded him to continue in his job. However, he left in November 2003, with the club again fighting a battle against <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a>.

Former assistant manager of local rivals <a href="Worksop%20Town%20F.C.">Worksop Town</a> Peter Rinkcavage was appointed as Stocksbridge's new manager, and in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> season he led the team to a sixth-place finish, sufficient to qualify for the play-offs for promotion to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Premier%20Division">Northern Premier League Premier Division</a>. After holding <a href="Kendal%20Town%20F.C.">Kendal Town</a> to a 1–1 draw in the semi-final, the Steels lost a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>, ending their hopes of promotion.

The following season Stocksbridge again finished in sixth place, although with only two teams promoted, it was not high enough to qualify for the play-offs. Stocksbridge did, however, defeat <a href="Worksop%20Town%20F.C.">Worksop Town</a> to win the <a href="Sheffield%20and%20Hallamshire%20Senior%20Cup">Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup</a>. Following this win manager Rinkcavage resigned in order to return to his former club, Worksop, as manager, with Gary Marrow replacing him for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season, for which the club was placed in the Southern section of the now-regionalised Division One. Stocksbridge again qualified for the play-offs, but lost to <a href="Sheffield%20F.C.">Sheffield</a>. In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season, the Steels again qualified for the play-offs and defeated <a href="Belper%20Town%20F.C.">Belper Town</a> in the final to gain promotion to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Premier%20Division">Northern Premier League Premier Division</a> for the first time. During the following season, Marrow resigned as manager and was replaced by <a href="Simon%20Collins%20%28footballer%29">Simon Collins</a>. The Steels spent five years in the Premier Division, never finishing out of the bottom half of the table, and were relegated at the end of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20in%20English%20football">2013–14</a> season.

In 2017, Stocksbridge qualified for the end of season play-offs in their bid to return to the Premier Division, but were beaten in the semi-finals by <a href="Spalding%20United">Spalding United</a>.

The Steels have generally worn a kit of yellow shirts with varying amounts of blue trim, blue shorts, and yellow stockings during their short history. The club badge is predominantly yellow and blue to reflect this, and features a representation of a clock tower located on Nanny Hill, near the club's stadium. The alternative crest was in use by the supporters club from 2006 to 2011 but was never adopted by the club. The official crest was redesigned in 2011 and is still in use (see top of page). The club is unusual in having an alternate crest for its away shirts with the colours reversed. The team's nickname is "Steels" or "The Steels".

The Steels have always played their games at Bracken Moor, the former home of Stocksbridge Works. In 2006 it was announced that the stadium was to be sponsored by local newspaper "Look Local" for a term of five years, resulting in its official name being changed to the Look Local Stadium, a deal which was later extended to 2013. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 3,500, with 450 seats.
The ground was a cricket pitch until shortly after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when it was purchased by a local steelmaking company and converted into a football stadium. Stone-built changing rooms were erected in the mid-1960s, replacing a small hut, as was a seated stand and terracing. The main stand has a distinctive angled awning which extends from the fascia and seats which came from <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>'s <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a>. Floodlights were installed at the stadium in 1990 and the terracing partially covered four years later.

As one side of the ground directly adjoins a cricket pitch, the club was required to erect a dividing fence in order to gain entry to the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a>. The fence is temporary in nature and is removed during the cricket season. It was partially funded by money raised from friendlies against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> and <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>.

The average attendance at the Look Local Stadium was 180 in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season, the ninth highest of twenty teams in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One%20South">Northern Premier League Division One South</a>, with the largest attendance being 451 for the visit of <a href="Sheffield%20F.C.">Sheffield</a>. The average figure was a decrease of 3 compared to the previous season. The highest attendance in the club's history was 2,000, for a friendly match against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> to mark the inauguration of the ground's floodlights in October 1991.

The club has a Supporters' Club which was set up in the mid-1990s. The Supporters' Club organises events to raise funds for the football club, and operates the club shop at the Look Local Stadium.

<a href="Frickley%20Athletic%20F.C.">Frickley Athletic</a> and <a href="Worksop%20Town%20F.C.">Worksop Town</a> are considered to be local rivals to the Steels. Stocksbridge's highest ever league attendance against their rivals is 610 for a match against Worksop.

Stocksbridge's best league finish was a fourth-place finish in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League%20Division%20One">Northern Premier League Division One</a>, which at the time sat at the seventh level in the overall <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>, in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> season. The largest number of points the team has registered in a season was 76 in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> season, but that was only enough to secure a sixth-place finish.

The club's best performance in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> was an appearance in the fourth and final qualifying round in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season. After winning four matches to progress from the preliminary round, the Steels lost 6–0 away to <a href="Shildon%20F.C.">Shildon</a>. In the same season the club achieved its best performance in the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a>, reaching the second round proper only to lose 4–2 away to <a href="Blyth%20Spartans%20F.C.">Blyth Spartans</a>.

The club's record victory was a 17–1 win over <a href="Oldham%20Town%20F.C.">Oldham Town</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 2002. Striker Paul Jackson scored ten of the goals, equalling the 55-year-old record for the most goals scored by a single player in an FA Cup match. <a href="Ted%20McDougall">Ted McDougall</a>'s nine goals for <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a> against <a href="Margate%20F.C.">Margate</a> in 1971 remains the record in the FA Cup proper, whereas Jackson's ten is the record for the qualifying rounds.

Bramshill House

Bramshill House, in <a href="Bramshill">Bramshill</a>, northeast Hampshire, England, is one of the largest and most important <a href="Jacobean%20architecture">Jacobean</a> <a href="prodigy%20house">prodigy house</a> mansions in England. It was built in the early 17th century by <a href="Edward%20la%20Zouche%2C%2011th%20Baron%20Zouche">Baron Edward la Zouche</a> of <a href="Harringworth">Harringworth</a>, but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>, which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1952.

The mansion's southern façade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a large <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a> above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a long gallery containing many portraits. Numerous columns and <a href="frieze">frieze</a>s are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a> depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in of grounds containing an lake. The grounds, which received a Grade II* listing in 1984, are part of a <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Registered Historic Park</a> that includes about of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland.

Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The <a href="cricket">cricket</a> ground at the house played host to a <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> match in 1823 when an early <a href="Hampshire%20county%20cricket%20teams">Hampshire</a> team played an <a href="All-England%20cricket%20teams">England XI</a>, and it hosted three other matches in 1825–26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross <a href="maternity%20hospital">maternity home</a>, before becoming the residence of the exiled King <a href="Michael%20I%20of%20Romania">Michael</a> and <a href="Queen%20Anne%20of%20Romania">Queen Anne of Romania</a> for a number of years. It became the location of the <a href="Police%20Staff%20College%2C%20Bramshill">Police Staff College</a> in 1960, and was later home to the <a href="European%20Police%20College">European Police College</a>. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to <a href="haunted%20house">haunt</a> the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.

Bramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangle formed by <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>, <a href="Basingstoke">Basingstoke</a> and <a href="Farnborough%2C%20Hampshire">Farnborough</a>, about by road southwest of central London. It lies to the northeast of <a href="Hartley%20Wintney">Hartley Wintney</a>, east of <a href="Hazeley">Hazeley</a> off the B3349 road, southeast of the village of <a href="Bramshill">Bramshill</a>, which lies on the B3011 road.
Three main lanes approach the property: Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest, Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north, and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin's Copse, just north of the course of the <a href="River%20Hart">River Hart</a>. There is also a private lane within the grounds, Lower Pool Road, which connects Mansion Drive to Reading Drive South, passing the pond and several outer buildings. The latitudinal and longitudinal location is 51°19'57.9"N 0°54'43.2"W or also, 51.332759, -0.911991.

The 1086 "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" lists one of the two manors of "Bromeselle" (the Anglo-Norman spelling of "Bromshyll") as held by <a href="Hugh%20de%20Port">Hugh de Port</a>, whose family possessed it for nine generations. The last of the de Port line, William de Port (who had assumed the name St. John), died in 1346 without leaving a male heir. 

In the early 14th century, Sir John Foxley, <a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Baron of the Exchequer</a>, (c. 1270 – c. 1325), built and endowed a chapel in the village of Bramshill. His first wife, Constance de Bramshill, may have been the heiress of the Bramshill family. Their son, <a href="Thomas%20Foxley">Thomas Foxley</a> (c. 1305–60), became MP for Berkshire in 1325, and was appointed constable of <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in 1328, soon after the accession of the 14-year-old <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>. In 1347 he obtained a licence to build a <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> or small castle at Bramshill, which included a wooded park. The house, built between 1351 and 1360, had thick walls, vaulted cellars, and an internal courtyard measuring by . Based on the similarity of the surviving vaults under Bramshill House and those under what became the servants' hall and steward's room at Windsor Castle, it may have been a copy of <a href="William%20of%20Wykeham">William of Wykeham</a>'s work there. 

The estate remained in the hands of the Foxley family and their heirs, the Essex family, until 1499, when it was sold to <a href="Giles%20Daubeney%2C%201st%20Baron%20Daubeney">Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney</a>. Giles's son <a href="Henry%20Daubeney%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bridgewater">Henry Daubeney</a> (later Earl of Bridgewater) sold the property to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, and in 1547 <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> granted the estate to <a href="William%20Paulet%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">William Paulet</a>, whose heirs sold it in 1600 to Sir Stephen Thornhurst of <a href="The%20manor%20of%20Agney%2C%20Kent">Agnes Court, Kent</a>.

In March 1605, <a href="Edward%20la%20Zouche%2C%2011th%20Baron%20Zouche">Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche</a>, a favourite of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a>, bought the property from Thornhurst. A house was earlier planned on the site for <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales</a> (1594–1612), whose heraldic <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27s%20feathers">feathers</a> are displayed above the central pediment. Lord Zouche demolished a large part of the building and began to build the Bramshill House of today. <a href="Henry%20Shaw%20%28antiquary%29">Henry Shaw</a> describes the new house which Zouche built as a "specimen of Elizabethan architecture [which] merits particular attention, exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable, with a suite of apartments both large and lofty. The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence."

An inventory taken in 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very high standard. James Zouch, grandson of Edward la Zouche, sold the property to the <a href="Randal%20MacDonnell%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Antrim%20%281645%20creation%29">Earl of Antrim</a> in 1637, at which time the house's furniture was valued at £2,762. During the reign of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, the house was partly destroyed by a fire. On 25 June 1640, Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for £9,500 to Sir Robert Henley. In 1673 it was the property of his son, <a href="Sir%20Andrew%20Henley%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet</a>.

Sir John Cope purchased the property in 1699, and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935. The Cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703, converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century. They were responsible for much of the interior, with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920. After his victory over Napoleon, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> was offered his choice of house by Parliament; he visited Bramshill but in 1817 chose <a href="Stratfield%20Saye%20House">Stratfield Saye</a> instead.

Numerous paintings and prints depict games and social events taking place on the lawn; one such painting by <a href="Joseph%20Nash">Joseph Nash</a>, now in the <a href="British%20National%20Fencing%20Museum">National Fencing Museum</a>, depicts 17th century <a href="rapier">rapier</a> practice, with a number of upper-class men, women and children as spectators.

The <a href="cricket">cricket</a> ground at the house first played host to a <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> match in 1823 when an early <a href="Hampshire%20county%20cricket%20teams">Hampshire</a> team played an <a href="All-England%20cricket%20teams">England XI</a>. Hampshire won by five wickets. Two further first-class matches were played there in 1825, when Hampshire drew against <a href="Godalming%20Cricket%20Club">Godalming</a> and defeated <a href="Sussex%20county%20cricket%20teams">Sussex</a>. A final first-class match was held there in 1826 when a combined Hampshire and <a href="Surrey%20county%20cricket%20teams">Surrey</a> team played and lost to Sussex.
In 1935, the house was purchased from the Cope family by <a href="Ronald%20Nall-Cain%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Brocket">Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket</a>, the house's last private owner. It was used by the Red Cross as a maternity home during the Second World War, after which it became the home of the exiled King <a href="Michael%20I%20of%20Romania">Michael</a> and <a href="Queen%20Anne%20of%20Romania">Queen Anne of Romania</a> for several years.

Bramshill House became a Grade I listed building on 8 July 1952, and was acquired by the British government the following year as a dedicated site for police training. It became the location of the <a href="Police%20Staff%20College%2C%20Bramshill">National Police College</a> in 1960. From 2005, two buildings on the site housed the <a href="European%20Police%20College">European Police College</a> (CEPOL) until this was moved to Budapest in 2014.

By the late 1980s the estate had become expensive to maintain, and according to <a href="John%20Wheeler%20%28British%20politician%29">John Wheeler</a>, Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, by 1989 it was "in a poor state of repair". The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" reported that the police were criticised for subsequent lavish spending on the estate, including £1,800 for a beehive, £750,000 on restoring a bridge and £2 million for the access drive. In July 2013 the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for £25 million, citing costs of £5 million annually to run it. It was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014.

The 15-bedroom Bramshill House is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England, described as one of the "glories of English architecture" by the historians <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a> and <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a>. 

The architecture of the three-storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance, and was executed mainly by German builders. It is approximately in length. The design is traditionally attributed to the architect <a href="John%20Thorpe">John Thorpe</a>, although no records remain to confirm the attribution. 

The building stands on the edge of a plateau, overlooking the park to the south. 
The plan of the house is unusual, partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides. 

Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in <a href="brickwork%23English%20bond">English bond</a> dressed with stone, with <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> <a href="Quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoining</a> at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large <a href="mullion">mullion</a> windows. An open carved <a href="parapet">parapet</a> surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large <a href="gable">gable</a>s on the west side. The <a href="chimney%20stack">chimney stack</a>s are rectangular.

The north façade has three bays separated by windows and features a <a href="loggia">loggia</a>, typical of early 17th-century houses, with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched <a href="Dutch%20gable">Dutch gable</a>, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s at either side of the gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.

The southern façade was described by <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as "among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in [England]". It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing, with five inner sections. 

The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows, aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor. The inner two sections have the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor, but the ground floor features two arches, which form part of the central loggia. 

The stone central bay, wide, is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a>, <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a>, and <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian</a> orders, surmounted by a florid perforated pediment. In addition there is an <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a> on the first floor above the main entrance.

An important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace, in width, between the projecting wings, a kind of architectural foreground to the garden. The terrace is bounded by a high <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a>. The arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of Italian domestic architecture, used in villas. The <a href="triglyph">triglyph</a>s and ornamented <a href="metope%20%28architecture%29">metope</a>s, together with the simple capitals of the columns, indicate the Doric order, but are light enough to be Ionic. The south entrance was the model for Darlington, the <a href="Crocker-McMillin%20Mansion">Crocker-McMillin Mansion</a> in New Jersey, USA, built between 1901 and 1907.

The east façade is the longest, about wide, and two storeys high. It features four full-height angular bays with two windows between, while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel. On this side there is a <a href="trucco">Troco</a> Terrace with a lawn, as well as two <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcaded</a> openings at the side on either wing of the house. 

The southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables, one of which is older and octagonal. Carved in the wall at the side is a <a href="frieze">frieze</a> consisting of four squares, each depicting an animal: a lion, an elephant, a wild boar and a camel.

The west façade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables; the windows on the ground floor are sashed.

Two of the rooms have large tapestries on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those in the drawing room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for <a href="Dudley%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dorchester">Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester</a>, Zouche's brother-diplomat, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a> (Munich).

The ground floor contains, in the west section, the former dining room and kitchen. The openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.

The Great Hall, to which an arcaded porch gives direct access, retains the basic design of the original construction. It has a <a href="dais">dais</a> and a Jacobean stone screen, high, decorated with 92 shields. Resident families emblazoned the shields with the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> of ancestors and family members. The <a href="entablature">entablature</a> of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of . Beyond the dais, double doors lead into the Terrace Hall at the foot of the staircase. Across from this is the former dining room, containing a large tapestry, believed to have been made by an English artist, "representing forest scenery in very subdued colours". During the time of the Cope family in the 1880s, the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy. The kitchen and the adjoining room had back-to-back fireplaces.

The drawing room, containing four bay windows of different sizes, is panelled with oak for its entire height of about . One of the upper panels, surmounted by its Corinthian entablature, is a frieze depicting a <a href="Common%20fig">fig</a>, <a href="grape">grape</a>, and <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a>, each with foliage and blossoms. One of the lower panels, part of the <a href="Dado%20%28architecture%29">dado</a> in the same room, has a section of projecting <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moulding</a>s. The upper panel is by ; the lower, by .

The massive <a href="Fireplace%20mantel">chimneypiece</a> in the drawing room is classically designed, believed to be inspired by one of the great Italian architects of 16th-century <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a>, <a href="Giacomo%20Barozzi%20da%20Vignola">Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola</a>. It is two storeys in height, the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic. The distribution of the members is regular, and the shafts of the columns are variegated <a href="marble">marble</a>. The upper compartment of the chimney-piece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material, and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre. The fireplace is wide and high, and retains the ancient <a href="andiron">andiron</a>s, used for burning wood. These are large and well adorned, particularly in the lower part.

The ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house. The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship; wide, it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern, with an evident <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> influence. In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5,000 volumes, about half the number the Cope family owned at the time.

The standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from <a href="Eversley%20Manor%20House">Eversley Manor House</a> and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. The walls above the stairs and on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.

Beyond the staircase are the state rooms and what was known as the "Wrought Room". The room has an ornamental ceiling with a Renaissance chimneypiece. Two of the bedrooms, the two "White Rooms", were originally connected to what was called the Flower-de-luce Room, but the doors have been boarded up.

The Long Gallery fills the first floor of the northern range: long and with a richly decorated <a href="stucco">stucco</a> ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece, it formerly contained a "very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters".

Also on the first floor is the "Chapel Drawing Room" in the south wing, connected to the Drawing Room. The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel, which is entered through it. The current chapel has an altar <a href="reredos">reredos</a> with paintings of the Virgin Mary, St. Stephen, St. Mary Magdalene and St. John the Evangelist, by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840. The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house, and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier; in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room. When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope, it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood. The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel.

The house is set in of grounds, which include an lake north of the house. The grounds form part of a <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Registered Historic Park</a> that received a Grade II* listing in 1984; this was subsequently upgraded to Grade I in September 2017. Under this designation are the of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house, the wider medieval park, landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century, with of woodland and buildings including an icehouse and a <a href="folly">folly</a> known as Conduit House. Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century.

To the west of the house is Peatmoor Copse and to the east Bramshill Forest, and the grounds contained what was known as the "Green Court" and the "Flower Garden" at the time of William Henry Cope in the 1880s. The Grade I listed gatehouse dates to the time of the Foxleys. The fir trees in the grounds are reputed to have been planted "as a memento of his former home" by James I, who brought them from Scotland. The formal gardens were first laid out by Edward la Zouche, a horticulturist. Sir John Cope redesigned the gardens and continued the planting of trees in the park. At the close of the 18th century the grounds were re-landscaped to be less formal, and some areas in the south were returned to parkland.
Bramshill Park was conceived as a "hunting box" for Henry Frederick and became a popular estate for hunting. On 24 July 1621, while hunting in the park, <a href="George%20Abbot%20%28Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury%29">George Abbot</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, accidentally shot and killed one of the gamekeepers with his crossbow. An inquiry cleared him of murder. Another notable clergyman/hunter who frequented Bramshill was <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, rector of Eversley, who hunted fox and deer and collected butterflies there and frequently took his family and friends. Kingsley was reportedly especially enamoured of the fir trees, which he considered "a source of constant delight", fondly naming them "James the First's gnarled giants". In the 19th century, Sir John Cope, a friend of Kingsley's, was known as a supporter of the fox hunt and especially as a breeder of fox hounds. The opening of the season at Bramshill in the late 1840s was noted in the British hunting press.

The main avenue approaches from the southwest, through an arched gateway formed by two Grade II listed early 19th-century lodges, before crossing the Broad Water formed by the River Hart by a Grade I listed early 19th-century bridge with two arches. There are separate listings for other structures near the house, including the Grade I listed early 17th-century triple-arched gateway on the route to <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> to the northeast of the house, Grade I listed early 17th-century boundary walls and turrets to the south and west, Grade II listed boundary walls and gate-piers to the west, including the kitchen garden, Grade I listed garden walls and gateways to the north and east, and the Grade II listed late 18th-century stable block to the north.

Bramshill has been cited as one of the most <a href="Haunted%20house">haunted</a> houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, although another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, according to the author Penny Legg). 

The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. 

The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the <a href="Lily%20of%20the%20valley">lilies of the valley</a>; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. 

The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. 

A lady dressed in the style of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. 

A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.

In addition, Bramshill House was cited by the historian <a href="William%20Henry%20Page">William Page</a> as a possible location for the <a href="Legend%20of%20the%20Mistletoe%20Bough">Legend of the Mistletoe Bough</a>, a ghost story associated with several English country mansions. This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of <a href="hide%20and%20seek">hide and seek</a> on her wedding night. In the case of Bramshill House, the story has it that this happened at Christmas time, and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand; the chest is on display in the entrance hall. 

The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope's daughter Anne, who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire. An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini, who was married in 1727, and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest. In his monograph on the house, the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original, which had been proved large enough by "a woman of comely proportions" who had tested it by lying down in it, but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope's widow in 1812. 

The ghost of the bride is referred to as the White Lady, and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room. According to Legg, <a href="Michael%20I%20of%20Romania">Michael I of Romania</a> asked to be moved to another room during a stay there, in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night. 

An old man with a grey beard, thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady, is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest.

S-50 (Manhattan Project)

The S-50 Project was the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>'s effort to produce <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> by <a href="thermophoresis">liquid thermal diffusion</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was one of three technologies for uranium enrichment pursued by the Manhattan Project.

The liquid thermal diffusion process was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by <a href="Philip%20H.%20Abelson">Philip H. Abelson</a> and other scientists at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a>. This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> also played a part.

Pilot plants were built at the <a href="Naval%20Support%20Facility%20Anacostia">Anacostia Naval Air Station</a> and the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a>, and a production facility at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 <a href="calutron">calutron</a>s and the <a href="K-25">K-25</a> <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> bomb employed in the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a> by a week.

The S-50 plant ceased production in September 1945, but it was reopened in May 1946, and used by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> <a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20for%20the%20Propulsion%20of%20Aircraft">Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft</a> (NEPA) project. The plant was demolished in the late 1940s.

The discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a> by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> in 1932, followed by that of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> by the German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Robert%20Frisch">Otto Robert Frisch</a> soon after, opened up the possibility of a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> with uranium. Fears that a <a href="German%20atomic%20bomb%20project">German atomic bomb project</a> would develop <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the <a href="Einstein-Szilard%20letter">Einstein-Szilard letter</a>. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.

<a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a> applied the <a href="liquid%20drop%20model">liquid drop model</a> of the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies was due to the <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> isotope. The former makes up 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of <a href="uranium-234">uranium-234</a>, 0.006 percent.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> in Britain, the Australian physicist <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a> assigned two refugee physicists—Frisch and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a>—the task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like <a href="radar">radar</a>. Their March 1940 <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a> indicated that the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of uranium-235 was within an <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order of magnitude</a> of 10 kg, which was small enough to be carried by a <a href="bomber">bomber</a> of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (<a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a>) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.

The liquid thermal diffusion process was based on the discovery by <a href="Carl%20Ludwig">Carl Ludwig</a> in 1856 and later <a href="Charles%20Soret">Charles Soret</a> in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is known as the <a href="Soret%20effect">Soret effect</a>. <a href="David%20Enskog">David Enskog</a> in 1911 and <a href="Sydney%20Chapman%20%28mathematician%29">Sydney Chapman</a> in 1916 independently developed the <a href="Chapman%E2%80%93Enskog%20theory">Chapman–Enskog theory</a>, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F. W. Dootson in 1916.

Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of <a href="isotope%20separation">isotope separation</a>. This process was first demonstrated by <a href="Klaus%20Clusius">Klaus Clusius</a> and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938, who used it to separate isotopes of <a href="neon">neon</a>. They used an apparatus called a "column", consisting of a vertical tube with a hot wire down the center. In the United States, Arthur Bramley at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> improved on this design by using concentric tubes with different temperatures.

<a href="Philip%20H.%20Abelson">Philip H. Abelson</a> was a young physicist who had been awarded his <a href="PhD">PhD</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> on 8 May 1939. He was among the first American scientists to verify nuclear fission, reporting his results in an article submitted to the <a href="Physical%20Review">Physical Review</a> in February 1939, and collaborated with <a href="Edwin%20McMillan">Edwin McMillan</a> on the discovery of <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>. Returning to the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20for%20Science">Carnegie Institution</a> in Washington, D.C., where he had a position, he became interested in isotope separation. In July 1940, <a href="Ross%20Gunn">Ross Gunn</a> from the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a> (NRL) showed him a 1939 paper on the subject by <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>, and Abelson became intrigued by the possibility of using the liquid thermal diffusion process. He began experiments with the process at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution. Using <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a> (KCl), <a href="potassium%20bromide">potassium bromide</a> (KBr), <a href="potassium%20sulfate">potassium sulfate</a> () and <a href="potassium%20dichromate">potassium dichromate</a> (), he was able to achieve a separation factor of 1.2 (20 percent) of the <a href="potassium-39">potassium-39</a> and <a href="potassium-41">potassium-41</a> isotopes.

The next step was to repeat the experiments with uranium. He studied the process with aqueous solutions of uranium salts, but found that they tended to <a href="Hydrolysis">be hydrolyzed</a> in the column. Only <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> () seemed suitable. In September 1940, Abelson approached Ross Gunn and <a href="Lyman%20J.%20Briggs">Lyman J. Briggs</a>, the director of the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>, who were both members of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) <a href="Uranium%20Committee">Uranium Committee</a>. The NRL agreed to make $2,500 available to the Carnegie Institution to allow Abelson to continue his work, and in October 1940, Briggs arranged for it to be moved to the Bureau of Standards, where there were better facilities.

Uranium hexafluoride was not readily available, so Abelson devised his own method of producing it in quantity at the NRL, through fluoridation of the more easily produced <a href="uranium%20tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a> at . Initially, this small plant supplied uranium hexafluoride for the research at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> and the NRL. In 1941, Gunn and Abelson placed an order for uranium hexafluoride with the Harshaw Chemical Company in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, using Abelson's process. In early 1942, the NDRC awarded Harshaw a contract to build a pilot plant to produce of uranium hexafluoride per day. By the spring of 1942, Harshaw's pilot uranium hexafluoride plant was operational, and <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> also began experiments with using the process. Demand for uranium hexafluoride soon rose sharply, and Harshaw and DuPont increased production to meet it.

Abelson erected eleven columns at the Bureau of Standards, all approximately in diameter, but ranging from high. Test runs were carried out with potassium salts, and then, in April 1941, with uranium hexafluoride. On 1 June 1941, Abelson became an employee of the NRL, and he moved to the <a href="Naval%20Support%20Facility%20Anacostia">Anacostia Naval Air Station</a>. In September 1941, he was joined by John I. Hoover, who became his deputy. They constructed an experimental plant there with columns. Steam was provided by a gas-fired boiler. They were able to separate isotopes of <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, but the apparatus was ruined in November by the decomposition products of the <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a>. The next run indicated 2.5% separation, and it was found that the optimal spacing of the columns was between . Abelson regarded a run on 22 June with a 9.6% result as the first successful test of liquid thermal diffusion with uranium hexafluoride. In July, he was able to achieve 21%.

The NRL authorized a pilot plant in July 1942, which commenced operation on 15 November. This time they used fourteen columns, with a separation of between them. The pilot plant ran without interruption from 3 to 17 December 1942. <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, who had been designated to take charge of what would become known as the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> (but would not do so for another two days), visited the pilot plant with the Deputy District Engineer of the Manhattan District, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Kenneth%20D.%20Nichols">Kenneth D. Nichols</a> on 21 September, and spoke with Gunn and <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Harold%20G.%20Bowen%2C%20Sr.">Harold G. Bowen, Sr.</a>, the director the NRL. Groves left with the impression that the project was not being pursued with sufficient urgency. The project was expanded, and <a href="Nathan%20Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> joined the project as a theoretical physicist. Groves visited the pilot plant again on 10 December 1942, this time with <a href="Warren%20K.%20Lewis">Warren K. Lewis</a>, a professor of <a href="chemical%20engineering">chemical engineering</a> from <a href="MIT">MIT</a>, and three DuPont employees. In his report Lewis recommended that the work be continued.
The S-1 Executive Committee superseded the Uranium Committee on 19 June 1942, dropping Gunn from its membership in the process. It considered Lewis' report, and passed on its recommendation to <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, the director of the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), of which the S-1 Executive Committee was a part. The relationship between the OSRD and the NRL was not good; Bowen criticised it for diverting funds from the NRL. Bush was mindful of a 17 March 1942 directive from the president, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, albeit on his advice, that the navy was to be excluded from the Manhattan Project. He preferred to work with the more congenial <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Henry%20Stimson">Henry Stimson</a>, over whom he had more influence.

<a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the chairman of the NDRC and the S-1 Executive Committee, was concerned that the navy was running its own nuclear project, but Bush felt that it did no harm. He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in <a href="nuclear%20marine%20propulsion">nuclear marine propulsion</a> for <a href="nuclear%20submarine">nuclear submarine</a>s. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, and all he needed was details about <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a> design, which he knew was being pursued by the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> in Chicago. He was unaware that it had already built <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a>, a fellow member of the Military Policy Committee that ran the Manhattan Project, for Abelson's efforts to receive additional support.

The following week, Briggs, Urey, and <a href="Eger%20V.%20Murphree">Eger V. Murphree</a> from the S-1 Executive Committee, along with Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from <a href="ExxonMobil">Standard Oil</a>, visited the pilot plant at Anacostia. They were impressed with the simplicity of the process, but disappointed that no enriched uranium product had been withdrawn from the plant; production had been calculated by measuring the difference in concentration. They calculated that a liquid thermal diffusion plant capable of producing 1 kg per day of uranium enriched to 90% uranium-235 would require 21,800 columns, each with a separation factor of 30.7%. It would take 18 months to build, assuming the use of the Manhattan Project's overriding priority for materials. This included of scarce <a href="copper">copper</a> for the outer tubes and <a href="nickel">nickel</a> for the inner, which would be required to resist corrosion by the steam and uranium hexafluoride respectively.

The estimated cost of such a plant was around $32.6 million to build and $62,600 per day to run. What killed the proposal was that the plant would require 600 days to reach equilibrium, by which time $72 million would have been spent, which the S-1 Executive Committee rounded up to $75 million. Assuming that work started immediately, and the plant worked as designed, no enriched uranium could be produced before 1946. Murphree suggested that a liquid thermal diffusion plant producing uranium enriched to 10% uranium-235 might be a substitute for the lower stages of a <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> plant, but the S-1 Executive Committee decided against this. Between February and July 1943 the Anacostia pilot plant produced of slightly enriched uranium hexafluoride, which was shipped to the Metallurgical Laboratory. In September 1943, the S-1 Executive Committee decided that no more uranium hexafluoride would be allocated to the NRL, although it would exchange enriched uranium hexafluoride for regular uranium hexafluoride. Groves turned down an order from the NRL for additional uranium hexafluoride in October 1943. When it was pointed out that the navy had developed the production process for uranium hexafluoride in the first place, the army reluctantly agreed to fulfil the order.

Abelson's studies indicated that in order to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a>, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral <a href="Earle%20W.%20Mills">Earle W. Mills</a>, the Assistant Chief of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ships">Bureau of Ships</a> on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="Thorvald%20A.%20Solberg">Thorvald A. Solberg</a> from the Bureau of Ships was project officer.

The Philadelphia pilot plant occupied of space on a site one block west of <a href="Broad%20Street%20%28Philadelphia%29">Broad Street</a>, near the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>. The plant consisted of 102 columns, known as a "rack", arranged into a cascade of seven stages. The plant was intended to be able to produce one gram per day of uranium enriched to 6% uranium-235. The outer copper tubes were cooled by water flowing between them and the external 4-inch steel pipes. The inner nickel tubes were heated by high pressure steam at and . Each column therefore held about of uranium hexafluoride. This was driven by vapor pressure; the only working parts were the water pumps. In operation, the rack consumed 11.6 MW of power. Each column was connected to a reservoir of of uranium hexafluoride. Because of the dangers involved in handling uranium hexafluoride, all work with it, such as replenishing the reservoirs from the shipping cylinders, was accomplished in a transfer room. The columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, so the Philadelphia pilot plant eventually produced over of uranium hexafluoride enriched to 0.86 percent uranium-235, which was handed over to the Manhattan Project. The Philadelphia pilot plant was disposed of in September 1946, with salvageable equipment being returned to the NRL, while the rest was dumped at sea.

In early 1944, news of the Philadelphia pilot plant reached <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the director of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>. Oppenheimer wrote to Conant on 4 March 1944, and asked for the reports on the liquid thermal diffusion project, which Conant forwarded. Like nearly everyone else, Oppenheimer had been thinking of uranium enrichment in terms of a process to produce <a href="weapons%20grade%20uranium">weapons grade uranium</a> suitable for use in an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, but now he considered another option. If the columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, then it might produce 12 kg per day of uranium enriched to 1 percent. This could be valuable because an electromagnetic enrichment process that could produce one gram of uranium enriched to 40 percent uranium-235 from natural uranium, could produce two grams per day of uranium enriched to 80 percent uranium-235 if the feed was enriched to 1.4 percent uranium-235, double the 0.7 percent of natural uranium. On 28 April, he wrote to Groves, pointing out that "the production of the <a href="calutron">Y-12</a> plant could be increased by some 30 or 40 percent, and its enhancement somewhat improved, many months earlier than the scheduled date for <a href="K-25">K-25</a> production."

Groves obtained permission from the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphree, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed to meet the requirements of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a>. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50 kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphree, Tolman, Cohen and Thompson estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945.
Sites at <a href="Watts%20Bar%20Dam">Watts Bar Dam</a>, <a href="Muscle%20Shoals%2C%20Alabama">Muscle Shoals</a> and <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> were considered, but it was decided to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be obtained from the <a href="Clinch%20River">Clinch River</a> and steam from the K-25 powerhouse. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the <a href="Prairie%2C%20Mississippi">Gulf Ordnance Plant</a> in Mississippi, on a <a href="Cost-plus%20contract">cost plus fixed fee</a> contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.

Groves, Tolman, Fox, and Wells N. Thompson from H. K. Ferguson, collected blueprints of the Philadelphia pilot from there on 26 June. The production plant would consist of twenty-one 102-column racks, arranged in three groups of seven, a total of 2,142 columns. Each rack was a copy of the Philadelphia pilot plant. The columns had to be manufactured to fine tolerances; ± for the diameter of the inner nickel tubes, and ± between the inner nickel tubes and the outer copper tubes. The first orders for columns were placed on 5 July. Twenty-three companies were approached, and the Grinnell Company of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, and the Mehring and Hanson Company of Washington, D.C., accepted the challenge.

Ground was broken at the site on 9 July 1944. By 16 September, with about a third of the plant complete, the first rack had commenced operation. Testing in September and October revealed problems with leaking pipes that required further welding. Nonetheless, all racks were installed and ready for operations in January 1945. The construction contract was terminated on 15 February, and the remaining insulation and electrical work was assigned to other firms in the Oak Ridge area. They also completed the auxiliary buildings, including the new steam plant. The plant became fully operational in March 1945. Construction of the new boiler plant was approved on 16 February 1945. The first boiler was started on 5 July 1945, and operations commenced on 13 July. Work was completed on 15 August 1945.
The Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) was a black structure long, wide, and high. There was one control room and one transfer room for each pair of racks, except for the final one, which had its own control and transfer rooms for training purposes. Four pumps drew per minute of cooling water from the Clinch River. Steam pumps were specially designed by Pacific Pumps Inc. The plant was designed to use the entire output of the K-25 powerhouse, but as K-25 stages came online there was competition for this. It was decided to build a new boiler plant. Twelve surplus boilers originally intended for <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a>s were acquired from the navy. The lower hot wall temperature due to the reduced steam pressure ( instead of the of the pilot plant) was compensated for by the ease of operation. Because they were oil-fired, a oil tank farm was added, with sufficient storage to operate the plant for 60 days. In addition to the Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) and the new steam plant (F06) buildings, structures in the S-50 area included the <a href="pumping%20station">pumping station</a> (F02), laboratories, a cafeteria, machine shop (F10), warehouses, a gas station, and a water treatment plant (F03).

For security reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson to operate the new plant, but it was a <a href="closed%20shop">closed shop</a>, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned <a href="subsidiary">subsidiary</a>, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it to operate the plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten <a href="enlisted%20men">enlisted men</a> of the <a href="Special%20Engineer%20Detachment">Special Engineer Detachment</a> (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.
On 2 September 1944, SED <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">Private</a> <a href="Arnold%20Kramish">Arnold Kramish</a>, and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg, Jr., an NRL chemical engineer, and Douglas P. Meigs, a Fercleve employee, were working in a transfer room when a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride exploded, rupturing nearby steam pipes. The steam reacted with the uranium hexafluoride to create <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a>, and the three men were badly burned. Private <a href="John%20D.%20Hoffman">John D. Hoffman</a> ran through the toxic cloud to rescue them, but Bragg and Meigs died from their injuries. Another eleven men, including Kramish and four other soldiers, were injured but recovered. Hoffman, who suffered burns, was awarded the <a href="Soldier%27s%20Medal">Soldier's Medal</a>, the United States Army's highest award for an act of valor in a non-combat situation, and the only one awarded to a member of the Manhattan District. Bragg was posthumously awarded the <a href="Navy%20Meritorious%20Civilian%20Service%20Award">Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award</a> on 21 June 1993.

Colonel <a href="Stafford%20L.%20Warren">Stafford L. Warren</a>, the chief of the Manhattan District's Medical Section, removed the internal organs of the dead and sent them back to Oak Ridge for analysis. They were buried without them. An investigation found that the accident was caused by the use of steel cylinders with nickel linings instead of seamless nickel cylinders because the army had pre-empted nickel production. The Navy Hospital did not have procedures for the treatment of people exposed to uranium hexafluoride, so Warren's Medical Section developed them. Groves ordered a halt to training at the Philadelphia pilot plant, so Abelson and 15 of his staff moved to Oak Ridge to train personnel there.

There were no fatal accidents at the production plant, although it had a higher accident rate than other Manhattan Project production facilities due to the haste to get it into operation. When the crews attempted to start the first rack there was a loud noise and a cloud of vapor due to escaping steam. This would normally have resulted in a shutdown, but under the pressure to get the plant operational, the Fercleve plant manager had no choice but to press on. The plant produced just of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced . In normal operation, of product was drawn from each circuit every 285 minutes. With four circuits per rack, each rack could produce per day. By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons. Total S-50 production was . It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> bomb employed in the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a> by a week. "If I had appreciated the possibilities of thermal diffusion," Groves later wrote, "we would have gone ahead with it much sooner, taken a bit more time on the design of the plant and made it much bigger and better. Its effect on our production of U-235 in June and July 1945 would have been appreciable."
Soon after the war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Arthur%20V.%20Peterson">Arthur V. Peterson</a>, the Manhattan District officer with overall responsibility for the production of <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on stand-by. The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were drained and cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending <a href="termination%20of%20employment">termination of employment</a>. All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last uranium hexafluoride feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. <a href="Layoff">Layoff</a>s began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946.

Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant buildings were utilised, not as a production facility, but by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' <a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20for%20the%20Propulsion%20of%20Aircraft">Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft</a> (NEPA) project. <a href="Fairchild%20Aircraft">Fairchild Aircraft</a> conducted a series of experiments there involving <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a>. Workers also fabricated blocks of enriched uranium and <a href="graphite">graphite</a>. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a>-<a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> <a href="Aircraft%20Nuclear%20Propulsion">Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion</a> project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.

2005 Texas Longhorns football team

The 2005 Texas Longhorns football team represented the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> during the <a href="2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2005 NCAA Division I-A football season</a>, winning the <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12 Conference</a> championship and the <a href="College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS">national championship</a>. The team was coached by <a href="Mack%20Brown">Mack Brown</a>, led on <a href="Offensive%20line">offense</a> by <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Vince%20Young">Vince Young</a>, and played its home games at <a href="Darrell%20K.%20Royal%20%E2%80%93%20Texas%20Memorial%20Stadium">Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium</a>.

The team's penultimate victory of the season, the <a href="Big%2012%20Football%20Championship%20Game">Big 12 Championship Game</a>, featured the biggest margin of victory in the history of that contest. They finished the season by winning the <a href="2006%20Rose%20Bowl">2006 Rose Bowl</a> against the <a href="2005%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team">USC Trojans</a> for the national championship. Numerous publications have cited this victory as standing among the greatest performances in <a href="History%20of%20American%20football">college football history</a>, and <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> awarded the 2006 <a href="ESPY%20Award">ESPY Award</a> for the "Best Game" in any sport to the Longhorns and the Trojans. The Longhorns finished as the only unbeaten team in <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I-A">NCAA Division I-A</a> football that year, with thirteen wins and zero losses.<ref name="Win/Loss">College football team records are conventionally expressed in number of wins/losses. 13–0 means 13 wins and zero losses.</ref>

Texas earned its second Big 12 Conference football championship to make 27 conference championships total, including 25 in the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a>. It was their fourth <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20national%20football%20championship%23Rankings%20overview">national championship</a> in football and the ninth <a href="List%20of%20undefeated%20Division%20I-A%20football%20teams">perfect season</a> in the history of Longhorn football.

The team set numerous school and <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> records, including their <a href="list%20of%20500%20point%20seasons%20in%20college%20football">652 points</a> which set an NCAA record for points scored in a season. After the season ended, six Longhorns from this championship team joined professional football teams through the <a href="2006%20NFL%20Draft">2006 NFL Draft</a>. Seven more Longhorns followed suit in the <a href="2007%20NFL%20Draft">2007 NFL Draft</a> and they were joined by two free agents. Another nine followed through the <a href="2008%20NFL%20Draft">2008 Draft</a> and free-agency to make a total of twenty-four players who entered into the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL).

Media and fans of college football consider the UT program one of the great powerhouses of the game because of the school's winning record as well as their previous national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970. From 1936 to 2004, the team finished the season in the top ten team of the <a href="Associated%20Press%20Poll">Associated Press Poll</a> 23 times, or one-third of the time. At the start of the 2005 season, the Longhorns were one of the most victorious programs in college football history; they were third in total victories and fourth if measured by winning percentage.

In the <a href="2004%20Texas%20Longhorn%20football%20team">2004 season</a> <a href="Vince%20Young">Vince Young</a> led the team to the <a href="2005%20Rose%20Bowl">2005 Rose Bowl</a>, the school's first <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) game, and a top 5 finish in the major polls. It should also be noted that Vince Young predicted that the Longhorns would return to the Rose Bowl next season in a post game interview where he proclaimed, "We'll be back!" Young returned for the 2005–2006 season, as did most of the other key players from 2004–2005, with the exception of <a href="Cedric%20Benson">Cedric Benson</a>, <a href="Derrick%20Johnson">Derrick Johnson</a>, and <a href="Bo%20Scaife">Bo Scaife</a>. Texas was given a pre-season No. 2 ranking (behind the defending National Champions, the University of Southern California) by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" magazine, the <a href="Associated%20Press%20Poll">Associated Press Poll</a> and the "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" <a href="Coaches%20Poll">Coaches Poll</a>.

During the summer of 2005, a period free of official team practices, Young and his receivers spent extra practice time working on their timing and team-work. The fall Orange and White intra-team <a href="Exhibition%20game">scrimmage</a> was held on August 21, 2005, as an event open to the public. <a href="Running%20back">Running back</a> <a href="Ramonce%20Taylor">Ramonce Taylor</a> returned the opening <a href="kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> 94 <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23Y">yards</a> for a <a href="Time%20of%20possession">touchdown</a>. Young completed five of seven <a href="Forward%20pass">passing</a> attempts for 68 yards and one touchdown. Senior <a href="Richmond%20McGee">Richmond McGee</a> made two 33-yard <a href="field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goals</a> and emerged as the top candidate to handle field goals, kickoffs and <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punts</a>. Brown said of McGee, "We've never had one person do all three, so it's a concern, but right now, he would be the guy."

The success of the 2004 team and the efforts during the off-season fueled anticipation by sports writers that Texas would play for the national championship if they could win their away game against <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> and end their five-game losing streak against <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>. The BCS system required any team competing in the championship game to be ranked either number one or number two in the <a href="BCS%20rankings">BCS Standings</a> at the end of the season.

The final roster of the season:

Texas had very few problems affecting the roster. Only one <a href="American%20football%20positions%23Defense">defensive</a> <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23S">starter</a> missed a game due to injury. On <a href="Offensive%20line">offense</a>, starting running back Selvin Young injured his ankle in the game against Louisiana-Lafayette and re-injured it the following week against Ohio State. He did not play in the games against Rice or Baylor. Receiver Jordan Shipley missed the entire season due to a pulled <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a>.

The <a href="Austin%20Police%20Department">Austin Police Department</a> charged UT receiver Myron Hardy with a Class A <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> for carrying a prohibited weapon, a "'butterfly style knife' that operates like a <a href="switchblade">switchblade</a>, making it a prohibited weapon." Hardy appeared in four games for the <a href="2004%20Texas%20Longhorn%20football%20team">2004 team</a>, catching one pass for four yards. He redshirted in 2005 and returned to the roster for 2006.

The police investigated assault allegations against Cedric Griffin and Ramonce Taylor but no charges were filed. The incident allegedly occurred December 10, 2005, near the <a href="Sixth%20Street%20%28Austin%29">Sixth Street</a> entertainment district. The UT athletics department found no reason to discipline the players and they both played in the final game of the season. Also in December, the police announced they were investigating a Longhorn player in a separate incident that occurred in September. This incident allegedly involved <a href="armed%20robbery">armed robbery</a> with a <a href="handgun">handgun</a>. The police did not name the target of the investigation.

Three Longhorns, freshman running backs Michael Houston and Jerrell Wilkerson and sophomore defensive back Bobby Tatum, elected to transfer prior to UT's <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a>. All three were reserve players.

This game marked the second meeting of the Texas Longhorns and the <a href="University%20of%20Louisiana%20at%20Lafayette">Louisiana Lafayette</a> <a href="Louisiana%E2%80%93Lafayette%20Ragin%27%20Cajuns%20football">Ragin' Cajuns</a>. In their first meeting in 2000, UT fell behind 10–0 before quarterback <a href="Major%20Applewhite">Major Applewhite</a> entered the game late in the first <a href="Quarterback%20controversy">quarter</a> and threw for 315 yards and 4 touchdowns as the Longhorns scored 52 unanswered points in a 52–10 victory.

Prior to <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> of the 2005 game, the stadium announcer made an appeal for donations to help those suffering in the aftermath of <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which devastated parts of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> five days previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during <a href="2003%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq">missions in southeastern Iraq</a>. For this game only, the Longhorns wore <a href="throwback%20uniform">throwback uniform</a>s furnished by <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963 National Championship season under Coach <a href="Darrell%20Royal">Darrell K. Royal</a>. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90 °F (32 °C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.

Texas scored first when <a href="Selvin%20Young">Selvin Young</a> ran the ball in for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. The <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> attempt by <a href="Richmond%20McGee">Richmond McGee</a> was <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29%23Missed%20and%20blocked%20field%20goals">no good</a>. The Cajuns were able to score three points on a <a href="field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> by Sean Comiskey making the score Texas 6, Louisiana Lafayette 3. Texas replied with 54 unanswered points to win the game 60–3. With the win, Texas improved its record in season-opening games to 93–17–3 and 72–2–2 when they open the year at home. That figure includes 11 straight wins and victories in 30 of their last 31 games at home. Their home record under Mack Brown improved to 39 wins and 3 losses.

Several new Longhorn players entered the game. <a href="Time%20of%20possession">True freshman</a> running back <a href="Jamaal%20Charles">Jamaal Charles</a> set the UT <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> record for a debut game with 135 yards and a rushing touchdown alongside one <a href="Reception%20%28American%20football%29">reception</a> for 18 yards, after taking over during the game for injured running back <a href="Selvin%20Young">Selvin Young</a>. True freshman running back <a href="Henry%20Melton">Henry Melton</a> also saw his first action and scored his first touchdown at the college level. True freshman Quan Cosby got his first college start, and two other true freshmen (Roy Miller and Aaron Lewis) saw action.

 
According to "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", the match-up between the Longhorns and the <a href="2005%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team">Ohio State Buckeyes</a> (OSU) was one of the most-anticipated games of the 2005 season. Teams have become increasingly conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> <a href="College%20GameDay%20%28football%29">College GameDay</a> chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The <a href="American%20Football%20Coaches%20Association">American Football Coaches Association</a> brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near <a href="Bevo%20%28mascot%29">Bevo</a>, the UT <a href="mascot">mascot</a> (photo below).

Texas and Ohio State are two of the oldest and "most storied" programs in college football, but this game was the first meeting between the two teams. For Texas, it meant playing a second <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a> "powerhouse" less than one year after winning the first meeting between Texas and the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> at the end of the <a href="2004%20Texas%20Longhorns%20football%20team">2004 season</a>.

The game was played in <a href="Ohio%20Stadium">Ohio Stadium</a>, also known as "The Horseshoe" or "the Shoe". This stadium is notoriously tough for visiting teams, as its large capacity and structural design focus a tremendous amount of crowd noise that can make it difficult for the visiting team to call <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23A">audibles</a> at the <a href="line%20of%20scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a>.

Texas scored first with a 42-yard field goal, which was a career-long for Longhorn kicker David Pino. A five-yard touchdown pass from Vince Young to Billy Pittman gave the Longhorns a 10–0 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Buckeyes controlled most of the second quarter. Their first score was a 45 yd field goal by <a href="Josh%20Huston">Josh Huston</a> followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to <a href="Santonio%20Holmes">Santonio Holmes</a> to tie the score at 10–10. They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston. Texas made a field goal to trim Ohio State's lead to 16–13 at the half. In the third quarter, Texas made one field goal and OSU made two, extending Ohio State's lead to 22–16. In the fourth quarter, Texas regained the lead with a touchdown pass from Young to Limas Sweed. UT's <a href="Aaron%20Harris%20%28American%20football%29">Aaron Harris</a> <a href="Quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> OSU's <a href="Troy%20Smith">Troy Smith</a> for a <a href="safety%20%28American%20football%20score%29">safety</a> and Texas took a three-point lead, which they held when time expired.

Texas' win, by a score of 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would experience all season, both in terms of points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked <a href="Auburn%20Tigers%20football">Auburn</a>. Texas became the first non-conference opponent to beat the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an end to a 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first team to beat the Buckeyes in a night game at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10th straight victory in a night-game road contest. <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> and "College Football Rivals" each named the game one of the best football games of the season.

The <a href="Rice%20Owls">Rice Owls</a> and Texas met in 2005 for the 88th time. Texas held a 65–21–1 lead in the series, which began in 1914. For the Longhorns this series ranks fourth in number of games played, behind Texas A&M, Oklahoma, and Baylor. The two schools were once conference foes in the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a> and have maintained a rivalry despite the fact that Texas enjoys a sizable lead in the series. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> alluded to the lopsidedness of the rivalry in his 1962 speech on America's space program: "But why, some say, the moon? ... And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? ... We choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." In addition to continuing a traditional rivalry, playing Rice in a <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23H">home and away</a> series allows for Texas to play games in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas, an important recruiting base for UT, which has a significant <a href="Texas%20Exes">Texas Exes</a> alumni population.

The Horns took <a href="Pancake%20blocks">possession</a> of the ball to start the game and used less than two minutes in scoring on a 25-yard carry by Jamaal Charles. Rice advanced to the Texas 43-yard line before punting the ball to Texas' one-yard line, forcing the Longhorns to start from inside their own <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>. UT drove the ball 99 yards in seven plays for a second touchdown. With four seconds left in the first quarter, Vince Young threw a pass that was <a href="intercepted">intercepted</a> by Ja'Corey Shepherd at the UT 20-yard line. Rice lost yardage on their possession and failed to <a href="Fourth%20down">convert on fourth down</a> so they <a href="Time%20of%20possession">turned the ball over on downs</a>. The rest of the first-half scoring was dominated by the Longhorns as they scored four more touchdowns to take a 42–0 lead. The Owls had four–more possessions in the second–quarter but never advanced the ball past their own 30-yard line.

In the second half, each team scored one field goal and one touchdown, although Texas missed their <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> so they won the game 51–10. UT's <a href="Jamaal%20Charles">Jamaal Charles</a> ran for 189 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries in his first start for the Longhorns. After the game, Charles said that his goal was to rush for 200 yards each game but that he was not disappointed to fall short of 200 yards rushing because he hit his goal of rushing for three touchdowns.

Sportscasters touted the contest with the <a href="Missouri%20Tigers">Missouri Tigers</a> as a showcase between of the two best <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23D">dual-threat quarterbacks</a> playing in college football, pitting Missouri quarterback <a href="Brad%20Smith%20%28American%20football%29">Brad Smith</a> against Vince Young of Texas. The two players combined for 582 yards total offense. Both Young and Smith led their respective team in rushing yards. Young had 108 rushing yards while Smith had 57. Young had 236 passing yards compared to Smith's 181.

The Longhorns and the Tigers each scored two touchdowns in the first quarter, though Missouri missed an extra point to let Texas take a 14–13 lead. Texas scored another touchdown and a field goal to make a 24–13 lead at halftime. In the second half, Texas scored four more touchdowns, missing one extra point to increase their lead to 51–13. Missouri was scoreless for 40 minutes of play until they scored a touchdown with 3:54 left to play; it was their only score of the second half. Texas won the game 51–20 to extend its series lead over Missouri to 15–5.

 
 

Football fans consider the annual game between Texas and the <a href="Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football">Oklahoma Sooners</a> (OU) one of the greatest rivalries games in all of college sports. Though officially called the Red River Rivalry, it remains better known by its traditional name, the <a href="Red%20River%20Shootout">Red River Shootout</a>; the <a href="2005%20Oklahoma%20vs.%20Texas%20football%20game">2005 match-up</a> was the 100th in the series.

Since 1912 the teams have played the game at the <a href="Cotton%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29">Cotton Bowl</a> stadium in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, amid the atmosphere of the adjacent <a href="Texas%20State%20Fair">Texas State Fair</a>. This is unusual because most college football games alternate between the opponents home stadiums. Dallas was chosen as the neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools. The stadium is divided down the 50-yard line, with half of the stadium predominantly clad in the crimson and cream colors of Oklahoma, and the other half mostly wearing the <a href="burnt%20orange">burnt orange</a> and white of Texas.

The game frequently has implications for the conference and national championship races. Since 1945, at least one of the teams was ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Prior to the 2005 game, Texas held an advantage in the all-time series 55–39–5, which included a 43–35–4 edge in Dallas, but Oklahoma had won the 5 previous games, including the two worst losses ever for a Texas team in the series. Those losses had helped build a reputation that Mack Brown was not capable of winning in "Big Games". Four times during those five years, Texas' loss to Oklahoma prevented them from playing in the Big 12 Conference Championship Game. One of these two teams appeared in four of the nine BCS national championship games from 1999 to 2007.

The Longhorns scored first with a touchdown pass from Vince Young to Ramonce Taylor; this was the first time for Texas to lead Oklahoma since 2002 and Texas' first passing touchdown against Oklahoma since 2000. The Sooners' Garrett Hartley answered with a 52-yard field goal, the longest of his college career, and a 9-yard field goal. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored next on an 80-yard touchdown run. UT then scored with a 38-yard field goal by Richmond McGee and a 64-yard long bomb from Young to Billy Pittman just before halftime, giving Texas a 24–6 lead at the half. UT made the only score of the third quarter: a 27-yard touchdown pass from Young to Pittman. In the fourth quarter UT scored two touchdowns while OU scored one.

UT was favored by 14 points and won the game by 33 points, tying the biggest margin of victory for the Longhorns in the history of the rivalry, a 40–7 victory in 1941. The game also marked the sixth time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked second nationally; they have won all six. With the win, Texas started their season 5–0 for the first time since 1983.

Of all the teams on Texas regular season schedule, <a href="Colorado%20Buffaloes%20football">Colorado</a> had the best historical record against Texas up to the start of the season. The all-time record was tied at 7–7, and the record since the formation of the Big 12 conference was tied at 3–3. Texas established a lead early in the game and never lost it; they led 35–10 at halftime and defeated the <a href="2005%20Colorado%20Buffaloes%20football%20team">2005 Colorado team</a> by a final score of 42–17.

Texas scored touchdowns on all five of their first half possessions; these included three rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, one rushing touchdown by Selvin Young, and one touchdown pass from Vince Young to Limas Sweed. Colorado was scoreless in the first quarter. In the second quarter they scored with a 48-yard field goal by <a href="Mason%20Crosby">Mason Crosby</a> and a touchdown pass from <a href="Joel%20Klatt">Joel Klatt</a> to Evan Judge. After neither team scored in the third quarter, each team completed one touchdown pass in the final period.

Vince Young had the best statistical performance of his career to date, completing 25 of 29 passing attempts for 336 yards and two passing touchdowns in addition to 58 yards rushing and 3 rushing touchdowns. His 86.2% completion percentage set a new single-game record for UT, breaking his previous record of 85.7% set against Oklahoma State in 2004. After the game, Colorado Head Coach <a href="Gary%20Barnett">Gary Barnett</a> said of Young's passing performance, "We can't do that in practice against air." meaning that his team would not have been able to complete 86.2% of their passes even if playing unopposed.

The <a href="Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders">Texas Tech Red Raiders</a> came into the game undefeated and ranked number 10 in the nation with hopes of beating Texas, winning out the season, and playing for a national championship.

The Longhorns scored a field goal on their first possession and Texas Tech answered with a touchdown pass by <a href="Cody%20Hodges">Cody Hodges</a>. Texas regained the lead when Henry Melton rushed for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Red Raiders tied up the game with a field goal before Texas regained the lead with two touchdown runs by Selvin Young and a touchdown pass to Billy Pittman. In the third quarter, the Longhorns extended their lead with two touchdowns to one by Texas Tech. Texas' seventh touchdown came with 6:30 left in the game and it was the last points scored in the game.

Texas won the game 52–17 and moved into first place in the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) standings for the first time since they were implemented in 1998. The BCS formula took into account <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series%232004-05%20formula">strength of schedule</a> so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, who previously held the number one spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.

The week following the Texas Tech game Vince Young said he still planned to return for his senior season in 2006. Young, a candidate for the <a href="Heisman%20trophy">Heisman trophy</a>, also apologized for striking the "Heisman pose" during the win over Texas Tech; this had been viewed as an immodest indiscretion.

Texas place at the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas initially trailed but rallied to beat an <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys">Oklahoma State Cowboys</a> team that had held a losing record through the season so far. Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough to stay ahead of USC in the overall BCS standings.

Oklahoma State scored first, with a surprising 49 yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 as if trying a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 at the end of the first quarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the second quarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The second half was dominated by Texas as they scored five unanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of two rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, two rushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21-yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.

Despite Oklahoma State's 0–4 start to conference play, they led Texas the entire first half, including a lead of as much as nineteen points. It was the third straight year that Texas trailed Oklahoma State at halftime and came from behind to win by a sizable margin (47–28). Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506 yards (239 passing, 267 rushing). Young also became one of only seven players in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing in a single game. Over the past three meetings between the two schools (2003–2005), the Longhorns outscored the Cowboys by a combined second-half score of 118–0.

<a href="TBS%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">TBS</a> announced that the Longhorns' come-from-behind victory scored a record <a href="Audience%20measurement">viewership</a> rating of 1.927 million viewers. This represented a 21 percent increase over the previous TBS network record for <a href="USC%20Trojans%20football">Southern California</a> vs. <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal">Stanford</a> in 2004.

The Longhorns first played the <a href="Baylor%20Bears">Baylor Bears</a> in 1901 and have faced them annually since both were members of the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a>. In the 95 meetings through 2005, Texas' record was 69 wins, 22 losses, and 4 ties. Only Texas A&M and the University of Oklahoma had faced Texas more often on the football field.

Texas was stopped on their first drive due to an unsuccessful <a href="fourth%20down%20conversion">fourth down conversion</a>. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's <a href="Michael%20Huff">Michael Huff</a> intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended the lead in the second quarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the third quarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourth touchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005 game 62–0 making it the only <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> of the 2005 season for the Longhorns.

The 2005 Baylor game was played in <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco, Texas</a>, approximately 100 miles (161 km) north on <a href="Interstate%2035">Interstate 35</a> from Austin. Since UT home games are usually sold out and Waco is relatively close to Austin, recent games against Baylor have attracted numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to see the game. The Baylor athletic department suspended ticket sales at one point in an effort to limit the number of Longhorn fans who purchased tickets. The average attendance for Baylor's home games for the season was 38,899, but for the UT game the attendance was 44,783 still short of the 50,000 official capacity for Baylor's <a href="Floyd%20Casey%20Stadium">Floyd Casey Stadium</a>.

In order to win the 2004 game against the <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football">Kansas Jayhawks</a>, Texas had to convert a 4th-and-18 situation and complete a touchdown pass with only eleven seconds remaining on the clock. The 2005 game provided much less on-field drama, as Texas led 52–0 by halftime and defeated Kansas 66–14.

In the first quarter, Texas scored touchdowns on a pass to Limas Sweed, a run by Jamaal Charles, a pass to Quan Cosby, and a <a href="Pancake%20block">punt return</a> by Aaron Ross. In the second quarter, the Longhorns had a touchdown run by Ramonce Taylor and touchdown catches from David Thomas and Peter Ullman. David Pino also kicked a field goal for the Horns. In the third quarter, Kansas opened the scoring with a 59-yard touchdown by <a href="Jon%20Cornish">Jon Cornish</a>. Taylor scored another touchdown. UT had the only score of the fourth quarter, a touchdown by Selvin Young.

UT fans were unhappy with <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>'s television coverage of the event. The network elected to stick with the Oklahoma vs. Texas A&M game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A&M game through the final down and then ran three full minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14–0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying "And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which has pretty much already been decided." ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without coverage for much of the game.

The lopsided victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren entered the game in the third quarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the midpoint of the fourth quarter. Since <a href="Colt%20McCoy">Colt McCoy</a> was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005 season, choosing to <a href="redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, <a href="Jevan%20Snead">Jevan Snead</a> – ranked as one of the top high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> to Texas.

This game marked the 112th meeting between Texas and the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Aggies%20football">Texas A&M Aggies</a> and the game is part of a multi-sport rivalry called the <a href="Lone%20Star%20Showdown">Lone Star Showdown</a>. It is the longest-running rivalry for both the Longhorns and the Aggies and the football series is the third most-played rivalries in college football. Texas came into the 2005 contest with a 72–34–5 record. During the week before the game, the Longhorns conducted their traditional <a href="Hex%20Rally">Hex Rally</a>. As a result of a tragic accident in 1999, the Aggies did not host a school-sponsored version of their traditional <a href="Aggie%20Bonfire">Bonfire</a> but an unofficial version called "Student Bonfire" was held November 19, 2005 despite a county-wide ban on bonfires. The game's attendance was 86,616, which is 4,016 more than the official stadium capacity for Kyle Field.

Like the contest against Missouri, sportswriters touted the Texas A&M game as showcasing two of the best dual-threat quarterbacks playing in college football. However, Texas A&M's starting quarterback <a href="Reggie%20McNeal">Reggie McNeal</a> missed the game due to an ankle injury; instead, freshman quarterback <a href="Stephen%20McGee">Stephen McGee</a> made his first start. The game was a back-and-forth affair ultimately won by Texas, 40–29. The eleven point win was their second slimmest margin of victory of the regular season to that point, and they lost points in all three major polls but still remained solidly in second place.

The game was the poorest performance of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162 yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, considered one of the nations best quarterbacks and a <a href="Heisman%20trophy">Heisman trophy</a> candidate coming into the game, was "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Texan">The Daily Texan</a>" predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach <a href="Mack%20Brown">Mack Brown</a> as saying "Looking at the numbers from what <a href="Reggie%20Bush">Reggie Bush</a> did last week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens."

UT running backs Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor also received criticism. Taylor was criticized for running backwards and sideways in an effort to gain yards, instead of moving ahead and breaking tackles. "The Daily Texan" observed "Five of Taylor's 15 carries resulted in a loss or no gain for a total of minus-17 yards. However, the other 10 carries totaled 119 yards for an average of 11.9 yards per positive running play. The sophomore didn't have a positive gain of fewer than 5 yards and accumulated three runs of 20 yards or longer." <a href="Greg%20Davis%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Greg Davis</a>, UT's offensive coordinator, said "Ramonce is a darter. The only time that really concerned me was a third-and-two situation. We talked to him on the sideline about a little bit more down and distance awareness." Melton was criticized for "tiptoeing indecisively". and letting himself get tackled near the <a href="line%20of%20scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a>.

On defense, the Longhorns held A&M to only 118 yards passing but gave up 277 yards rushing; the highest allowed by the Longhorns all season. Despite the poor outing, Texas finished the regular season undefeated. <a href="Gene%20Chizik">Gene Chizik</a>, UT's <a href="defensive%20coordinator">defensive coordinator</a>, said "This really is an eye-opening experience. Obviously, we've got to get better. But I'll tell you what, we're all going to drive home 11–0."

The <a href="Big%2012%20Football%20Championship%20Game">Big 12 Championship Game</a> is held by the Big 12 Conference each year. The championship game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. Despite losing the last two games of the regular season, Colorado retained the best record in the North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Prior to the game, Colorado head coach <a href="Gary%20Barnett">Gary Barnett</a> said, "I do not think anybody expects us to come in here and beat Texas." His team lost the game 70–3, the most lopsided score in any college football conference championship to date.

The Longhorns scored ten touchdowns in their first eleven possessions. They started with first-quarter touchdowns by Henry Melton and Jamaal Charles. The Buffaloes got their only score of the game, a field goal, at the start of the second quarter. Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the second quarter to give the Horns a 42–3 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored rushing touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on defense due to <a href="Michael%20Griffin%20%28football%20player%29">Michael Griffin</a> blocking a Colorado punt. Halfway through the third quarter, Texas already had 70 points, but went on cruise control from that point on and did not score again.

Following the victory, the largely UT crowd stayed in the stands to celebrate the Longhorns' return to the Rose Bowl—this time for a shot at a National Championship. As players circled the stadium giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a section of the railing collapsed and fans spilled onto the sideline. One person suffered injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher.

Texas earned its second Big 12 football championship to make 27 conference championships total, including 25 in the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a>. The week after the game, Barnett was fired as Colorado's head coach and replaced by <a href="Dan%20Hawkins%20%28coach%29">Dan Hawkins</a>, the former head coach of <a href="Boise%20State%20University">Boise State</a>.

For the 2005 season, the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Rose Bowl</a> also served as the <a href="BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">BCS National Championship Game</a> as a result of the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> agreement. In the weeks leading up to the <a href="2006%20Rose%20Bowl">2006 Rose Bowl</a>, the game was described by numerous publications as one of the most-anticipated match-ups in college football history and even as the greatest college football game of all time. This was Texas' second trip to the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20Game">Rose Bowl</a> in school history, alongside their trip the previous season.

Less than three weeks before the game, <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California%20Trojans%20football">USC Trojan</a> <a href="Reggie%20Bush">Reggie Bush</a> won the <a href="Heisman%20trophy">Heisman trophy</a>—since <a href="Heisman%20Trophy%23vacation">vacated</a>—ahead of second place finisher Vince Young. Bush had the second highest number of first place votes in Heisman history (behind <a href="O.J.%20Simpson">O.J. Simpson</a>) and the highest percentage of first place votes, while Young had a record number of second place votes. Bush's 933-point margin of victory was the 17th highest in the history of the Heisman voting. The third finalist was USC's <a href="Matt%20Leinart">Matt Leinart</a>, who won the Heisman trophy in 2004. This Rose Bowl would mark the first time two Heisman trophy winners would ever play in the same backfield.

The game's outcome was in doubt until the final minute of play. With 19 seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a touchdown and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the ball into the end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.

Young completed 30 of 40 passes for 267 yards and carried the ball 19 times for 200 yards and 3 rushing touchdowns. His 467 total yards set a new Rose Bowl and BCS Championship Game record. He won the Rose Bowl "Most Valuable Player" (MVP) award for the second consecutive year, joining <a href="Ron%20Dayne">Ron Dayne</a>, <a href="Bob%20Schloredt">Bob Schloredt</a>, and <a href="Charles%20White%20%28American%20football%29">Charles White</a> as the only two-time winners but the only player from outside the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten</a> or <a href="Pac-10">Pac-10</a>. <a href="David%20Thomas%20%28American%20football%29">David Thomas</a>' ten receptions set a UT record for most receptions in a game by a <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a>.
Prior to the game, commentators had postulated that the <a href="2005%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team">2005 USC team</a> was one of or even "the" "greatest team of all-time". ESPN analysts were virtually unanimous in their declaration of the 2005 USC Trojans as the best offense in the history of college football, despite the fact that they were in second place behind Texas in terms of points scored during the season. ESPN analysts <a href="Mark%20May">Mark May</a> and <a href="Kirk%20Herbstreit">Kirk Herbstreit</a> declared, before the 2005 Rose Bowl had even been played, that the 2005 USC Trojans were the second best college football team of the past 50 years. May placed them behind only the <a href="1995%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team">1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers</a>; Herbstreit behind only the <a href="2001%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">2001 Miami Hurricanes</a>. This led to Texas fans at the Rose Bowl mockingly chanting "Best ... Team ... Ever" during the post-game celebration. Stewart Mandell of "Sports Illustrated" observed, "ESPN spent the better part of Christmas season comparing that Trojans squad to some of the most acclaimed teams of all time only to find out that they weren't even the best team that season."

Texas' Rose Bowl win was the 800th victory in school history and it earned the Longhorns their fourth consensus national championship in football. Since the game, the media, coaches, and other commentators have heaped praise upon the Texas team, Young, and the Rose Bowl performance. Both the Rose Bowl win as well as the Longhorns' overall season have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by observers such as "<a href="College%20Football%20News">College Football News</a>", the "<a href="Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>", "Scout.com", "<a href="Austin%20American-Statesman">Austin American-Statesman</a>", and "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>". ESPN awarded the two teams the 2006 <a href="ESPY%20Award">ESPY Award</a> for the "Best Game" in any sport.
Texas' win over USC was their ninth consecutive victory when facing a ranked opponent. Texas broke USC's winning streak (then the longest in the nation) at 34 and claimed the longest running winning streak for themselves at 20 wins in a row. Texas' 20-game winning streak was the second-longest winning streak in school history; Texas had 30 wins in a row from 1968 to 1970. Texas extended the winning streak to 21 before a September 9, 2006, loss to <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>. In beating USC, Texas defeated a No. 1 ranked team for the first time since defeating Alabama in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1965. The Longhorns ended the season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage (.7143).

The pre-season editions of the <a href="Associated%20Press%20Poll">Associated Press Poll</a> and "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" <a href="Coaches%20Poll">Coaches Poll</a> pre-season polls both ranked Texas number two in the nation behind defending National Champion <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. The two teams maintained those rankings throughout the entire 2005 regular season. Texas was ranked second in each week of the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">BCS rankings</a>, except for one week where Texas took the top spot with USC falling to number two. The BCS rankings during 2005 were based on a formula which factored in the votes of two human polls (the USA Today coach's poll and the Harris Interactive poll), combined with a variety of computer rankings. The computer rankings favored Texas as the No. 1 team throughout the entire season, due partly to Texas's wins over ranked programs such as <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> and <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Tech University</a>.

On October 24, 2005, Texas passed USC in the BCS rankings due to a strong showing in the computer rankings, which favored the Longhorns because of the overall strength of their opponents as well as the October 22, 2005, win over previously unbeaten Texas Tech. The first-place ranking was the first for UT in the BCS era, and the first top ranking in any major football poll since October 8, 1984, when they were atop both the Associated Press and Coaches polls. The 0.0007% margin separating Texas from USC was the slimmest margin between the top two teams since the inception of BCS rankings.

The stay at the top was short-lived. With the October 31, 2005, BCS rankings, Texas remained first in the computer rankings, with <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football">Virginia Tech</a> pulling even with USC for number two in the computer rankings. However, USC remained atop both human polls and was able to reclaim the top overall ranking. Texas and USC won the rest of their games and faced each other in the National Championship, which Texas won 41–38. This was only the 35th meeting of the two top-ranked teams in the history of college football, including both regular season and bowl games. The BCS system now ensures that the two top teams in the BCS rankings face each other annually in a national championship game, but the methodology for ranking the teams remains controversial among fans and sportswriters.

The 2005 season marks only the eighth time in 50 years that exactly two teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated. This has been a major criticism of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top two teams can generate controversy. If more than two undefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.

In the eight National Championship games through the 2006 Rose Bowl, the team ranked number one prior to the game has won five times, while the number two team has won three times. Up to the 2007 season, no school had won the BCS championship twice. In the final polls after the bowl games, Texas received all 62 first place votes in the Coaches Poll and all 65 first place votes in the AP Poll.

Analysts labeled the team, their season, and their championship victory as the greatest or among the greatest in the history of the sport. <a href="College%20Football%20News">College Football News</a> judged the 2005 Longhorns to have played the greatest college football season ever. Sports-writers at College Football News also consider the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29">2006 Rose Bowl</a> to be the best college football game ever played. <a href="Furman%20Bisher">Furman Bisher</a> of the <a href="Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> said "if there ever has been a greater game, I never saw it, and I've been watching college football games since 1934." "Scout.com" called it "one of the best national title games ever", while Kevin Hench of Fox Sports called it "perhaps the greatest college football game ever played." <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> declared the 2006 Rose Bowl Game an <a href="ESPN%20Classic">instant classic</a> and re-aired it within a week of the original broadcast. ESPN later awarded the 2006 <a href="ESPY%20Award">ESPY Award</a> to the Longhorns and Trojans for the 2006 "Best Game" in any sport. Vince Young and Matt Leinart accepted the award on behalf of their teams. ESPN columnist Mark Schlabach ranked the 2005 Texas Longhorns as fourth-best among the first ten BCS-era champions.

The championship game drew attention from political figures. Head Coach Mack Brown took a congratulatory call from United States President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, who told Brown, "Congratulations on a wonderful moment ... Tell the team congratulations, we're proud of them." <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Secretary">White House Press Secretary</a> <a href="Scott%20McClellan">Scott McClellan</a> said Bush wished Brown and the Longhorns all the best, and said that he looked forward to having them visit the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> soon. Bush was formerly a <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Texas">Governor of Texas</a> and his daughter Jenna is a UT graduate. On February 14, 2006, Bush did host the team and coaches at the White House. <a href="Governor%20of%20California">California Governor</a> <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> lost a bet with <a href="Texas%20Governor">Texas Governor</a> <a href="Rick%20Perry">Rick Perry</a> on the outcome and had to send Perry a basket of "California wines, fruit and other goodies". The food was donated to <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> troops in Texas. Both governors also offered autographed, handmade cowboy boots that were auctioned to benefit survivors of <a href="Hurricane%20Rita">Hurricane Rita</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Los Angeles Mayor <a href="Antonio%20Villaraigosa">Antonio Villaraigosa</a> lost a bet with <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a> Mayor <a href="Will%20Wynn">Will Wynn</a> and had to send a basket of produce, such as avocados, from a local farmers' market; Wynn had bet Texas' finest barbecue.

Seconds after Texas beat Southern California 41–38, the university lit the UT tower orange, the traditional signal of victory on the campus. Since this was a national championship, office lights were also left selectively lit in order to form a number "1" on all four sides of the tower (pictured). Texas students and fans spilled onto the streets of Austin and made their way to campus for an impromptu celebration. Though police were out in force, there were no reports of problems. The school commissioned a painting titled "<a href="The%20University%20of%20Texas%20National%20Championship%202005">The University of Texas National Championship 2005</a>" by <a href="Opie%20Otterstad">Opie Otterstad</a> to commemorate the win in the Rose Bowl and the National Championship.

Special editions of magazines and products featured the team. "<a href="Dave%20Campbell%27s%20Texas%20Football">Dave Campbell's Texas Football</a>" put out a 45,000-copy special issue titled "One for the Ages – Vince Young Leads Longhorns to the Fourth National Title". This issue included a column from Longhorn fan <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> as well as 15 pages of photos from the Rose Bowl. The cover featured Young kissing the "crystal football" national championship trophy. "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" held up their regular weekly edition to await the results of the Rose Bowl. They finally went to press with a cover showing Young diving into the end zone with the label "<a href="Superman">Superman</a>". Analysis inside the issue gave Young a large part of the credit for the win. They also printed a special commemorative issue in the state of Texas with Young on the cover, shouting in triumph amidst a storm of multi-colored <a href="confetti">confetti</a> after winning the game. Features in the special edition included a story on "Vince Young's Glory Days" by Tim Layden, as well as a story dissecting "How the" Rose Bowl "was won" by Austin Murphy. The issue was on sale alongside the regular edition of the magazine. <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a> produced a commemorative issue <a href="Wheaties">Wheaties</a> box featuring Mack Brown and a Texas Longhorns football helmet on the front. The commemorative packaging was sold nationwide. Texas is the first national college football champion to be featured since Nebraska was on the box in 1997.

Individual players and coaches also received honors. "Vince Young Day" was proclaimed by Mayor <a href="Bill%20White%20%28Texas%20politician%29">Bill White</a> in <a href="Houston">Houston</a> on January 10, 2006, to honor the Houston native. White said that Young is "an inspiration to all Houstonians, both young and old." On January 15, 2006, 51,244 Texas fans gathered in <a href="Darrell%20K.%20Royal%20%E2%80%93%20Texas%20Memorial%20Stadium">Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium</a> to celebrate the team and their victorious season. Mack Brown was named the <a href="Paul%20%26quot%3BBear%26quot%3B%20Bryant%20Award">Paul "Bear" Bryant College Football Coach of the Year</a>, as voted on by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. Brown became the first winner of the award from UT since <a href="Darrell%20Royal">Darrell Royal</a> in 1963. The championship season lifted the reputation of Mack Brown and the offensive coordinator, <a href="Greg%20Davis%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Greg Davis</a>. Davis was consistently criticized for over-conservative play-calling. After the championship win the criticism quieted down, but did not go away completely. As of 2007 sportswriters continue to debate whether Vince Young and the other talented UT players succeeded despite Davis or because of him.

Despite previous statements that he would return for his senior season, redshirt junior quarterback Vince Young announced that he would forgo his final year of NCAA eligibility and made himself eligible for the 2006 <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> draft. The <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> chose him as the third overall <a href="draft%20pick">draft pick</a>. Besides Young, five other Longhorns from this championship team joined professional teams through the <a href="2006%20NFL%20Draft">2006 NFL Draft</a> – <a href="Michael%20Huff">Michael Huff</a> (number 7 overall), <a href="Cedric%20Griffin">Cedric Griffin</a> (number 48 overall), <a href="David%20Thomas%20%28American%20football%29">David Thomas</a> (number 86 overall), <a href="Jonathan%20Scott%20%28American%20football%29">Jonathan Scott</a> (number 141 overall) and <a href="Rodrique%20Wright">Rodrique Wright</a> (number 222 overall). As a result, fullback <a href="Ahmard%20Hall">Ahmard Hall</a> was re-united with his former teammate Vince Young in the NFL, playing for Tennessee. One year later, seven more members of this team were selected in the <a href="2007%20NFL%20Draft">2007 NFL Draft</a> – <a href="Michael%20Griffin%20%28American%20football%29">Michael Griffin</a> (number 19 overall), <a href="Aaron%20Ross%20%28American%20football%29">Aaron Ross</a> (number 20 overall), <a href="Justin%20Blalock">Justin Blalock</a> (number 39 overall), <a href="Tim%20Crowder%20%28American%20football%29">Tim Crowder</a> (number 56 overall), <a href="Brian%20Robison">Brian Robison</a> (number 102 overall), <a href="Tarell%20Brown">Tarell Brown</a> (number 147 overall), <a href="Kasey%20Studdard">Kasey Studdard</a> (number 183 overall). <a href="Lyle%20Sendlein">Lyle Sendlein</a> and <a href="Selvin%20Young">Selvin Young</a> were not drafted but signed with NFL teams as free agents. In the <a href="2008%20NFL%20Draft">2008 NFL Draft</a>, five more Longhorns from this team were selected: Limas Sweed (number 53rd overall), Jamaal Charles (number 73 overall), Jermichael Finley (number 91 overall), <a href="Tony%20Hills%20%28American%20football%29">Tony Hills</a> (number 130 overall), and <a href="Frank%20Okam">Frank Okam</a> (number 151 overall). In addition, <a href="Brandon%20Foster">Brandon Foster</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Griffin">Marcus Griffin</a>, <a href="Nate%20Jones%20%28American%20football%29">Nate Jones</a> and <a href="Derek%20Lokey">Derek Lokey</a> agreed to sign free-agent contracts with NFL teams.

For the <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> which ended in August 2005, just as the 2005 football season was starting, Texas was the nation's richest and most profitable football program, with revenue of , and a profit of . Following the national championship, for the 2005–2006 fiscal year, UT also led the nation in royalties from merchandise sales, setting a new national record at . These royalties went to the University as a whole, not specifically to the athletics programs. The team topped the merchandise rankings again for the 2006–2007 fiscal year.

The official website of UT football posted a special logo (pictured) proclaiming the Longhorns as the national champions. The logo featured the script "National Champions" centered prominently in the center, with "MACKBROWN-TEXASFOOTBALL.COM" in the lower left and "THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LONGHORNS" in the lower right. In the background was an image of a rose, with a small Longhorn symbol appearing in front of the rose and between the two sections of the smaller print. In the upper right-hand side, the years "1963, 1969, 1970, 2005" appear, with the "2005" given special emphasis. These years correspond to the four consensus national championships won by the UT football team. The special logo was removed from the website's home page after a few months, but as of 2007 it is still found on certain portions of the site related to the 2005 season.
Longhorn players from both the offense and defense set records for their performance during the season or received national recognition and awards.

The team also set school and NCAA records and received accolades.

Phallus indusiatus

Phallus indusiatus, commonly called the bamboo fungus, bamboo pith, long net stinkhorn, crinoline stinkhorn or veiled lady, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Phallaceae">Phallaceae</a>, or stinkhorns. It has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a> in <a href="tropical">tropical</a> areas, and is found in southern Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia, where it grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well-rotted woody material. The <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungus%29">fruit body</a> of the fungus is characterised by a conical to bell-shaped cap on a <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> and a delicate lacy "skirt", or <a href="indusium">indusium</a>, that hangs from beneath the cap and reaches nearly to the ground. First described scientifically in 1798 by French botanist <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Étienne Pierre Ventenat</a>, the species has often been referred to a separate genus "Dictyophora" along with other "Phallus" species featuring an indusium. "P. indusiatus" can be distinguished from other similar species by differences in <a href="range%20%28biology%29">distribution</a>, size, color, and indusium length.

Mature fruit bodies are up to tall with a conical to bell-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> that is wide. The cap is covered with a greenish-brown <a href="gleba">spore-containing slime</a>, which attracts flies and other insects that eat the spores and disperse them. An <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> featured as an ingredient in Chinese "<a href="Chinese%20cuisine">haute cuisine</a>", it is used in <a href="stir%20frying">stir-frys</a> and chicken soups. The mushroom, grown commercially and commonly sold in <a href="Asian%20supermarket">Asian markets</a>, is rich in <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, and <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a>. The mushroom also contains various <a href="biological%20activity">bioactive compounds</a>, and has <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> and <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> properties. "Phallus indusiatus" has a <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a> of use in <a href="Chinese%20medicine">Chinese medicine</a> extending back to the 7th century AD, and features in Nigerian folklore.

"Phallus indusiatus" was initially described by French naturalist <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Étienne Pierre Ventenat</a> in 1798, and <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> under that name by <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1801. One author anonymously gave his impressions of Ventenat's discovery in an 1800 publication:
This beautiful species, which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish it from every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly as far from the left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, "Dictyophora", in 1809 by <a href="Nicaise%20Auguste%20Desvaux">Nicaise Auguste Desvaux</a>; it was then known for many years as "Dictyophora indusiata". <a href="Christian%20Gottfried%20Daniel%20Nees%20von%20Esenbeck">Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck</a> placed the species in "Hymenophallus" in 1817, as "H. indusiatus". Both genera were eventually returned to <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> of "<a href="Phallus%20%28fungus%29">Phallus</a>" and the species is now known again by its original name.

<a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> described the <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "rochesterensis" in 1909, originally as a new species, "Phallus rochesterensis". It was found in <a href="Kew%2C%20Victoria">Kew</a>, Australia. A <a href="form%20%28botany%29">form</a> with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by <a href="Vincenzo%20de%20Cesati">Vincenzo de Cesati</a> in 1879 as "Hymenophallus roseus", and later called "Dictyophora indusiata" f. "rosea" by <a href="Yosio%20Kobayasi">Yosio Kobayasi</a> in 1965; it is synonymous with "<a href="Phallus%20cinnabarinus">Phallus cinnabarinus</a>". A taxon described in 1936 as "Dictyophora lutea" and variously known for years as "Dictyophora indusiata" f. "lutea", "D. indusiata" f. "aurantiaca", or "Phallus indusiatus" f. "citrinus", was formally transferred to "Phallus" in 2008 as a distinct species, "<a href="Phallus%20luteus">Phallus luteus</a>".

The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "indūsǐātus", "wearing an undergarment". The former generic name "Dictyophora" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words <a href="https%3A//archive.is/20121215125021/http%3A//artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl%3Fc.17%3A6%3A14.LSJ"></a> ("diktyon", "net"), and <a href="https%3A//archive.is/20121215062110/http%3A//artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl%3Fc.79%3A3%3A158.LSJ"></a> ("pherō", "to bear"), hence "bearing a net". "Phallus indusiatus" has many <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s based on its appearance, including long net stinkhorn, crinoline stinkhorn, basket stinkhorn, bridal veil fungus, and veiled lady. The <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> name , derived from the word "kinugasa", refers to the wide-brimmed hats that featured a hanging silk veil to hide and protect the wearer's face. A <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> common name that alludes to its typical growth habitat is "bamboo mushroom" ().

Immature fruit bodies of "P. indusiatus" are initially enclosed in an egg-shaped to roughly spherical subterranean structure encased in a <a href="peridium">peridium</a>. The "egg" ranges in color from whitish to <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> to reddish-brown, measures up to in diameter, and usually has a thick <a href="mycelial%20cord">mycelial cord</a> attached at the bottom. As the mushroom matures, the pressure caused by the enlargement of the internal structures cause the peridium to tear and the fruit body rapidly emerges from the "egg". The mature mushroom is up to tall and girded with a net-like structure called the <a href="indusium">indusium</a> (or less technically a "skirt") that hangs down from the conical to bell-shaped cap. The netlike openings of the indusium may be polygonal or round in shape. Well-developed specimens have an indusium that reaches to the <a href="Volva%20%28mycology%29">volva</a> and flares out somewhat before collapsing on the stalk. The cap is wide and its reticulated (pitted and ridged) surface is covered with a layer of greenish-brown and foul-smelling slime, the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, which initially partially obscures the reticulations. The top of the cap has a small hole. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> is long, and thick. The hollow stalk is white, roughly equal in width throughout its length, sometimes curved, and spongy. The ruptured peridium remains as a loose volva at the base of the stalk. Fruit bodies develop during the night, and require 10–15 hours to fully develop after emerging from the peridium. They are short-lived, typically lasting no more than a few days. At that point the slime has usually been removed by insects, leaving the pale off-white, bare cap surface exposed. <a href="Spore">Spore</a>s of "P. indusiatus" are thin-walled, smooth, elliptical or slightly curved, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), and measure 2–3 by 1–1.5 μm.

"<a href="Phallus%20multicolor">Phallus multicolor</a>" is similar in overall appearance, but it has a more brightly coloured cap, stem and indusium, and it is usually smaller. It is found in Australia, Guam, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Zaire, and Tobago as well as Hawaii. The cap of the Indo-Pacific species "<a href="Phallus%20merulinus">P. merulinus</a>" appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale and wrinkled once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of "P. indusiatus" tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba. Also, the indusium of "P. merulinus" is more delicate and shorter than that of "P. indusiatus", and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight. Common in eastern North America and Japan, and widely recorded in Europe, the species "<a href="Phallus%20duplicatus">P. duplicatus</a>" has a smaller indusium that hangs from the bottom of the cap, and sometimes collapses against the stalk.

Found in Asia, Australia, Hawaii, southern Mexico, and Central and South America, "P. cinnabarinus" grows to tall, and has a more offensive odor than "P. indusiatus". It attracts flies from the genus "<a href="Lucilia%20%28fly%29">Lucilia</a>" (family <a href="Calliphoridae">Calliphoridae</a>), rather than the house flies of the genus "<a href="Musca">Musca</a>" that visit "P. indusiatus". "<a href="Phallus%20echinovolvatus">P. echinovolvatus</a>", described from China in 1988, is closely related to "P. indusiatus", but can be distinguished by its volva that has a spiky (<a href="wikt%3Aechinulate">echinulate</a>) surface, and its higher preferred growth temperature of . "P. luteus", originally considered a form of "P. indusiatus", has a yellowish reticulate cap, a yellow indusium, and a pale pink to reddish-purple peridium and rhizomorphs. It is found in Asia and Mexico.

The range of "Phallus indusiatus" is <a href="tropical">tropical</a>, including Africa (Congo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zaire) South America (Brazil Guyana, and Venezuela), Central America (Costa Rica), and Tobago. In North America, its range is restricted to Mexico. Asian localities include Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Southern China, Japan, and Taiwan. It has also been collected in Australia.

Like all "Phallus" species, "P. indusiatus" is <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>—deriving nutrients from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains. The method of reproduction for stinkhorns, including "P. indusiatus", is different from most <a href="agaric">agaric</a> mushrooms, which <a href="ballistospore">forcibly eject</a> their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include <a href="stingless%20bees">stingless bees</a> of the genus "<a href="Trigona">Trigona</a>", and flies of the families <a href="Drosophilidae">Drosophilidae</a> and <a href="Muscidae">Muscidae</a>. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to <a href="germination">germinate</a> elsewhere. Although the function of the indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.

In eastern Asia, "P. indusiatus" is considered a delicacy and an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>. Previously only collected in the wild, where it is not abundant, it was difficult to procure. The mushroom's scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions. In the time of China's <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, the species was collected in <a href="Yunnan%20Province">Yunnan Province</a> and sent to the <a href="Forbidden%20City">Imperial Palaces</a> to satisfy the appetite of <a href="Empress%20Dowager%20Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>, who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi. It was one of the eight featured ingredients of the "Bird's Nest Eight Immortals Soup" served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday. This dish, served by descendants of the <a href="Family%20tree%20of%20Confucius%20in%20the%20main%20line%20of%20descent">Confucius family</a> in celebrations and longevity banquets, contained ingredients that were "all precious food, delicacies from land and sea, fresh, tender, and crisp, appropriately sweet and salty". Another notable use was a state banquet held for American diplomat <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> on his <a href="1972%20Nixon%20visit%20to%20China">visit to China</a> to reestablish <a href="Sino-American%20relations">diplomatic relations</a> in the early 1970s. One source writes of the mushroom: "It has a fine and tender texture, fragrance and is attractive, beautiful in shape, fresh and crispy in taste." The dried fungus, commonly sold in <a href="Asian%20supermarket">Asian markets</a>, is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender. Sometimes used in <a href="stir%20frying">stir-frys</a>, it is traditionally used as a component of rich chicken soups. The rehydrated mushroom can also be stuffed and cooked.

"Phallus indusiatus" has been <a href="Fungiculture">cultivated</a> on a commercial scale in China since 1979. In the <a href="Fujian%20Province">Fujian Province</a> of China—known for a thriving mushroom industry that cultivates 45 species of edible fungi—"P. indusiatus" is produced in the <a href="County%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">counties</a> of <a href="Fuan">Fuan</a>, <a href="Jianou">Jianou</a>, and <a href="Ningde">Ningde</a>. Advances in cultivation have made the fungus cheaper and more widely available; in 1998, about were produced in China. The Hong Kong price for a kilogram of dried mushrooms reached around US $770 in 1982, but had dropped to US $100–200 by 1988. Additional advances led to it dropping further to US $10–20 by 2000. The fungus is grown on agricultural wastes—bamboo-trash sawdust covered with a thin layer of non-sterilised soil. The optimal temperature for the growth of mushroom <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29%23Fungi">spawn</a> and fruit bodies is about , with a <a href="relative%20humidity">relative humidity</a> of 90–95%. Other <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a> that can be used for the cultivation of the fungus include bamboo leaves and small stems, <a href="soybean">soybean</a> pods or stems, corn stems, and <a href="willow">willow</a> leaves.

A nutritional analysis of "P. indusiatus" (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) determined that the egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100 g of fungus, <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>) 33.6 g of crude <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>, 1.66 g of <a href="fat">fat</a>, and 3.98 g of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9 g <a href="dietary%20fibre">dietary fibre</a>, and 88.76% <a href="water%20content">moisture</a>. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of "P. indusiatus" is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, and <a href="iron">iron</a>, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the <a href="dietary%20mineral">mineral</a> composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.

According to ethnomycologist <a href="R.%20Gordon%20Wasson">R. Gordon Wasson</a>, "P. indusiatus" was consumed in Mexican <a href="divination">divinatory</a> ceremonies on account of its suggestive shape. On the other side of the globe, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> natives consider the mushroom sacred. In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name "Akufodewa" by the <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba people</a>. The name is derived from a combination of the <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a> words "ku" ("die"), "fun" ("for"), "ode" ("hunter"), and "wa" ("search"), and refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal. The Yoruba have been reported to have used it as a component of a <a href="Spell%20%28paranormal%29">charm</a> to make hunters less visible in times of danger. In other parts of Nigeria, they have been used in the preparation of harmful charms by ethnic groups such as the <a href="Urhobo%20people">Urhobo</a> and the <a href="Ibibio%20people">Ibibio people</a>. The <a href="Igbo%20people">Igbo people</a> of east-central Nigeria called stinkhorns "éró ḿma", from the <a href="Igbo%20language">Igbo</a> words for "mushroom" and "beauty".

Medicinal properties have been ascribed to "Phallus indusiatus" from the time of the Chinese <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> when it was described in <a href="pharmacopoeia">pharmacopoeia</a>. The fungus was used to treat many <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a>, <a href="stomach%20disease">stomach</a>, and <a href="neurological%20disorder">neural diseases</a>. Southern China's <a href="Miao%20people">Miao people</a> continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, <a href="enteritis">enteritis</a>, <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>, and <a href="feebleness">feebleness</a>, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a>, <a href="leucorrhea">leucorrhea</a>, fever, and <a href="oliguria">oliguria</a> (low urine output), <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a>, cough, <a href="hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</a>, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.

The fruit bodies of the fungus contain <a href="biological%20activity">biologically active</a> <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s. A <a href="beta-glucan">β--glucan</a> called T-5-N and prepared from <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> extracts has been shown to have <a href="anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatory</a> properties. Its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of α-1→3 linked -<a href="Mannose">mannopyranosyl</a> residues, with traces of 1→6 linked -mannopyrosyl residues.

Another chemical of interest found in "P. indusiatus" is <a href="hydroxymethylfurfural">hydroxymethylfurfural</a>, which has attracted attention as a <a href="tyrosinase">tyrosinase</a> inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of <a href="melanogenesis">melanogenesis</a> in mammals, and is responsible for the undesirable <a href="browning%20%28food%20process%29%23Enzymatic%20browning">browning</a> reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. "P. indusiatus" also contains a unique <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a> (an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that cuts <a href="RNA">RNA</a> into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.

Two novel <a href="sesquiterpene">sesquiterpene</a>s, <a href="dictyophorine">dictyophorine</a> A and B, have been identified from the fruit bodies of the fungus. These compounds, based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavours and fragrances), are the first eudesmane <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> isolated from fungi and were found to promote the synthesis of <a href="nerve%20growth%20factor">nerve growth factor</a> in <a href="astroglial%20cell">astroglial cell</a>s. Related compounds isolated and identified from the fungus include three <a href="quinazoline">quinazoline</a> derivatives (a class of compounds rare in nature), dictyoquinazol A, B, and C. These chemicals were shown in laboratory tests to have a protective effect on <a href="cell%20culture">cultured</a> mouse <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s that had been exposed to <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>s. A <a href="total%20synthesis">total synthesis</a> for the dictyoquinazols was reported in 2007.

The fungus has long been recognised to have <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> properties: the addition of the fungus to soup broth was known to prevent it from spoiling for several days. Experiments have shown that extracts of "P. indusiatus" have <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> in addition to <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> properties. Mushroom extracts were tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic to humans, and in some cases had antimicrobial activity comparable to the antibiotics <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a>, <a href="tetracycline">tetracycline</a>, and <a href="nystatin">nystatin</a>. One of the responsible antibiotics, <a href="albaflavenone">albaflavenone</a>, was isolated in 2011. It is a <a href="sesquiterpenoid">sesquiterpenoid</a> that was already known from the soil bacterium "<a href="Streptomyces%20albidoflavus">Streptomyces albidoflavus</a>". The antioxidant effect of the fungus is due to the presence of <a href="polyphenol%20antioxidant">polyphenols</a> whose role in reducing cellular damage from <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a> is well known.

A 2001 publication in the "<a href="International%20Journal%20of%20Medicinal%20Mushrooms">International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms</a>" attempted to determine its efficacy as an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>. In the trial involving only sixteen women, six self-reported the experience of a mild orgasm while smelling the fruit body, and the other ten, who received smaller doses, self-reported an increased <a href="heart%20rate">heart rate</a>. All of the twenty men tested considered the smell displeasing. The study used fruit bodies found in Hawaii, not the edible variety cultivated in China. The study has received criticism. A way to achieve instant orgasms would be expected to gain much attention and many attempts to reproduce the effect, but none has succeeded. No major science journal has published the study, and there are no studies where the results have been reproduced.

False potto

The false potto ("Pseudopotto martini") is a <a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoid</a> primate of uncertain <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> status found in Africa. Anthropologist <a href="Jeffrey%20H.%20Schwartz">Jeffrey H. Schwartz</a> named it in 1996 as the only species of the genus Pseudopotto on the basis of two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as <a href="potto">potto</a>s ("Perodicticus potto"). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, but at least one may have come from <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate <a href="family%20%28taxonomy%29">family</a>, but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.

The false potto generally resembles a small potto, but according to Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a> (an opening in the <a href="humerus">humerus</a>, or upper arm bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in almost half of the specimens in his sample of pottos.

In a series of <a href="potto">potto</a> ("Perodicticus potto") skeletons in the collections of the Anthropological Institute and Museum of the <a href="University%20of%20Zurich">University of Zurich</a> at Irchel, anthropologist <a href="Jeffrey%20H.%20Schwartz">Jeffrey H. Schwartz</a> recognized two specimens with traits he believed distinct from all pottos, and in 1996 he used these two specimens to describe a new genus and species of primate, "Pseudopotto martini". The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Pseudopotto", combines the element "pseudo-" (Greek for "false") with "potto", referring to superficial similarities between the new form and the potto. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "martini", honors primatologist <a href="Robert%20D.%20Martin">Robert D. Martin</a>. The exact provenance of the two specimens is unknown, and one is represented by a complete skeleton (but no skin) and the other by a skull only. Schwartz placed both specimens in a single species, but noted that further study might indicate that the two represent distinct species. He thought the relationships of the new form were unknown and difficult to assess and did not assign it to any <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, but provisionally placed it closest to the family <a href="Lorisidae">Lorisidae</a>, together with the potto, the <a href="angwantibo">angwantibo</a>s, and the <a href="loris">loris</a>es. The discovery, published in the "<a href="Anthropological%20Papers%20of%20the%20American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History</a>", was featured in "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>" and "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>"; the "Science" account noted that Schwartz thought "Pseudopotto" may represent a new family of primates.

In 1998, the journal "<a href="African%20Primates">African Primates</a>" published three papers by primatologists on the false potto. <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a> affirmed that it was probably distinct from the potto and <a href="Simon%20Bearder">Simon Bearder</a> cited it as an example of unrecognized taxonomic diversity in lorisids, but <a href="Esteban%20Sarmiento">Esteban Sarmiento</a> compared the new taxon to specimens of the potto and found that the alleged distinctive traits of the false potto in fact fell within the range of variation of the potto, and that the false potto was probably not even a species distinct from "Perodicticus potto". In 2000, primatologist B.S. Leon agreed that the false potto was not distinct from the <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> "Perodicticus potto potto", but noted that various forms of potto were distinct enough from each other that there may indeed be more than one species of potto. Opinions since then have been divided: a 2003 compilation of African primate diversity concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the false potto is a distinct species, the primate chapter of the 2005 third edition of "<a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>", written by Groves, listed "Pseudopotto" as a genus but noted that it was "controversial"; and Schwartz continued to recognize the false potto as a genus in 2005. Also in 2005, primatologist David Stump reviewed some of the distinguishing features of "Pseudopotto" in the context of studying variation among pottos, and found that some but not all of the false potto's traits were found in some pottos, mainly western populations (subspecies "potto").

One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is an adult female that lived in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%20Zoo">Zürich Zoo</a>. It is represented by a virtually complete skeleton, but the skin was not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs of <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a> and <a href="periodontitis">periodontitis</a> (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen. Schwartz selected this specimen as the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the <a href="mandible%20%28anatomy%29">mandible</a> (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both <a href="permanent%20dentition">permanent</a> and <a href="deciduous%20dentition">deciduous</a> teeth. Specimens of "Pseudopotto" are at least superficially similar to pottos, but according to Schwartz, they differ in a number of traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false potto and true pottos as well as angwantibos and <a href="slow%20loris">slow loris</a>es ("Nycticebus"). The false potto is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation; small size is also seen in western pottos.

The tail, according to Schwartz, is longer than in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes that at least one vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal vertebra</a>e in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though according to Stump the tail of "Pseudopotto" is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its <a href="cervical%20vertebra">cervical</a> (neck) and first and second <a href="thoracic%20vertebra">thoracic</a> (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.

The <a href="ulnar%20styloid%20process">ulnar styloid process</a> (a projection on the <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, one of the bones of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a> (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.

The lacrimal fossa, a depression in the skull, is located on the upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process of the mandible</a> is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.

Other distinguishing features of the false potto are in the dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even from one side of the same individual to another. The third upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> (M3) is more reduced in the false potto than in any other <a href="prosimian">prosimian</a>, according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s ("Phaner"). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, another point of similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in "Pseudopotto", the <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> on the <a href="cheekteeth">cheekteeth</a> are higher, and the <a href="cristid%20obliqua">cristid obliqua</a> (a crest connected to the <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a> cusp) is at a relatively buccal position (in the direction of the cheeks).

In AMZ 6698, skull length is 59.30 mm (2.335 in) and length of the right humerus is 57.65 mm (2.27 in).

According to records in the Anthropological Institute and Museum, AMZ 6698, the holotype, is from "Equatorial Africa", and AMZ-AS 1730 is from the "<a href="Cameroons">Cameroons</a>". According to mammalogist Ronald Nowak, these designations imply that the latter came either from modern <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> or far eastern <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> (<a href="British%20Cameroons">British Cameroons</a>) and the former from Cameroon or a neighboring state. In 1999, Simon Bearder claimed, citing a personal communication by C. Wild, that "Pseudopotto" had been seen in the wild and in 2001, ornithologist Christopher Bowden noted the occurrence of "Pseudopotto" on <a href="Mount%20Kupe">Mount Kupe</a> in Cameroon, also citing C. Wild. However, the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> notes that while sightings of the false potto at 820 to 940 m (2690 to 3080 ft) on Mount Kupe had been reported, surveys had failed to confirm its occurrence there, though pottos, some with long tails, had been found. The false potto is not listed separately from the potto in the Red List, because the evidence that it is a distinct species is considered insufficient.

Anodyne (album)

Anodyne is the fourth and final <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> band <a href="Uncle%20Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a>, released on October 5, 1993. The recording of the album was preceded by the departure of the original <a href="drummer">drummer</a> <a href="Mike%20Heidorn">Mike Heidorn</a> and the addition of three new band members: <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="John%20Stirratt">John Stirratt</a>, drummer <a href="Ken%20Coomer">Ken Coomer</a>, and <a href="multi-instrumentalist">multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="Max%20Johnston">Max Johnston</a>. The band signed with <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a> shortly before recording the album; "Anodyne" was Uncle Tupelo's only major label release until "" in 2002.

Recorded in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, "Anodyne" featured a split in songwriting credits between singers <a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a>, plus a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of the <a href="Doug%20Sahm">Doug Sahm</a> song "Give Back the Key to My Heart", with Sahm on vocals. The lyrical themes were influenced by <a href="country%20music">country music</a> and—more than their preceding releases—touched on <a href="interpersonal%20relationship">interpersonal relationship</a>s. After two promotional tours for the album, tensions between Farrar and Tweedy culminated in the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. Well-received upon its initial release, "Anodyne" was re-mastered and re-released in 2003 by <a href="Rhino%20Entertainment">Rhino Entertainment</a> including five bonus tracks.

<a href="Uncle%20Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a>'s third album, "<a href="March%2016%E2%80%9320%2C%201992">March 16–20, 1992</a>", was released though <a href="Rockville%20Records">Rockville Records</a> on August 3, 1992. On the release, the band eschewed the growing popularity of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> by playing acoustic <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> and <a href="country%20music">country</a> songs "as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene". Drummer <a href="Mike%20Heidorn">Mike Heidorn</a> had a reduced role on the album; because it was an acoustic album, Heidorn added only brush-stroke percussion on a few songs. Heidorn wanted to leave the band to spend more time with his wife and two young children. Though band manager Tony Margherita announced that several major labels were interested in signing Uncle Tupelo, Heidorn decided to permanently leave the band.

Rockville Records refused to pay Uncle Tupelo any royalties, even though the band's first two albums, "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28album%29">No Depression</a>" and "<a href="Still%20Feel%20Gone">Still Feel Gone</a>", sold a combined 40,000 copies. Consequently, Margherita was trying to find a new recording deal for the band. On a recommendation by singer <a href="Gary%20Louris">Gary Louris</a> of <a href="The%20Jayhawks">The Jayhawks</a>, talent scout Joe McEwen pursued the band for a contract with <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a>. McEwen was impressed by how the band was willing to go against trends, calling the band "an alternative to the alternative". Executing an out-clause in their contract with Rockville, Uncle Tupelo signed a seven-record deal with Sire in 1992. The deal guaranteed the release of at least two albums, with a $150,000 budget for the first.

Before releasing their first album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with <a href="Ken%20Coomer">Ken Coomer</a> and <a href="Bill%20Belzer">Bill Belzer</a>. Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European segment of the promotional tour for "March 16–20, 1992" as the opening act for <a href="Sugar%20%28American%20band%29">Sugar</a>. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer was not the only new member added after the tour—Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the "Anodyne" recording sessions. They recruited <a href="multi-instrumentalist">multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="Max%20Johnston">Max Johnston</a> and <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="John%20Stirratt">John Stirratt</a>—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.

"Anodyne" was recorded from May to June 1993 at Cedar Creek studio in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Uncle Tupelo liked the studio because it "just seemed really kind of homey and small and cheap". The album was <a href="Record%20producer">produced</a>, <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a>, and <a href="audio%20engineering">engineered</a> by <a href="Brian%20Paulson">Brian Paulson</a>. The now-expanded lineup inspired Tweedy to spend more time with his bandmates. After Tweedy wrote each song, he would play it to Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston to get their opinions. Farrar interpreted these practice sessions as a sign of Tweedy's increasing arrogance. At live shows, during this time, tensions between Tweedy and Farrar increased and led to verbal altercations.

The album was recorded live in the studio, and each song was recorded in only one take. As a result, the recording sessions for "Anodyne" were completed in two weeks. "Anodyne" was the only Uncle Tupelo album to completely lack overdubbing. Sire was pleased with the album; according to McEwen, "everybody [at the label] considered it a step up from what they'd done before." Farrar wrote six of the songs on the album and Tweedy wrote five, though all the new material was credited to both songwriters. While on tour, Uncle Tupelo met <a href="Texas%20Tornados">Texas Tornados</a> singer <a href="Doug%20Sahm">Doug Sahm</a> at the Hotel Phoenix in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Farrar invited him to join the band in the studio for a <a href="cover%20version">cover</a> of Sahm's "Give Back the Key to My Heart", which Sahm contributed lead vocals to.

The lyrical content of "Anodyne" was influenced by 1950s and 1960s <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, particularly <a href="Ernest%20Tubb">Ernest Tubb</a>, <a href="Buck%20Owens">Buck Owens</a>, and <a href="Lefty%20Frizzell">Lefty Frizzell</a>. Tweedy included several songs referencing aspects of the <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a>. One example was "Acuff-Rose", a <a href="paean">paean</a> on the music publishers of <a href="Acuff-Rose%20Music">Acuff-Rose Music</a>. He also wrote "We've Been Had", which was intended to chastise bands such as <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> and <a href="The%20Clash">The Clash</a> who were "all just show biz" in his opinion. Tweedy was also the author of "New Madrid", a song about <a href="Iben%20Browning">Iben Browning</a>'s erroneous prediction of an <a href="apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> in <a href="New%20Madrid%2C%20Missouri">New Madrid</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. Farrar was less comfortable discussing the lyrics that he wrote, claiming that his songs frequently change their meanings. Like other Uncle Tupelo albums, Farrar and Tweedy wrote their own lyrics, and played them for each other a week before the recording sessions. In comparison to the rest of the Uncle Tupelo catalog, Coomer described the music of the album as "some of [the band's] earlier crunch with the acoustic subtlety of "March 16–20, 1992"".

"Anodyne" was Uncle Tupelo's only recording to appear on the American "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Heatseekers</a> chart. Despite the lack of a <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, "people here thought we were going to have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo."

Despite the label's aspirations, Jay Farrar announced his intention to leave Uncle Tupelo in January 1994. Farrar kept his reasoning secret until fall 1995, when he claimed in an interview that "it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible." As a sign of loyalty to band manager Tony Margherita, who had acquired a $3000 debt on behalf of the band, Farrar agreed to do another promotional tour. Physical altercations between Tweedy and Farrar began two weeks into the tour and continued throughout—many were due to Farrar's refusal to play on Tweedy's songs. Despite Farrar's reservations, Uncle Tupelo performed Tweedy's "The Long Cut" on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a>", the band's only network television appearance. The band played their final concert on May 1, 1994 at <a href="Mississippi%20Nights">Mississippi Nights</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. The remaining members of the "Anodyne" sessions formed <a href="Wilco">Wilco</a> a few weeks later.

The band re-mastered and re-released the album on March 11, 2003 through <a href="Rhino%20Records">Rhino Records</a>. The new version included two previously unreleased songs: Farrar's "Stay True", Tweedy's "Wherever". It also included a cover of <a href="Waylon%20Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a>' "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way?", with vocals by <a href="Joe%20Ely">Joe Ely</a>, a song previously released on the 1993 compilation "Trademark of Quality". Live cover versions of "Truck Drivin' Man" and "<a href="Susie%20Q%20%28song%29">Suzy Q</a>" were also included on the re-issue.

"Anodyne" was well received by critics domestically and internationally. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> writer Jason Ankeny wrote, "Uncle Tupelo never struck a finer balance between rock and country than on "Anodyne"". <a href="Mark%20Kemp">Mark Kemp</a> wrote for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that the band "[has] an intuitive sense of the simplicity and dynamics of a country song." German music periodical "<a href="Spex%20%28magazine%29">Spex</a>" compared the album to <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a> and to <a href="Little%20Feat">Little Feat</a>'s <a href="Little%20Feat%20%28album%29">debut album</a>. "<a href="CMJ">CMJ</a>"s Jim Caligiuri praised "Anodyne" as "another austere, inspired collection". Karen Schoemer of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found that the album "is certainly derivative, but Uncle Tupelo isn't seeking to reinvent its sources, merely to honor them". At the end of the year, "Anodyne" placed at number twenty-eight on "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"'s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll and at number nineteen on the "Spex" critics' poll. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> praised Max Johnston's contributions in the 2004 book "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide" and called the album "Tupelo's finest effort." Norwegian newspaper "<a href="Dagbladet">Dagbladet</a>" listed "Anodyne" in 1999 as one of "The Best Albums of the Century". In 2008, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" critic Tom Moon listed "Anodyne" among the "<a href="1%2C000%20Recordings%20to%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die</a>".

Although the majority of the album's reviews were positive, some critics disagreed. "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>"'s reviewer gave the album three stars out of five and noted that the band needed to "shed some of the Neil Young obsession." Tom Moon of "Rolling Stone" gave the 2003 re-release all five stars, but commented that the bonus tracks there were "pleasant but inconsequential." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> perceived the album as neither a "dud" nor worthy of "honorable mention".

Operation Ironside

Operation Ironside was a Second World War <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a> undertaken by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in 1944. It formed part of <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a>, a broad strategic deception plan instigated by the Allies throughout the year to help cover the June 1944 <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>. Ironside supported the overall deception by suggesting to the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germans</a> that the Allies would subsequently land along the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>. It complemented efforts to deceive the Germans into believing that the Allies would also land in southern France at this time (<a href="Operation%20Zeppelin%20%28deception%20plan%29">Operation Vendetta</a>). <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> was an important port for the German war effort and had already been a target of commando raids two years earlier. Ironside intended to play on German fears of an invasion in the region, with the aim of tying down defensive forces following <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> in June 1944.

Planned by the <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a>, Ironside was communicated to the Germans via double agents between May and June 1944. Unlike other Bodyguard deceptions, the plan was put across entirely by double agents without support by physical deception. Agent Bronx took the lead with support from <a href="Wulf%20Schmidt">Tate</a>, Rudloff and <a href="Joan%20Pujol%20Garcia">Garbo</a>. Ironside's story included an initial two-<a href="division%20%28military%29">division</a> assault, using Overlord formations, staged out of the United Kingdom. This would then be followed up with six divisions sailing from the east coast of the United States. Historians disagree on the impact of Ironside on German plans. There is no indication that the operation was successful in convincing the Germans of imminent Allied plans to invade the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, Allied planners attributed the delay of a <a href="panzer%20division">panzer division</a> moving to Normandy in part to the deception.

As Ironside was a marginal operation, and they were worried about exposing agents as false, the <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Twenty Committee</a> for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.

After the operation closed, at the end of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for <a href="Operation%20Ferdinand">Operation Ferdinand</a>. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase <a href="French%20resistance">French resistance</a> in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was ignored by the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.

Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a> intended to confuse the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific objective was to tie up the <a href="17th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20G%C3%B6tz%20von%20Berlichingen">17th SS</a> and <a href="11th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">11th</a> Panzer divisions deployed in the south of France.

Overall planning for Bodyguard and Ironside rested with <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a> and the <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a> (LCS). The LCS had been set up in 1942 following successes in deception in the Middle East by <a href="Dudley%20Clarke">Dudley Clarke</a>. After initial attempts at deception planning the department was tasked with bringing Bodyguard to fruition. One of their most useful deception channels was through double agents. During the early stages of the war, the <a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a> (German intelligence) had sent spies to Britain, but all of them either surrendered or were captured. Some, along with other volunteers, were used as an extensive misinformation network under the control of the <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Twenty Committee</a>.

<a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> was an important port for the German war effort, receiving a great deal of cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge <a href="submarine%20pen">submarine pen</a>s for <a href="U-boats">U-boats</a>. The <a href="Gironde%20estuary">Gironde estuary</a> and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. <a href="Operation%20Frankton">Operation Frankton</a> was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.

According to the storyline for Ironside, ten days following <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a>, Allied forces would land in the Bordeaux region. This force would spend around twelve days establishing a <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a> before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called <a href="Operation%20Zeppelin%20%28deception%20plan%29%23Vendetta">Operation Vendetta</a>). The supposed target of Ironside was the mouth of the Gironde estuary, with a landing site at <a href="Royan">Royan</a>.

At first, Bevan suggested that the fictional invasion force should stage from the American <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>. Newman Smith, based out of New York and responsible for the US elements of the deception, felt this was an unrealistic story and suggested a large force from the US might conceivably reinforce a bridgehead established by units from the UK. Formations intended for Normandy could be "re-purposed" for the initial invasion. The final plan earmarked two <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Overlord</a> divisions for the assault with the supposed reinforcements consisting of six real divisions (the 26th, 94th, 95th, and 104th Infantry, and the 10th and 11th Armored) under the notional command of Lieutenant General <a href="Lloyd%20Fredendall">Lloyd Fredendall</a>.

Ironside began on 23 May 1944 with the aim of having the threat established by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, under the control of the Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important agents to pass over the deception.

The lead was given to the less important Agent Bronx, a Peruvian socialite named <a href="Elvira%20Chaudoir">Elvira Chaudoir</a>, who communicated with her German handlers via letter. From April 1944, she had also begun sending codes as <a href="telegram">telegram</a>s, which were faster than letters in the event of an imminent invasion. Her code was based on a financial theme, assigning different amounts of money to possible invasion sites. Mentioning her doctor (almost certain) or dentist (certain) showed Chaudoir's confidence in the information. Asking for the money "straight away", "urgently" or "quickly" identified when the invasion would take place (within a week, a fortnight or a month, respectively).

Agent Tate (a <a href="Danes">Dane</a> sent to England in 1941 and turned double shortly after) opened the operation, on 23 May, in a message to his German handlers stating that a friend from the US had identified an expeditionary force, consisting of six divisions, preparing to sail. On 29 May, Bronx sent a telegram identifying an invasion targeted at the Bordeaux region within a month, using the code "dentist" to say she was certain of the information. She also sent a follow-up letter explaining that the information came from a drunken British officer in the <a href="Four%20Hundred%20Club">Four Hundred Club</a> who had later sworn her to secrecy. According to Bronx, the officer had boasted about an airborne assault in the Bordeaux region that would be in the papers the following morning. The next day he had told her the operation had been delayed by a month.

Although many messages were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic and as a result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, <a href="Joan%20Pujol%20Garcia">Garbo</a>, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.

Messages were also sent from the US. Rudloff, an agent based in the New York, sent four reports between 2 and 20 June. He identified the six divisions under Fredendall being sidelined for specialist training in bridge building but not amphibious assault and under heavy security. A last-minute deception involved an <a href="MI6">MI6</a> transmitter in France. Known to be under German control, when the operator asked about routes to send escaped <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> the handlers replied that they should, from 15 June, be sent toward Bordeaux.

German intelligence documents indicate that there was never strong belief that the Allies were ready to land in the Bordeaux region. Intercepted situation reports suggested that the Germans believed rumours of landings in the area to be "cover operations of small caliber" and part of the cover for a main Allied thrust at <a href="Calais">Calais</a> (in itself a deception called <a href="Operation%20Fortitude">Operation Fortitude</a> South). Axis commanders had considered the idea and conducted exercises in preparation, and training continued in the region after D-Day. Following the Normandy invasion, the Allies had expected both German divisions in the Bordeaux area to mobilise. In the end, only the 17th SS Panzer Division moved north, and even they were delayed by several days, whilst the 11th Panzer Division remained to guard the region.

Historians are divided over whether the deception played a major role in the German response. Most, such as historian Ben McIntyre, agree that Ironside added to the general picture of confusion for the German commanders. McIntyre quotes senior Allied figures, such as <a href="John%20Cecil%20Masterman">John Masterman</a> (chair of the Twenty committee) and Hugh Astor (MI5), who attributed the delayed German response in part to Ironside. <a href="Michael%20Howard%20%28historian%29">Michael Howard</a> dismisses the impact of the operation saying that there is "no evidence that anyone took them seriously".

Part of the problem was that Bordeaux may not have appeared a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">German High Command</a> had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded in the same way as deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.

John Bevan had asked Newman Smith to retain the threat of a US invasion force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began <a href="Operation%20Ferdinand">Operation Ferdinand</a>, a cover deception for <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">Operation Dragoon</a>, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but <a href="Noel%20Wild">Noel Wild</a> and <a href="Ops%20%28B%29">Ops (B)</a>, the <a href="SHAEF">SHAEF</a> deception planners were worried about the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.

Henry Cornelius Burnett

Henry Cornelius Burnett (October 25, 1825 – October 1, 1866) was an American politician who served as a <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate States Senator</a> from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> from 1862 to 1865. From 1855 to 1861, Burnett served four terms in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. A lawyer by profession, Burnett had held only one public office—circuit court clerk—before being elected to Congress. He represented <a href="Kentucky%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's 1st congressional district</a> immediately prior to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. This district contained the entire <a href="Jackson%20Purchase">Jackson Purchase</a> region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> <a href="arraignment">arraigned</a> for <a href="treason">treason</a>. Unionist newspaper editor <a href="George%20D.%20Prentice">George D. Prentice</a> described Burnett as "a big, burly, loud-mouthed fellow who is forever raising <a href="point%20of%20order">points of order</a> and objections, to embarrass the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> in the House".

Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a> in 1861 that formed a <a href="Confederate%20government%20of%20Kentucky">Confederate government</a> for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate <a href="regiment">regiment</a> at <a href="Hopkinsville%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkinsville, Kentucky</a>, and briefly served in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a>. Camp Burnett, a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of <a href="Clinton%2C%20Kentucky">Clinton</a> in <a href="Hickman%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hickman County, Kentucky</a>, was named after him.

Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was <a href="Expulsion%20from%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">expelled</a> from the House in 1861. He is one of only five members of the House of Representatives ever to be expelled. Following his expulsion, Burnett served in the <a href="Provisional%20Confederate%20Congress">Provisional Confederate Congress</a> and the First and Second <a href="Confederate%20Senate">Confederate Senate</a>s. He was indicted for treason after the war, but never tried. He returned to the practice of law, and died of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> in 1866 at the age of 40.

Henry Cornelius Burnett was born to Dr. Isaac Burnett (1801-1865) and his wife, the former Martha F. Garrett on October 25, 1825, in <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20Virginia">Essex County, Virginia</a>. In his early childhood, the family moved to <a href="Cadiz%2C%20Kentucky">Cadiz</a>, <a href="Trigg%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Trigg County, Kentucky</a>. Henry was educated privately at an academy in <a href="Hopkinsville%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkinsville</a>, the neighboring <a href="Christian%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Christian County</a> government seat. He then read law and was a member of the Cadiz Christian Church.

On April 13, 1847, Burnett married Mary A. Terry, the daughter of a prominent Cadiz merchant. They had four children: John, Emeline, Henry, and Terry (who died shortly after birth). The younger Henry C. Burnett (educated at the University of Virginia after his father's death) became a successful lawyer in <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a> and, later, <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>.

<a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">Admitted to the bar</a> in 1847, Burnett established his legal practice in Cadiz. He also began owning slaves of his own. He owned five slaves in Trigg County in 1850. Ten years later, in 1860, Burnett owned seven slaves in Cadiz, as well as leased three slaves to J.L. Parrish in Christian County.

In the first election following the ratification of the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a> of 1850, Trigg County voters elected Burnett clerk of the <a href="circuit%20court">circuit court</a>; he defeated James E. Thompson. Burnett resigned in 1853 to run for Congress.

Later that year, he was elected as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> to the <a href="34th%20United%20States%20Congress">34th Congress</a>, succeeding <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Linn%20Boyd">Linn Boyd</a>. He was re-elected to the three succeeding Congresses; during the <a href="35th%20United%20States%20Congress">35th Congress</a>, he chaired the Committee of Enquiry regarding the sale of <a href="Fort%20Snelling">Fort Snelling</a> and served on the Committee on the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>.

Burnett supported fellow Kentuckian <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> for president in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 presidential election</a>, but Breckinridge lost to Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. His victory in the election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> from the Union. Despite this, most Americans believed the Union could still be saved. Burnett, however, disagreed. In the January 7, 1861 issue of Paducah's "Tri-Weekly Herald", he declared, "There is not the slightest hope of any settlement or adjustment of existing troubles." Despite his pessimism, Burnett endorsed the ill-fated <a href="Peace%20Conference%20of%201861">Peace Conference of 1861</a>.

Following the rapid secessions of <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, and <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, Congress began preparing the nation for war, including by strengthening the <a href="United%20States%20Army">army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">navy</a> and raising funds for the treasury. Burnett attempted to circumvent these measures by proposing an amendment stipulating that none of these new appropriations could be used to subdue or make war against any of the southern states, but the amendment was defeated.
To avert war then, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> called for a meeting of <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> to convene in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> on May 27. Kentucky's twelve delegates to the convention were to be chosen by special election on May 4. However, after the Confederates fired on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> on April 12, the secessionist candidates withdrew from the election. Expressing the view of the majority of these delegates, Burnett opined in the "Tri-Weekly Herald" that the convention would not occur. He was wrong; the convention was held as scheduled, but it failed to accomplish anything of significance.

President Lincoln called for special congressional elections to be held in Kentucky in June 1861. The voters of the First District's Southern Rights party called a meeting to be held May 29, 1861 at the <a href="Graves%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Graves County</a> courthouse in <a href="Mayfield%2C%20Kentucky">Mayfield</a>. The purpose of the meeting was ostensibly to re-nominate Burnett for his congressional seat, but some Unionists believed an ulterior motive was in play. <a href="George%20D.%20Prentice">George D. Prentice</a>, editor of the Unionist "Louisville Journal", wrote on May 21, 1861 that "the object of [the Mayfield Convention], though not officially explained, is believed to be the separation of the First District from Kentucky if Kentucky remains in the Union, and its annexation to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>".
Most of the records of the Mayfield Convention were lost, presumably in a fire that destroyed the courthouse in 1864. The most extensive surviving record comes from the notes of James Beadles, a Unionist observer of the proceedings. After a number of speeches were delivered, a majority committee chaired by Paducah circuit judge James Campbell presented a report containing seven resolutions. The resolutions declared the region's sympathy with the South, although it pledged to abide by Kentucky's present policy of neutrality. It condemned President Lincoln for waging an unjust war, and praised <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a> for refusing Lincoln's call for troops. The report also condemned the federal government for arming Union sympathizers in the state with so-called "Lincoln guns". A minority committee report was given by <a href="Ballard%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Ballard County</a> resident and future U.S. Representative <a href="Oscar%20Turner%20%281867%29">Oscar Turner</a>. This report called Kentucky's neutrality "futile" and "cowardly," promised to fight off any invasion by the North, and recommended calling for aid from Tennessee and the Confederate States in the event of such an invasion. It further warned that if the entire state did not adopt this position, the Purchase region would secede and align itself with Tennessee.

Burnett, along with <a href="Lyon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lyon County</a>'s <a href="Willis%20B.%20Machen">Willis B. Machen</a> and <a href="Union%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Union County</a>'s Benjamin P. Cissell, initially endorsed Campbell's majority report. After some debate, Burnett proposed four resolutions in lieu of both reports. The resolutions condemned President Lincoln for the war against the South and the federal government for the provision of the "Lincoln guns". They also praised Governor Magoffin for rebuffing Lincoln's call for troops and encouraged him to drive away any Union invasion of the state. Burnett's resolutions were passed by large margins in preference to both the majority and minority reports.

Finally, the convention turned to the issue of nominating Burnett. Four others, including Turner, Machen, and Cissell, were also offered as nominees. Burnett received 124 of 155 votes on the first ballot and was chosen unanimously on the second ballot. In his acceptance speech, Burnett declared that he was undecided as to whether he would take the <a href="Oath%20of%20office%23United%20States">oath of office</a> if elected. This statement alluded to an earlier comment by Turner that "no man who is engaged in the cause of the South could go to Congress and take the oath of office without <a href="perjury">perjuring</a> himself." Burnett promised that if he did assume his seat, he was determined to arraign President Lincoln for treason.

In the special elections, Burnett defeated <a href="Lawrence%20Trimble">Lawrence Trimble</a> of Paducah. He was the only <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> candidate elected in the statewide canvass. He won handily in the Jackson Purchase region, which was by far the most pro-Southern area of the state. However, outside the Purchase, he won only his home county of Trigg, and that by a slim margin of 20 votes. (Besides the Purchase counties, the First District also included <a href="Caldwell%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Caldwell</a>, <a href="Crittenden%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Crittenden</a>, <a href="Hopkins%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkins</a>, <a href="Livingston%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Livingston</a>, Lyon, Trigg, Union, and <a href="Webster%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Webster</a> counties.)

Burnett took his seat in the <a href="37th%20United%20States%20Congress">37th Congress</a>; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat not to take the oath of office. Just days after the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> proposed a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be <a href="division%20%28vote%29">divided</a>. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.

After Congress adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett returned home to Cadiz and spoke at a number of pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leonidas%20Polk">Leonidas Polk</a> violated Kentucky's neutrality by ordering <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Gideon%20Johnson%20Pillow">Gideon Johnson Pillow</a> to occupy <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus</a>. In response, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.

In the interim between the two conventions, Burnett traveled to Hopkinsville, where he and <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="W.C.P.%20Breckinridge">W.C.P. Breckinridge</a> raised a Confederate regiment dubbed the <a href="8th%20Kentucky%20Infantry">8th Kentucky Infantry</a>. On November 11, 1861, Burnett himself enlisted in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> at Camp Alcorn; he was chosen as colonel of the 8th Kentucky, but never took command.
The sovereignty convention gathered at the <a href="William%20Forst%20House">William Forst House</a> in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over this convention. Fearing for the safety of the delegates, he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County</a>'s <a href="George%20W.%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">George W. Johnson</a> convinced the majority of the delegates to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of <a href="Bethel%20College%20%28Kentucky%29">Bethel Female College</a>, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.

The convention passed an ordinance of secession and established a provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. Burnett, <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a> of <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a> and <a href="William%20E.%20Simms">William E. Simms</a> of <a href="Bourbon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Bourbon County</a> were chosen as commissioners for the provisional government and were dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to negotiate with Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. <a href="Luke%20P.%20Blackburn">Luke P. Blackburn</a>, a native Kentuckian living in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, was invited to accompany the commissioners. Despite the fact that Kentucky's elected government in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> had opposed secession, the commissioners convinced Davis to recommend Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy; the Confederate Congress officially admitted Kentucky on December 10, 1861.

Following his successful mission to Richmond, Burnett joined the 8th Kentucky at <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a>. On February 16, 1862, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> led a combined Federal army-navy attack against the fort. Most of the Confederate garrison was captured, including the 8th Kentucky, but Burnett escaped in <a href="General%20officer">General</a> <a href="John%20B.%20Floyd">John B. Floyd</a>'s retreat following the defeat. This battle ended Burnett's military service.

Burnett's subversive activities did not go unnoticed by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> representative <a href="William%20M.%20Dunn">W. McKee Dunn</a> introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.

Burnett represented Kentucky in the Provisional Confederate Congress from November 18, 1861 to February 17, 1862, and served as a member of that body's Finance Committee. He was then elected as a senator to the <a href="First%20Confederate%20Congress">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Confederate%20Congress">Second Confederate Congress</a>es, serving from February 19, 1862 to February 18, 1865. In the Confederate Senate, he served on the Engrossment and Enrollment and Military Affairs Committees.

On March 29, Confederate president <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> called on the Confederate Congress to pass a <a href="conscription">conscription</a> bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men between the ages of 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a>. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.

Following the conclusion of the Civil War, Burnett sought an audience with President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, an old congressional colleague, but Johnson told him to go home. Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville, but released on bond and never prosecuted. He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz. He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28, 1866. Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery, he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz. His tombstone bears no mention of his Confederate service.

Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey

The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is an elected constitutional officer in the <a href="executive%20branch">executive branch</a> of the <a href="Government%20of%20New%20Jersey">state government</a> of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in the United States. The lieutenant governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a <a href="Ticket%20%28election%29">ticket</a> with the <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">governor</a> for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the <a href="order%20of%20succession">order of succession</a>, the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet-level</a> <a href="Government%20of%20New%20Jersey%23Executive%23Departments">department</a> or <a href="Government%20agency">administrative agency</a> within the governor's administration.

Prior to 2010, New Jersey was one of a few <a href="U.S.%20state">states in the United States</a> that did not have a <a href="Lieutenant%20governor%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant governor</a> to succeed to the governorship in the event of a vacancy in that office. Only two individuals had previously held the title—both during brief periods in the <a href="Colonial%20history%20of%20New%20Jersey">colonial era</a> (1664–1776) under commission or <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> from the <a href="The%20Crown">British Crown</a>. For most of the state's (and previously the colony's) history, a vacancy in the position of governor was filled by the president of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Senate">State Senate</a> (called the "<a href="New%20Jersey%20Legislative%20Council">Legislative Council</a>" from 1776 to 1844), or during the colonial era by the president of the royal governor's <a href="New%20Jersey%20Provincial%20Council">Provincial Council</a>.

After several episodes during which the state had multiple "<a href="acting%20governor">acting governor</a>s" in the span of a few years following the <a href="resignation">resignation</a>s of Governor <a href="Christine%20Todd%20Whitman">Christine Todd Whitman</a> in 2001 and Governor <a href="James%20E.%20McGreevey">James E. McGreevey</a> in 2004, popular sentiment and political pressure from the state's residents and <a href="News%20media">news media outlets</a> sought a permanent and tenable solution to the issue of gubernatorial succession. A referendum put before the state's voters authorized the <a href="constitutional%20amendment">amendment</a> of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20New%20Jersey">state's constitution</a> in 2006. This amendment provided for the state's first lieutenant governor to be elected in the state's 2009 gubernatorial election.

Republican <a href="Kim%20Guadagno">Kim Guadagno</a> was the first to serve in the post in its modern form. Guadagno, previously the <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States%23New%20Jersey">sheriff</a> in <a href="Monmouth%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Monmouth County</a>, was chosen by Governor <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a> to be his <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a> on the Republican party ticket in the 2009 election. In 2017, Democratic <a href="New%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly">New Jersey Assemblywoman</a> and former Speaker of the Assembly <a href="Sheila%20Oliver">Sheila Oliver</a> was elected lieutenant governor as the running mate of <a href="Phil%20Murphy">Phil Murphy</a>, and was sworn in as the second lieutenant governor on January 16, 2018.

During the <a href="Colonial%20history%20of%20New%20Jersey%23Proprietary%20Colony">proprietary period</a> (1664–1702), New Jersey was divided into two separate colonies, <a href="East%20Jersey">East Jersey</a> and <a href="West%20Jersey">West Jersey</a>. These were often administered in its first years by deputies who resided in North America and represented the province's governor and its major investors (the "proprietors"), who typically resided in <a href="London">London</a>. In 1702, the proprietors of East and West Jersey surrendered their political authority to <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>. The Queen united both provinces into one <a href="crown%20colony">crown colony</a> to be administered by a royal governor appointed by the Crown.

Only two individuals held the post of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey during its colonial history. This position existed by direct commission from the British monarch only for two brief periods, 1702–09 and 1755–57. For most of the colonial period, in the event of the resignation, prolonged absence or death of the royal governor, the province would be administered by an "acting governor" who was the president of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Provincial%20Council">Provincial Council</a> (also called the "Governor's Council")—the upper house of the colonial legislature. The council presidency was an honorary ceremonial post given to the council's oldest member.

<a href="Richard%20Ingoldesby">Richard Ingoldesby</a> (d. 1719), a British army captain who was dispatched to New York to restore royal authority in New York after <a href="Leisler%27s%20Rebellion">Leisler's Rebellion</a>, was commissioned as the Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and New York in November 1702. Ingoldesby served under the colony's first royal governor, <a href="Edward%20Hyde%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury</a> and then his successor <a href="John%20Lovelace%2C%204th%20Baron%20Lovelace">John Lovelace, 4th Baron Lovelace</a>. Although Lord Cornbury was frequently absent from New Jersey and focused most of his efforts in New York, he refused to permit Ingoldesby any authority to govern. Ingoldesby became acting governor of both provinces briefly after the sudden death of Lord Lovelace on May 6, 1709. However, his authority was opposed by rival factions of the colony's proprietors who asserted that his commission was invalid. Ingoldesby further angered the colony's Quaker leaders after he retaliated against them for their opposition to raising troops from New Jersey to support a planned invasion of French colonies in Canada. His commission as governor was revoked in October 1709, but the news of his removal did not reach him until April 1710.

The second lieutenant governor, <a href="Thomas%20Pownall">Thomas Pownall</a> (1722–1805), was appointed to the post in 1755 under royal governor <a href="Jonathan%20Belcher">Jonathan Belcher</a> (1681/2–1757). Pownall had little responsibility beyond anticipating the death of the aging governor who for most of his tenure was in declining health from a progressive paralytic disorder. Belcher lived longer than expected, and Pownall grew restless. In 1756, Pownall journeyed to England, where he was offered the governorship of Pennsylvania, which was retracted after he made demands for wide-ranging powers. While in England, Pownall advised the <a href="Pitt%E2%80%93Newcastle%20ministry">government</a> organized by <a href="Thomas%20Pelham-Holles%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle</a>, and his close foreign affairs advisor <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt</a> on the state of affairs in the colonies during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (called the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> in North America). Because the insights and first-hand knowledge he shared had impressed his superiors in Britain, Pownall was commissioned as <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Massachusetts">Royal Governor of Massachusetts</a> in March 1757. Pownall arrived in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> to assume the new post on August 3, 1757. When Belcher died on August 31, 1757, Pownall did not assume the governorship of New Jersey. Pownall's appointment in Massachusetts left the New Jersey to be administered by <a href="John%20Reading%20%28New%20Jersey%29">John Reading</a> (1686–1767) in his second tenure as "acting governor"—continuing the previous convention of the president of the <a href="Governor%27s%20Council">Governor's Council</a> assuming the governorship in an acting capacity. Reading assumed the post reluctantly, after first requesting unsuccessfully that Pownall return to New Jersey to assume the office.

From Ingoldesby's removal in 1710 until the tenure of Pownall, four appointed royal governors (<a href="John%20Montgomerie">John Montgomerie</a>, <a href="William%20Cosby">Sir William Cosby</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Morris%20%28governor%29">Lewis Morris</a>, and Jonathan Belcher) died in office and were replaced with acting governors from the provincial council. Two of these acting governors (<a href="John%20Anderson%20%28New%20Jersey%29">John Anderson</a> and <a href="John%20Hamilton%20%28New%20Jersey%29">John Hamilton</a>) died in office, and were replaced by another acting governor drawn from the members of the provincial council.

Prior to the creation of the modern lieutenant governor position, the only state-wide, <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">non-federal</a>, elected office was the <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor of New Jersey</a>. New Jersey was one of eight states without a lieutenant governor and one of four states without any other state-wide elected official (including county prosecutors). Further, the state constitution does not provide for elections for state-wide <a href="cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a>-level positions—it grants the governor the power to appoint the "principal department heads" for the executive branch. For these reasons, New Jersey's governor was considered the most powerful elected chief executive in the United States.

In the event of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state constitution specified that the President of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Senate">New Jersey State Senate</a>, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly">New Jersey General Assembly</a>, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.

On several occasions in the state's history, proposals for a lieutenant governor were raised and rejected. Governor <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Driscoll">Alfred E. Driscoll</a> backed a proposal to create the office in 1947 as the state was rewriting its constitution at a <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> held at <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a> in <a href="New%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey">New Brunswick</a>. Driscoll's proposal was not approved. In 1986, Governor <a href="Thomas%20Kean">Thomas Kean</a> proposed the creation of the office in a move seen at the time as a political maneuver "apparently to preclude the possibility of a Democratic successor" as Kean was being considered as a viable presidential or senatorial candidate in the 1988 election and the senate president was a Democrat. Kean's proposal was not successful.

New Jersey had two recent periods during which several politicians assumed the governorship within the span of a few years. In 2001, Governor <a href="Christine%20Todd%20Whitman">Christine Todd Whitman</a> resigned with one year remaining in her second term after being appointed by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> to the position of administrator of the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal</a> <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Senate President <a href="Donald%20DiFrancesco">Donald DiFrancesco</a> became acting governor following Whitman's resignation on January 31, 2001, and remained in office until he retired from the state senate on January 8, 2002. 

In an unusual political circumstance, the 2001 legislative elections returned a senate with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, with each party having 20 senators. Both sides negotiated to choose two senators from their respective parties to serve as co-presidents. Because of an 8-day gap between the seating of the new state legislature and the inauguration of Governor-elect <a href="Jim%20McGreevey">Jim McGreevey</a>, four men held the position of acting governor:

After Governor Jim McGreevey <a href="Jim%20McGreevey%23Political%20career%23Governorship%20of%20New%20Jersey%23Resignation">resigned</a> in the midst of a sex scandal in 2004, Richard Codey served again as acting governor from November 15, 2004 to January 17, 2006. Codey was the only acting governor during this time, as the 2003 legislative elections had given the Democrats outright control of the state senate. Codey's tenure ended with the inauguration of Governor <a href="Jon%20Corzine">Jon Corzine</a> on January 17, 2006.

Public attention was directed to the issue of succession in the wake of the resignations of Whitman and McGreevey during so brief a period. The response of the general public and the media was that the situation of acting governors and resignations made the situation untenable and that the state needed a permanent solution such as a lieutenant governor. There were three chief arguments in favor of establishing a lieutenant governor:

In 2005, the state legislature passed resolutions for a proposed constitutional amendment to create the position of lieutenant governor. In accordance with the state constitution, this proposal was put before the voters as a <a href="referendum">public question</a> on the ballot for the <a href="New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202005">general election</a> held on November 8, 2005. The General Assembly considered legislation, designated as "Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 100" (ACR100), which it passed on February 24, 2005, with 73 votes in favor and 1 opposed The senate followed by approving the legislation, under the title "Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 2 (SCR2), with 32 votes in favor and 5 opposed on March 21, 2005. The senate was still run by Acting Governor Richard Codey as senate president.

The question proposed on the ballot read:

Shall the amendment of Articles II, IV, V and XI of the Constitution, agreed to by the Legislature, establishing the office of lieutenant governor, and providing for the term, election, succession, salary, qualifications, and duties of the office, and for an interim succession to be employed in the event of a vacancy in the office of the governor before the election of the first lieutenant governor, be adopted?

The amendment question was approved by voters by a tally of 836,134 votes (56.1%) to 655,333 (43.9%). In the interim period before the next election in 2009, any vacancy in the office of governor after January 17, 2006 would be filled first by the senate president, followed by the speaker of the general assembly, who would vacate their legislative seat upon assuming the governor's office.

New Jersey elected its first lieutenant governor in 2009. After the primary election in June 2009, Governor Corzine signed into law A.3902, a bill from the state legislature that sought to clarify a vague passage in the state constitution concerning a gubernatorial candidate's selection of a running mate. Corzine signed the bill into law on June 25, 2009. The constitution provided that a gubernatorial candidate select a running mate within 30 days after the "nomination." The confusion that arose concerned whether the "nomination" was the date of the primary election or the date that the vote count of that election was confirmed as final and certified by the state's Secretary of State. As defined by state law, the primary election is held on "Tuesday after the first Monday in June". However, the reported winner of a primary election is not official until the state's 21 county clerks are canvassed for official results after an election. This allows time for the Secretary of State to tabulate stray late <a href="absentee%20ballot">absentee ballot</a>s (i.e. from military voters stationed outside the state); calculate final adjustments of vote tallies; litigate legal disputes; and conduct <a href="Election%20recount">recounts</a> if necessary. A.3902 provided a clarification of this deadline as "30 days after primary results are certified by the secretary of state, not the primary election itself." The bill also reduced the number of days in which the June primary election results must be certified from 86 days (which would place the deadline in August) to the fourth Friday in June, less than 4 weeks after the election. By enacting this bill, New Jersey's gubernatorial candidates had an extra three-and-a-half weeks to announce their selection of a lieutenant governor running mate. The 2009 deadline for such an announcement was moved from July 2 (30 days after the primary election) to July 27 (30 days after the certification of election results).

In the week before the deadline, the three candidates nominated for governor and running in the November general election selected their running mates. The incumbent, Democratic nominee Governor Jon Corzine, chose State Senator <a href="Loretta%20Weinberg">Loretta Weinberg</a>. His Republican challenger, <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a>, a former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, selected Monmouth County Sheriff <a href="Kim%20Guadagno">Kim Guadagno</a>. Independent candidate <a href="Chris%20Daggett">Chris Daggett</a> selected <a href="Frank%20J.%20Esposito">Frank J. Esposito</a>, a history professor and former administrator at <a href="Kean%20University">Kean University</a>. On November 3, 2009, Christie defeated Corzine by a margin of 48.5% (1,174,445 votes) to 44.9% (1,087,731 votes), with 5.8% (139,579 votes) of the vote going to Daggett. With Christie's election as governor, Kim Guadagno was slated to become the state's first lieutenant governor in its modern form. Christie and Guadagno were installed at inaugural ceremonies held on January 19, 2010.

In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Guadagno was again chosen as lieutenant governor as Christie's running mate. The Christie-Guadagno ticket defeated Democratic candidates state Senator <a href="Barbara%20Buono">Barbara Buono</a> (for governor) and labor union leader Milly Silva (for lieutenant governor.) In 2017, after winning the Republican primary for governor, Guadagno chose Woodcliff Lake Mayor <a href="Carlos%20Rendo">Carlos Rendo</a> as her running mate. <a href="Phil%20Murphy">Phil Murphy</a>, winner of the Democratic primary for governor, selected Assemblywoman <a href="Sheila%20Oliver">Sheila Oliver</a> for the second spot on his ticket. The Murphy-Oliver democratic team ticket defeated the Guadagno-Rendo republican ticket in November of the same year's general gubernatorial election .

As amended on January 17, 2006, New Jersey's state constitution mandates that a person may only be eligible for the position of lieutenant governor if they meet the eligibility qualifications to serve as governor. Article V, Section I, paragraph 2, requires that a candidate for governor (and thus lieutenant governor) be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least 20 years, and a resident of New Jersey for at least seven years. Within 30 days after the certification of the statewide <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a>, the candidate for governor selects a <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a> to join his or her ticket as the candidate for lieutenant governor. The governor and lieutenant governor must be members of the same political party. As candidates they campaign on the same ticket, are elected conjointly, and serve the same four-year term concurrently.

Additional requirements are imposed by Article V, Section I, paragraph 10 of the state constitution, which provides that the lieutenant governor be appointed as a head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration, with the exception that he or she cannot be the state's attorney general. The current lieutenant governor, Sheila Oliver, serves as New Jersey's Commissioner of Community Affairs.

The <a href="order%20of%20succession">order of succession</a> in the event the governor's office is left vacant is specified in Article V, Section I, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey State Constitution, as amended, effective January 17, 2006, which states:

<poem>In the event of a vacancy in the office of Governor resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a Governor in office, or the death of a Governor-elect, or from any other cause, the Lieutenant Governor shall become Governor, until a new Governor is elected and qualifies.

In the event of simultaneous vacancies in both the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor resulting from any cause, the President of the Senate shall become Governor until a new Governor or Lieutenant Governor is elected and qualifies. In the event that there is a vacancy in the office of Senate President, or the Senate President declines to become Governor, then the Speaker of the General Assembly shall become Governor until a new Governor or Lieutenant Governor is elected and qualifies. In the event that there is a vacancy in the office of Speaker of the General Assembly, or if the Speaker declines to become Governor, then the functions, powers, duties and emoluments of the office shall devolve for the time being upon such officers and in the order of succession as may be provided by law, until a new Governor or Lieutenant Governor is elected and qualifies.</poem>

Stone went on to portray <a href="Billie%20Jean%20King">Billie Jean King</a> in the biographical sports film "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sexes%20%282017%20film%29">Battle of the Sexes</a>" (2017) and <a href="Abigail%20Masham">Abigail Masham</a> in the historical comedy-drama "<a href="The%20Favourite%20%28film%29">The Favourite</a>" (2018). Her performance in the latter earned her another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 2018, she starred in the <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> dark comedy miniseries "<a href="Maniac%20%28miniseries%29">Maniac</a>".

Emily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>, to Krista Jean Stone ("<a href="Given%20name%23Name%20at%20birth">née</a>" Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company. Stone lived on the grounds of the <a href="Camelback%20Inn">Camelback Inn</a> resort from the age of 12 to 15. She has a younger brother, Spencer. Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that <a href="Anglicisation">anglicized</a> their surname to "Stone" when they immigrated to the United States through <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a>. She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.
As an infant, Stone had <a href="baby%20colic">baby colic</a> and cried frequently; she consequently developed <a href="Vocal%20fold%20nodule">nodules</a> and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child. Stone has described herself as having been "loud" and "bossy" while growing up. She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended <a href="Scottsdale%20Unified%20School%20District">Cocopah Middle School</a> for the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that "I made sure I got all <a href="Grading%20%28education%29">As</a>". Stone suffered <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>s as a child, which she says caused a decline in her social skills. She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.

Stone started acting at age four; she wanted a career in <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years. Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage production of "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows">The Wind in the Willows</a>", playing the part of Otter. The actress was <a href="Homeschooling">homeschooled</a> for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix's <a href="Valley%20Youth%20Theatre">Valley Youth Theatre</a>—including "<a href="The%20Princess%20and%20the%20Pea">The Princess and the Pea</a>", "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>", and "<a href="Joseph%20and%20the%20Amazing%20Technicolor%20Dreamcoat">Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</a>"—and performed with the theater's <a href="improvisational%20theatre">improvisational comedy</a> troupe. Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s "<a href="All%20That">All That</a>". Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the <a href="William%20Morris%20Agency">William Morris Agency</a> in the 1970s.

Stone attended <a href="Xavier%20College%20Preparatory%20%28Arizona%29">Xavier College Preparatory</a>an all-girl <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic high school</a>as a freshman, but <a href="High%20school%20dropouts">dropped out</a> after one semester to become an actress. She prepared a <a href="Microsoft%20PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a> presentation for her parents titled "Project Hollywood" (featuring <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>'s 2003 song "<a href="Hollywood%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Hollywood</a>") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career. In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalls: "I went up for every single show on the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom", adding, "I ended up getting none." Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes, and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.

When Stone registered for the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>, the name "Emily Stone" was already taken. She initially chose to go by "Riley Stone", but after guest-starring in the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> drama "<a href="Medium%20%28TV%20series%29">Medium</a>" and the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> sitcom "<a href="Malcolm%20in%20the%20Middle">Malcolm in the Middle</a>", she decided that she was more comfortable with "Emma". She chose to use "Emma" in honor of <a href="Emma%20Bunton">Emma Bunton</a>, aka Baby Spice from <a href="the%20Spice%20Girls">the Spice Girls</a>. She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the <a href="VH1">VH1</a> talent competition reality show "In Search of the New Partridge Family" (2004). The resulting show, retitled "<a href="The%20New%20Partridge%20Family">The New Partridge Family</a>" (2004), remained an unsold pilot. She followed this with a guest appearance in <a href="Louis%20C.K.">Louis C.K.</a>'s <a href="HBO">HBO</a> series "<a href="Lucky%20Louie">Lucky Louie</a>". She auditioned to star as <a href="Claire%20Bennet">Claire Bennet</a> in the NBC science fiction drama <a href="Heroes%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"Heroes"</a> (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her "rock bottom" experience. In April 2007, she played <a href="List%20of%20Drive%20characters%23Violet%20Trimble">Violet Trimble</a> in the Fox action drama "<a href="Drive%20%282007%20TV%20series%29">Drive</a>", but the show was canceled after seven episodes.

Stone made her feature film debut in <a href="Greg%20Mottola">Greg Mottola</a>'s comedy "<a href="Superbad%20%28film%29">Superbad</a>" (2007), co-starring <a href="Michael%20Cera">Michael Cera</a> and <a href="Jonah%20Hill">Jonah Hill</a>. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill's romantic interest, she dyed her hair red. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" found her "appealing", but felt that her role was poorly written. Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as "amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I've had since then". The film was a commercial success, and earned her the <a href="Young%20Hollywood%20Award">Young Hollywood Award</a> for Exciting New Face.

The following year, Stone starred in the comedy "<a href="The%20Rocker%20%28film%29">The Rocker</a>" (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the "straight face" <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>ist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as "a big smiler and laugher", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy "<a href="The%20House%20Bunny">The House Bunny</a>", performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play the president of a sorority, and perform a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of <a href="the%20Waitresses">the Waitresses</a>' 1982 song "<a href="I%20Know%20What%20Boys%20Like%20%28song%29">I Know What Boys Like</a>". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: "She's positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her."

Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Garner">Jennifer Garner</a> and <a href="Michael%20Douglas">Michael Douglas</a> in <a href="Mark%20Waters%20%28director%29">Mark Waters</a>' "<a href="Ghosts%20of%20Girlfriends%20Past">Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</a>". Loosely based on <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' 1843 <a href="novella">novella</a> "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success. Her most financially profitable venture that year was <a href="Ruben%20Fleischer">Ruben Fleischer</a>'s $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film "<a href="Zombieland">Zombieland</a>", in which she features alongside <a href="Jesse%20Eisenberg">Jesse Eisenberg</a>, <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a> and <a href="Abigail%20Breslin">Abigail Breslin</a>. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a <a href="zombie%20apocalypse">zombie apocalypse</a>, in a role which "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" Chris Hewitt found to be "somewhat underwritten". In a more positive review, the critic for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" wrote: "[T]he hugely promising Stone... [is] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years." Stone's final release in 2009 was <a href="Kieran%20Mulroney">Kieran and Michelle Mulroney's</a> "<a href="Paper%20Man%20%282009%20film%29">Paper Man</a>", a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.

Stone provided the voice of an <a href="Australian%20Shepherd">Australian Shepherd</a> in "<a href="Marmaduke%20%28film%29">Marmaduke</a>" (2010), a comedy from director <a href="Tom%20Dey">Tom Dey</a>, which is based on <a href="Brad%20Anderson%20%28cartoonist%29">Brad Anderson</a>'s <a href="Marmaduke">long-running comic strip of the same name</a>. Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in "<a href="Easy%20A">Easy A</a>", a teen comedy directed by <a href="Will%20Gluck">Will Gluck</a>. Partially based on <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s 1850 historical romance novel "<a href="The%20Scarlet%20Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a>", the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually <a href="promiscuous">promiscuous</a>. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script "so different and unique from anything I'd read before", saying that it was "funny and sweet". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition. The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone's performance was considered its prime asset. Anna Smith of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" commented: "Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth." With a total box office of $75 million, the film was a commercial success. Stone was nominated for a <a href="BAFTA%20Rising%20Star%20Award">BAFTA Rising Star Award</a> and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy</a>, and won the <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Comedic%20Performance">MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance</a>.

In October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC's late-night sketch comedy "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>"; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to <a href="Lindsay%20Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>. Stone described it as "the greatest week of my life". She hosted it again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in <a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live%2040th%20Anniversary%20Special">its 40th anniversary special</a> in 2015. A brief appearance in the sex comedy "<a href="Friends%20with%20Benefits%20%28film%29">Friends with Benefits</a>" (2011) reunited her with Gluck. She followed this with a supporting role in <a href="Glenn%20Ficarra">Glenn Ficarra</a> and <a href="John%20Requa">John Requa</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Crazy%2C%20Stupid%2C%20Love">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>" (2011) alongside <a href="Steve%20Carell">Steve Carell</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a> and <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>. The film features her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling's character. Despite finding "some inevitable collapses into convention" in the film, <a href="Drew%20McWeeny">Drew McWeeny</a> of <a href="HitFix">HitFix</a> wrote that Stone "ties the whole film together". At the <a href="2012%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2012 Teen Choice Awards</a>, she won the <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award%20for%20Choice%20Movie%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Comedy">Choice Movie Actress – Comedy</a> award for her performance in the film. "Crazy, Stupid, Love" was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide with a production budget of $50 million.

Disillusioned at being <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as the "sarcastic interest of the guy", Stone co-starred with <a href="Viola%20Davis">Viola Davis</a> in <a href="Tate%20Taylor">Tate Taylor</a>'s period drama "<a href="The%20Help%20%28film%29">The Help</a>" (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on <a href="Kathryn%20Stockett">Kathryn Stockett</a>'s <a href="The%20Help">2009 novel of the same name</a> and is set in 1960s <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a>. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." She was cast as Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern dialect</a>; she also educated herself on the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, "The Help" became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for "Empire", Anna Smith thought that Stone was "well-meaning and hugely likable" despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the <a href="Women%20Film%20Critics%20Circle">Women Film Critics Circle</a> and the <a href="Broadcast%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Broadcast Film Critics Association</a>.

Stone declined a role in the action comedy film "<a href="21%20Jump%20Street%20%28film%29">21 Jump Street</a>" after signing on to <a href="Marc%20Webb">Marc Webb</a>'s 2012 film "<a href="The%20Amazing%20Spider-Man%20%282012%20film%29">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>", a <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> of <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a>'s <a href="Spider-Man%20in%20film%23Sam%20Raimi%20films">"Spider-Man" series</a>. She portrayed <a href="Gwen%20Stacy">Gwen Stacy</a>, the love interest of the <a href="Spider-Man">title character</a> (played by <a href="Andrew%20Garfield">Andrew Garfield</a>). Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously. She told "<a href="The%20Vancouver%20Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a>" that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: "My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Watson">Mary Jane</a> was his first love", adding that she was only familiar with Stacy's character from <a href="Bryce%20Dallas%20Howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>'s portrayal in "<a href="Spider-Man%203">Spider-Man 3</a>". "The Amazing Spider-Man" was a commercial success and was <a href="2012%20in%20film">the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012</a> with global revenues of $757.9 million. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" <a href="Lisa%20Schwarzbaum">Lisa Schwarzbaum</a> found Stone "irresistible", and <a href="Ian%20Freer">Ian Freer</a> of "Empire" magazine was particularly impressed with Stone's and Garfield's performances. At the annual <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Awards</a> ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress. Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, "<a href="Sleeping%20Dogs%20%28video%20game%29">Sleeping Dogs</a>", which earned her a <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Award">Spike Video Game Award</a> for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.

Stone began 2013 with a voice role in <a href="DreamWorks%20Animation">DreamWorks</a>' "<a href="The%20Croods">The Croods</a>", an animated feature nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Animated Feature</a>. This followed with an appearance in "<a href="Movie%2043">Movie 43</a>", an <a href="anthology%20film">anthology film</a> which consists of sixteen short stories—she played the title role in the segment entitled "Veronica". The actress collaborated with Ryan Gosling and <a href="Sean%20Penn">Sean Penn</a> in Ruben Fleischer's "<a href="Gangster%20Squad%20%28film%29">Gangster Squad</a>" (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> dismissed the film as "a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits", but praised her pairing with Gosling. Stone expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.

In 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in "<a href="The%20Amazing%20Spider-Man%202">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a>". In an interview with "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>", the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film's protagonist. "She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He's the muscle, she's the brains." Her performance was well received by critics; an "Empire" reviewer praised her for standing out in the film: "Stone is the <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a> of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character." The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the <a href="2015%20Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">2015 Kids' Choice Awards</a>. Later that year, Stone took on a role in <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Magic%20in%20the%20Moonlight">Magic in the Moonlight</a>", a modest commercial success. A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>, describing it as "the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect".

The <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a>-drama "<a href="Birdman%20%28film%29">Birdman</a>", from director <a href="Alejandro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu">Alejandro González Iñárritu</a>, was Stone's final film release in 2014. Co-starring <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> and <a href="Edward%20Norton">Edward Norton</a>, the film features her in the role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter. "Birdman" was critically acclaimed, and was the most successful film at the <a href="87th%20Academy%20Awards">87th Academy Awards</a>; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture. <a href="The%20Movie%20Network">The Movie Network</a> considered it one of Stone's best performances to date and <a href="Robbie%20Collin">Robbie Collin</a> of "The Daily Telegraph" was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was "like a knitting needle to the gut". She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy</a>, a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe</a>, a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Screen Actors Guild</a>, and a <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Movie%20Award">Critics' Choice Movie</a> award for Best Supporting Actress.

From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>" as <a href="Sally%20Bowles">Sally Bowles</a>, taking over the role from <a href="Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">Michelle Williams</a>. Considering it to be "the most nerve-racking thing ever", Stone told the "Entertainment Weekly" magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role. "Variety"s Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance "a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy." Both of Stone's 2015 filmsthe romantic comedy-drama "<a href="Aloha%20%282015%20film%29">Aloha</a>", and the mystery drama "<a href="Irrational%20Man%20%28film%29">Irrational Man</a>"were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics. In <a href="Cameron%20Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a>'s "Aloha", she took on the role of an air force pilot alongside <a href="Bradley%20Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>, and in the Woody Allen-directed "Irrational Man", she portrayed the romantic interest of <a href="Joaquin%20Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>'s character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for <a href="racebending">whitewashing</a> the cast, as Stone's character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood. Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy at the <a href="2015%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2015 Teen Choice Awards</a>. Stone would also in 2015 star in the <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for <a href="Win%20Butler">Win Butler's</a> single "Anna" 

During her "Cabaret" show, Stone met director <a href="Damien%20Chazelle">Damien Chazelle</a>, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama "<a href="La%20La%20Land%20%28film%29">La La Land</a>". The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, featured Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles. Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched "<a href="The%20Umbrellas%20of%20Cherbourg">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a>" and films of <a href="Fred%20Astaire%20and%20Ginger%20Rogers">Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers</a>. For the <a href="La%20La%20Land%20%28soundtrack%29">musical's soundtrack</a>, she recorded six songs. "La La Land" served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and received highly positive reviews. Besides being Stone's highest-rated film on the review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget. Writing for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> reviewed, "Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears." Stone received an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe</a> and a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">SAG</a> Award for Best Actress.

Stone's sole film release of 2017 was the sports drama "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sexes%20%282017%20film%29">Battle of the Sexes</a>", based on the 1973 <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sexes%20%28tennis%29">eponymous match</a> between tennis players <a href="Billie%20Jean%20King">Billie Jean King</a> (Stone) and <a href="Bobby%20Riggs">Bobby Riggs</a> (Steve Carell). In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, trained with a dialect coach to speak in King's accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain . The film premiered to positive reviews at the <a href="2017%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2017 Toronto International Film Festival</a>, and certain critics considered Stone's performance to be the best of her career. Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" praised her for playing against type, and credited her for being "strong" and "convincing" in the part. Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget. Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.

In 2018, Stone and <a href="Rachel%20Weisz">Rachel Weisz</a> starred as <a href="Abigail%20Masham">Abigail Masham</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Churchill%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Sarah Churchill</a>, two cousins fighting for the affection of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> (<a href="Olivia%20Colman">Olivia Colman</a>), in <a href="Yorgos%20Lanthimos">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>'s historical comedy-drama "<a href="The%20Favourite%20%28film%29">The Favourite</a>". Stone found it challenging being an American among a British cast, and had difficulty in mastering the accent. The film premiered at the <a href="75th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">75th Venice International Film Festival</a> in August. Michael Nordine of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> praised Stone for taking on a bold role after "La La Land", and termed the three leading ladies "a majestic triumvirate in a period piece that's as tragic as it is hilarious." For "The Favourite", Stone received her fifth Golden Globe nomination and third Oscar nomination. That September, she featured in and served as an executive producer for the <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> dark comedy miniseries "<a href="Maniac%20%28miniseries%29">Maniac</a>", co-starring Jonah Hill and directed by <a href="Cary%20Fukunaga">Cary Fukunaga</a>. Stone and Hill played two strangers, Annie Landsberg and Owen Milgrim, whose lives are transformed due to a mysterious pharmaceutical trial. An admirer of Fukunaga's work, Stone agreed to the project without reading the script. <a href="Lucy%20Mangan">Lucy Mangan</a> of "The Guardian" praised Stone and Hill for playing against type and for delivering career-best performances; Judy Berman of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" was similarly impressed with their growth as actors since "Superbad" and took note of the complexity in their performances. In the same year, Stone appeared alongside <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> in a music video for his song "<a href="Who%20Cares%20%28Paul%20McCartney%20song%29">Who Cares</a>".

Stone will next star in "", in the drama "Love May Fail", based on <a href="Matthew%20Quick">Matthew Quick</a>'s 2015 novel, and in a live-action spin-off of "<a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a>" titled "Cruella", directed by <a href="Craig%20Gillespie">Craig Gillespie</a>, in which she will portray <a href="Cruella%20de%20Vil">Cruella de Vil</a> (originally played by <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a> in the <a href="101%20Dalmatians%20%281996%20film%29">1996 live-action adaptation</a>). She is also set to return as the voice of Eep Crood in the sequel to "The Croods".

Stone moved from Los Angeles to <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, New York City, in 2009. In 2016, she moved back to Los Angeles. Despite frequent media coverage, the actress has refused to speak about her private life. Concerned with living a "normal" life, she has said that she finds little value in media attention. She has expressed her fondness for her profession, and has cited actress <a href="Diane%20Keaton">Diane Keaton</a> as an influence, who is (in Stone's words) "one of the most covered-up actresses of all time". She has also named actress and singer-songwriter <a href="Marion%20Cotillard">Marion Cotillard</a> as one of her inspirations.

Stone has a close relationship with her family. She says: "I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense." During the production of "The Amazing Spider-Man" in 2010, Stone dated co-star <a href="Andrew%20Garfield">Andrew Garfield</a>. The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up. The couple refused to talk about it publicly, though they made several appearances together. In 2014, on an occasion in New York, Stone and Garfield encouraged <a href="paparazzi">paparazzi</a> to visit websites which spread awareness of causes such as <a href="autism">autism</a>. In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.

According to Stone, she suffers from <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, which she discovered after having difficulty breathing while filming "Easy A". Her mother was diagnosed with <a href="triple-negative%20breast%20cancer">triple-negative breast cancer</a> and was cured in 2008. Stone and her mother celebrated by getting tattoos of birds' feet, designed by <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, a reference to <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="Blackbird%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Blackbird</a>", which is a song she and her mother love. She appeared in a <a href="Revlon">Revlon</a> campaign that promoted breast cancer awareness. In 2011, the actress featured in a collaborative video between "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%20series%29">Star Wars</a>" and <a href="Stand%20Up%20to%20Cancer">Stand Up to Cancer</a>, which aimed to raise funds for cancer research. Two years later, she attended an event by <a href="Gilda%27s%20Club">Gilda's Club</a>, an organization working for a similar purpose. From 2012 to 2014, she hosted the <a href="Entertainment%20Industry%20Foundation">Entertainment Industry Foundation</a>'s Revlon Run/Walk, which helps fight women's cancer.

Stone, alongside three other celebrities, was present at the 2012 <a href="Nickelodeon%20HALO%20Awards">Nickelodeon HALO Awards</a>, a television special that profiled five teenagers who are "Helping And Leading Others" (HALO). She attended the 2014 <a href="Earth%20Hour">Earth Hour</a>, a worldwide movement for the planet organized by the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>. In 2015, she was part of a fundraising event in support of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Fund">Motion Picture & Television Fund</a>, which helps people in the television and film industry with limited or no resources. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.

Several media publications consider Stone one of her generation's most talented actresses. Commenting on her performance in "The Help", Kirk Honeycutt of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" called her "one of our very best young actresses". She is known for starring both in high-profile, mainstream productions and in low-budget independent films. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" Daniel D'Addario describes the latter as "substantive risk" and adds that taking on a role in them provides her an opportunity to "try something new and to get credibility". Analyzing her on-screen persona, Jessica Kiang of <a href="Indiewire">Indiewire</a> noted that Stone "usually [plays] the approachable, down-to-earth, girl-next-door type, [and] in person she demonstrates many of those qualities too, along with an absolute refusal to take herself too seriously."

As her career in Hollywood films has developed, Stone has become a successful and popular actress. In 2008, she topped "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Magazine%20%28U.S.%29">Saturday Night Magazine</a>" Top 20 Rising Stars Under 30 and was included in a similar list compiled by <a href="Moviefone">Moviefone</a>. <a href="LoveFilm">LoveFilm</a> placed her on their list of 2010 Top 20 Actresses Under 30, and her performance in "Easy A" was included in "Time" Top 10 Everything of 2010. She appeared in the 2013 <a href="Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a>, a compilation of the 100 most powerful people in the world, as selected annually by "<a href="Forbes%20%28magazine%29">Forbes</a>". The magazine reported that she had earned $16 million from June 2012 to June 2013. That same year, she was ranked first in the magazine's Top 10 Best Value Stars. In 2015, "Forbes" published that she had become one of the highest-paid actresses with earnings of $6.5 million. The magazine would rank her as the world's highest-paid actress two years later with yearly earnings of $26 million. In 2017, she was featured by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" as one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a>.

Stone is considered a style iconthe media cites her hair, eyes, and husky voice as her trademarks. "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" credits the actress for her "sophisticated, perfectly put-together looks", writing that "her charisma, both on-screen and off-, has charmed many." In 2009, she featured in <a href="AskMen">AskMen's</a> Top 99 Women, "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>" <a href="FHM%27s%20100%20Sexiest%20Women%20%28UK%29">100 Sexiest Women in the World</a>, and "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" magazine's Hot 100; the latter also placed her on the list on three other occasions2010, 2011, and 2014. She continued to be featured in AskMen's annual beauty lists from 2010 to 2015, ranking among the top forty each year. In 2011, she appeared in <a href="Victoria%27s%20Secret">Victoria's Secret's</a> list of What is Sexy? as the Sexiest Actress. She was mentioned in several other media outlet lists that year, including "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine's 100 Most Beautiful Women, each of "FHM" and "<a href="FHM%20Australia">FHM Australia</a>" 100 Sexiest Women in the World, and "<a href="Men%27s%20Health">Men's Health</a>" magazine's 100 Hottest Women. She ranked sixth on "Empire" list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013. Stone was named the best dressed woman of 2012 by "Vogue" magazine and was featured in similar listings by "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour</a>" in 2013 and 2015, and "People" in 2014. In 2017, <a href="Buzznet">Buzznet</a> named her one of the world's most beautiful women.

According to the review aggregator site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and the box-office site <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, Stone's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films are "Superbad" (2007), "Zombieland" (2009), "Easy A" (2010), "Crazy, Stupid, Love" (2011), "The Help" (2011), "The Amazing Spider-Man" (2012), "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (2014), "Birdman" (2014), "La La Land" (2016), "Battle of the Sexes" (2017), and "The Favourite" (2018).

Osteochondritis dissecans

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) is a <a href="joint">joint</a> disorder in which cracks form in the <a href="articular%20cartilage">articular cartilage</a> and the underlying <a href="subchondral%20bone">subchondral bone</a>. OCD usually causes pain and <a href="Swelling%20%28medical%29">swelling</a> of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. <a href="Physical%20examination">Physical examination</a> typically reveals an <a href="Joint%20effusion">effusion</a>, tenderness, and a <a href="crepitus">crackling sound with joint movement</a>.
OCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called <a href="avascular%20necrosis">avascular necrosis</a>. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (<a href="dissection">dissection</a>) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by <a href="Radiography">X-rays</a>, <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) or <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) scans.
Non-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, <a href="Stem%20cell%20transplantation%20for%20articular%20cartilage%20repair">stem cell transplantation</a>, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of <a href="Lying%20%28position%29">immobilization</a> and <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a>. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, <a href="isometric%20exercise">isometric exercise</a>s, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.
OCD occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active <a href="adolescent">adolescent</a>s. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. <a href="Franz%20K%C3%B6nig%20%28surgeon%29">Franz König</a> coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of the bone–<a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, <a href="osteonecrosis">osteonecrosis</a>, accessory ossification center, <a href="osteochondrosis">osteochondrosis</a>, and hereditary epiphyseal <a href="dysplasia">dysplasia</a>. Some authors have used the terms "osteochondrosis dissecans" and "osteochondral fragments" as <a href="synonym">synonym</a>s for OCD.
In osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice. OCD is a type of <a href="osteochondrosis">osteochondrosis</a> in which a <a href="lesion">lesion</a> has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.

People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I; however, the onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. <a href="Non-specific%20symptom">Non-specific symptom</a>s, caused by similar injuries such as <a href="sprain">sprain</a>s and <a href="strain%20%28injury%29">strains</a>, can delay a definitive diagnosis.

Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and <a href="crepitus">crepitus</a>. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty <a href="hemarthrosis">hemarthrosis</a>. Although there is no significant <a href="pathologic">pathologic</a> gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid <a href="tibia">tibia</a>l spine impingement on the <a href="lateral%20%28anatomy%29">lateral</a> aspect of the <a href="Medial%20condyle%20of%20femur">medial condyle of the femur</a>.

Despite much research, the <a href="etiology">causes</a> remain unclear but include repetitive <a href="physical%20trauma">physical trauma</a>, <a href="ischemia">ischemia</a> (restriction of blood flow), <a href="hereditary">hereditary</a> and <a href="endocrine">endocrine</a> factors, <a href="avascular%20necrosis">avascular necrosis</a> (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus, and problems of <a href="ossification">bone formation</a>. Although the name "osteochondritis" implies <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, the lack of inflammatory cells in <a href="Histology">histological</a> examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive <a href="microtrauma">microtrauma</a>, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth.

<a href="Physical%20trauma">Trauma</a>, rather than avascular necrosis, is thought to cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma is thought to be the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be <a href="endogenous">endogenous</a>, <a href="exogenous">exogenous</a> or both. The incidence of <a href="repetitive%20strain%20injury">repetitive strain injury</a> in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).

Recent case reports suggest that some people may be genetically predisposed to OCD. Families with OCD may have mutations in the <a href="aggrecan">aggrecan</a> gene. Studies in horses have implicated specific genetic defects.

Osteochondritis dissecans differs from "wear and tear" degenerative <a href="osteoarthritis">arthritis</a>, which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD is a problem of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.

OCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially (or fully) separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (<a href="osteonecrosis">osteonecrosis</a>) and decalcification of the <a href="Trabecular%20bone">trabecular bone matrix</a>. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the <a href="joint">joint</a> stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.

In skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the <a href="epiphyseal%20plate">epiphyseal bone</a> is good, supporting both <a href="osteogenesis">osteogenesis</a> and <a href="chondrogenesis">chondrogenesis</a>. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a> occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both <a href="osteocytes">osteocytes</a> and <a href="chondrocytes">chondrocytes</a>. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral <a href="avascular%20necrosis">avascular necrosis</a> and consequently OCD.

Four minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include <a href="revascularization">revascularization</a> and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive <a href="arthritis">arthritic</a> deterioration.

To diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a> or <a href="MRI%20scan">MRI scan</a> can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a <a href="nuclear%20medicine">nuclear medicine</a> <a href="bone%20scan">bone scan</a> is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.

Physical examination often begins with examination of the patient's <a href="Gait%20%28human%29">gait</a>. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid <a href="tibia">tibia</a>l spine impingement on the <a href="lateral%20%28anatomy%29">lateral</a> aspect of the <a href="Medial%20condyle%20of%20femur">medial condyle of the femur</a>.

Next, the examining physician may check for weakness of the <a href="quadriceps">quadriceps</a>. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The <a href="Wilson%20test">Wilson test</a> is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the <a href="Lower%20extremity%20of%20femur">femoral condyle</a>. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of <a href="flexion">flexion</a> and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.

Physical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, <a href="crepitus">crepitus</a>, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, <a href="Swelling%20%28medical%29">swelling</a>, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are <a href="extrinsic">extrinsic</a> and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.

X-rays show lucency of the <a href="ossification">ossification</a> front in juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of <a href="Osteosclerosis">osteosclerotic</a> bone with a <a href="radiodensity">radiolucent</a> line between the osteochondral defect and the <a href="epiphysis">epiphysis</a>. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee <a href="flexion">flexion</a> used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.

<a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage <a href="edema">edema</a> in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the <a href="articular%20cartilage">articular cartilage</a> and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, <a href="Articular%20cartilage%20damage">articular</a> surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and <a href="arthroscopy">arthroscopy</a> have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.

<a href="Computed%20tomography">Computed tomography</a> (CT) scans and <a href="Technetium-99m">Technetium-99m</a> <a href="bone%20scan">bone scan</a>s are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of <a href="osseous">osseous</a> uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.
OCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages.
There are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined <a href="Arthroscope">arthroscopically</a>. However, both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.

While the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article. Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed <a href="synovial%20fluid">synovial fluid</a> between the fragment and bone.

Treatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing; immobilization; <a href="Cryotherapy%20%28chamber%20therapy%29">cryotherapy</a>; <a href="non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">anti-inflammatory medication</a>; drilling of subchondral bone; <a href="Microfracture%20surgery">microfracture</a>; removal or reattachment of loose bodies; mosaicplasty and osteoarticular transfer system (OATS) procedures. The primary goals of treatment are:
The articular cartilage's capacity for repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson Stage II, III).

Candidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.

Once candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in <a href="Extension%20%28kinesiology%29">extension</a> to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased <a href="radiodensity">radiodensity</a> in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.

The choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> cartilage in <a href="glycosaminoglycan">glycosaminoglycan</a> concentration, <a href="Histology">histological</a>, and <a href="Immunohistochemistry">immunohistochemical</a> appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.

If non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. <a href="Arthroscopic">Arthroscopic</a> drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.

Pins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions. Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws may be used to secure these types of lesions.

The three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling, abrasion, and microfracturing.

In 1946, Magnusson established the use of stem cells from <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> with the first surgical <a href="debridement">debridement</a> of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into <a href="fibrocartilage">fibrocartilage</a> and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal <a href="hyaline%20cartilage">hyaline cartilage</a> and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this can be attributed to the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.

In attempts to address the weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques have been designed to fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is <a href="autologous">autologous</a> <a href="chondrocyte">chondrocyte</a> implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated <a href="femur">femoral</a> defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the <a href="Intercondylar%20fossa%20of%20femur">intercondylar notch</a> of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.

Similar to OATS, arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.

Some methods of fixation for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and <a href="Timothy%20Herbert">Herbert screws</a> or pins made of stainless steel or materials that can be absorbed by the body. If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.

Continuous passive motion (CPM) has been used to improve healing of the articular surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.

A rehabilitation program often involves protection of the compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative <a href="analgesics">analgesics</a>, namely a mix of <a href="opioids">opioids</a> and <a href="NSAIDs">NSAIDs</a>, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other <a href="isometric%20exercise">isometric exercise</a>s are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a> program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.

The prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.

The prognosis is good for stable lesions (stage I and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (<a href="Mesenchymal%20stem%20cell">stem cells</a>) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stage III and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.

OCD is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated <a href="incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W "et al." found OCD to be the cause of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.

While OCD may affect any joint, the knee—specifically the <a href="Medial%20condyle%20of%20femur">medial femoral condyle</a> in 75–85% of knee cases—tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the <a href="capitulum%20of%20the%20humerus">capitulum of the humerus</a>) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the <a href="Talus%20bone">talar dome</a> of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the <a href="patella">patella</a>, <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a>, the femoral head, and the <a href="glenoid">glenoid</a> of the scapula.

The condition was initially described by <a href="Alexander%20Monro%20%28primus%29">Alexander Monro (primus)</a> in 1738.
In 1870, <a href="James%20Paget">James Paget</a> described the disease process for the first time, but it was not until 1887 that <a href="Franz%20K%C3%B6nig%20%28surgeon%29">Franz König</a> published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint. In his paper, König concluded that:
König named the disease "osteochondritis dissecans", describing it as a subchondral inflammatory process of the knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint. On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the <a href="Talus%20bone">talus</a>, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and <a href="Metatarsophalangeal%20articulations">metatarsophalangeal joints</a>.


OCD also is found in animals, and is of particular concern in horses, as there may be a hereditary component in some <a href="horse%20breed">horse breed</a>s. Feeding for forced growth and <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the <a href="German%20Shepherd%20Dog">German Shepherd</a>—where it is a common primary cause of <a href="elbow%20dysplasia">elbow dysplasia</a> in medium-large breeds.

In animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral <a href="ossification">ossification</a>. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.

According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and <a href="Hock%20%28zoology%29">tarsus</a>.

The problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, <a href="arthroscopy">arthroscopy</a>, or <a href="MRI">MRI</a> scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.

Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as <a href="Hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">hip dysplasia</a>.

1991 Perfect Storm

The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as The No-Name Storm (especially in the years immediately after it took place) and the Halloween Gale/Storm, was a <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a> that absorbed <a href="Hurricane%20Grace%20%281991%29">Hurricane Grace</a> and ultimately evolved back into a small unnamed <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a> late in its life cycle. The initial <a href="low%20pressure%20area">area of low pressure</a> developed off <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a> on October 29. Forced southward by a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a> before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> and turned toward the northeast. On November 1, the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane, with peak sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the precursor extratropical storm. It later received the name "the Perfect Storm" (playing off the <a href="perfect%20storm">common expression</a>) after a conversation between Boston <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> forecaster <a href="Robert%20Case">Robert Case</a> and author <a href="Sebastian%20Junger">Sebastian Junger</a>. The system was the twelfth and final tropical cyclone, the eighth tropical storm, and fourth hurricane in the <a href="1991%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1991 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Damage from the storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD) and the death toll was thirteen. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the <a href="Bush%20compound">vacation home</a> of then-<a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, the damage was worse than that caused by <a href="Hurricane%20Bob">Hurricane Bob</a> two months earlier. 
Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A <a href="Weather%20buoy">buoy</a> off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the fishing vessel "<a href="Andrea%20Gail">Andrea Gail</a>" sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28book%29">book</a>, and later <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28film%29">movie</a>, "The Perfect Storm". Off the shore of New York's <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.

The Perfect Storm originated from a <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> that exited the east coast of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> extended from the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a>, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.
While situated about south of <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of up to . The nor'easter reached peak intensity at approximately 12:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on October 30 with its lowest pressure of 972 <a href="millibar">millibar</a>s. The interaction between the extratropical storm and the high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient, which created large waves and strong winds. Between the southern New England coast and the storm's center, the gradient was . A buoy located south of <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax</a> reported a wave height of on October 30. This became the highest recorded wave height on the <a href="Scotian%20Shelf">Scotian Shelf</a>, which is the oceanic <a href="Continental%20shelf">shelf</a> off the coast of Nova Scotia. East of Cape Cod, a NOAA buoy located at reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to , and a <a href="significant%20wave%20height">significant wave height</a> (average height of the highest one-third of all waves) of around 15:00 UTC on October 30. Another buoy, located at , reported maximum sustained winds of with gusts to and a significant wave height of near 00:00 UTC on October 31.

Upon peaking in intensity, the nor'easter turned southward and gradually weakened; by November 1, its pressure had risen to . The low moved over warm waters of the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, where <a href="rainband">bands</a> of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> around the center began to organize. Around this time, the system attained <a href="subtropical%20storm">subtropical characteristics</a>. On November 1, while the storm was moving in a counter-clockwise loop, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> had been identified at the center of the larger low. (Although these conditions are rare, <a href="Hurricane%20Karl%20%281980%29">Hurricane Karl</a> during 1980 formed within a larger non-tropical weather system.)

By around 14:00 UTC on November 1, an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> was forming, and the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">maximum sustained winds</a> of ; these estimates, combined with reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit flight into the storm and confirmation that a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Mechanics">warm-core</a> center was present, indicated that the system had become a Category 1 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>. The hurricane accelerated toward the northeast and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm. It made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia, at 14:00 UTC on November 2, with sustained winds of . While the storm was approaching the coast, weather radars depicted curved rainbands on the western side of the system. After crossing over <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>, the storm fully dissipated late on November 2.

For several days, <a href="Numerical%20weather%20prediction">weather models</a> forecast the development of a significant storm off New England. However, the models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions, which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning. In addition, a post-storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along the coast. On October 27, the <a href="Ocean%20Prediction%20Center">Ocean Prediction Center</a> noted that a "dangerous storm" would form within 36 hours, with its wording emphasizing the unusual nature of the storm. The <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> likewise issued warnings for the potential storm, providing information to emergency service offices as well as the media. The public however was skeptical and did not recognize the threat. The timely warnings ultimately lowered the death toll; whereas the Perfect Storm caused 13 deaths, the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States%20blizzard%20of%201978">blizzard of 1978</a> killed 99 people, and the <a href="1938%20New%20England%20hurricane">1938 New England hurricane</a> killed 564 people.

From Massachusetts to Maine, thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter. A state of emergency was declared for nine counties in Massachusetts, including <a href="Suffolk%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Suffolk County</a>, as well as two in Maine. In North Carolina, the National Weather Service offices in <a href="Hatteras%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hatteras</a> and <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh</a> first issued a heavy surf advisory on October 27, more than eight hours before the first reports of high waves. That same day, a <a href="coastal%20flood%20watch">coastal flood watch</a> and later a warning was issued, along with a gale warning. The Hatteras NWS office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements, as well as media reports explaining the threat from the wind and waves, and a state of emergency was declared for <a href="Dare%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Dare County, North Carolina</a>. The warnings and lead times in the region were described as "very good".

In Canada, the threat from the storm prompted the cancellation of ferry service from <a href="Bar%20Harbor%2C%20Maine">Bar Harbor, Maine</a>, to <a href="Yarmouth%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Yarmouth, Nova Scotia</a>, as well as from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island and between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

In its <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20report">tropical cyclone report</a> on the hurricane, the National Hurricane Center only referred to the system as "Unnamed Hurricane". The Natural Disaster Survey Report called the storm "The Halloween Nor'easter of 1991". The "<a href="perfect%20storm">perfect storm</a>" moniker was coined by author and journalist <a href="Sebastian%20Junger">Sebastian Junger</a> after a conversation with NWS Boston Deputy <a href="Meteorologist">Meteorologist</a> <a href="Robert%20Case">Robert Case</a> in which Case described the convergence of weather conditions as being "perfect" for the formation of such a storm. Other National Weather Service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical NHC advisories. The OPC posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its "High Seas Forecasts". The National Weather Service State Forecast Office in Boston issued "Offshore Marine Forecasts" for the storm. Local NWS offices along the East coast covered the storm in their "Coastal Waters Forecasts".

Beginning in 1950, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the <a href="1991%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1991 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Had the system been named instead, it would have received the name "Henri", which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.

The Halloween Storm of 1991 left significant damage along the east coast of the United States, primarily in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and southern <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD). Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves, causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine. The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports. In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees. Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths, including six on board "<a href="Andrea%20Gail">Andrea Gail</a>", a swordfishing boat. The vessel departed <a href="Gloucester%2C%20Massachusetts">Gloucester, Massachusetts</a>, for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas in the middle of the storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28, about northeast of <a href="Sable%20Island">Sable Island</a>. "Andrea Gail" sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for <a href="Sebastian%20Junger">Sebastian Junger</a>'s best-selling non-fiction book <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28book%29">"The Perfect Storm"</a> (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as <a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28film%29">"The Perfect Storm"</a> starring <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>.
Despite the storm's severity, it was neither the costliest nor the strongest to affect the northeastern United States. It was weakening as it made its closest approach to land, and the highest tides occurred during the <a href="neap%20tide">neap tide</a>, which is the time when tide ranges are minimal. The worst of the storm effects stayed offshore. A buoy northeast of <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>, which was west of "Andrea Gail" last known position, recorded a rise in wave height in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still rapidly intensifying. Two buoys near the Massachusetts coast observed record wave heights, and one observed a record wind report. The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> rescued 25 people at sea at the height of the storm, including 13 people from <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>. A New York Air National Guard helicopter of the 106th Air Rescue Wing ditched during the storm, south of <a href="Montauk%2C%20New%20York">Montauk, New York</a>, after it was unable to refuel in flight and ran out of fuel. After the helicopter had attempted a rescue in the midst of the storm, an 84-person crew on the Coast Guard Cutter "<a href="USCGC%20Tamaroa%20%28WMEC-166%29">Tamaroa</a>" arrived and rescued four members of the crew of five after six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots Dave Ruvola and Graham Bushor, flight engineer Jim Miolli, and pararescue jumper John Spillane. The fifth member, pararescue jumper Rick Smith, was never found. They were all featured on the show I Shouldn't be Alive.

Following the storm's damage, President George H. W. Bush declared five <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Maine">counties in Maine</a>, seven <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Massachusetts">counties in Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="Rockingham%20County%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Rockingham County, New Hampshire</a> to be disaster areas. The declaration allowed for the affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans. New Jersey governor <a href="Jim%20Florio">Jim Florio</a> requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters, such as <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a>, Hurricane Bob, and the <a href="1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">1989 Loma Prieta earthquake</a>. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families.

Along the Massachusetts coastline, the storm produced wave heights on top of a high tide. In <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, the highest tide was , which was only lower than the record from the blizzard of 1978. High waves on top of the storm tide reached about . The storm produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Massachusetts, peaking at . Coastal floods closed several roads, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. In addition to the high tides, the storm produced strong winds; <a href="Chatham%2C%20Massachusetts">Chatham</a> recorded a gust of . Damage was worst from <a href="Cape%20Ann">Cape Ann</a> in northeastern Massachusetts to Nantucket, with over 100 homes destroyed or severely damaged at <a href="Marshfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Marshfield</a>, <a href="North%20Beach%2C%20Massachusetts">North Beach</a>, and <a href="Brant%20Point%20Light">Brant Point</a>. There were two injuries in the state, although there were no fatalities. Across Massachusetts, damage totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Elsewhere in New England, waves up to reached as far north as Maine, along with tides that were above normal. Significant flooding was reported in that state, along with high winds that left areas without power. A total of 49 houses were severely damaged, 2 were destroyed, and overall more than 100 were affected. In <a href="Kennebunkport%2C%20Maine">Kennebunkport</a>, the storm blew out windows and flooded the vacation home of then-President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. The home sustained significant damage to its first floor. In <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland</a>, tides were above normal, among the ten highest tides since record-keeping began in 1914. Along the coast, damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months prior. Across Maine, the storm left $7.9 million (1991 USD) in damage, mostly in <a href="York%20County%2C%20Maine">York County</a>. More than half of the damage total was from property damage, with the remainder to transportation, seawalls, and public facilities. Although there were no deaths, there were two injuries in the state. In neighboring New Hampshire, coastal flooding affected several towns, destroying two homes. The storm destroyed three boats and damaged a lighthouse. High waves destroyed or swept away over 50,000 lobster traps, representing $2 million in losses (1991 USD). Damage was estimated at $5.6 million (1991 USD). Further west, high winds and coastal flooding lashed the Rhode Island and Connecticut coasts, killing a man in <a href="Narragansett%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Narragansett, Rhode Island</a>. Winds reached in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, causing power outages.

Off the coast of Atlantic Canada, the storm produced very high waves, flooding a ship near <a href="Sable%20Island">Sable Island</a> and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near <a href="Tiverton%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Tiverton, Nova Scotia</a>, as well as nine boats in <a href="Torbay%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador</a>. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30 mm), and 20,000 people in <a href="Pictou%20County%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Pictou County</a> were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68 mph (110 km/h) near <a href="St.%20Lawrence%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. Lawrence</a>. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in <a href="Grand%20Falls-Windsor">Grand Falls-Windsor</a> due to slick roads. Prior to the storm's formation, there was a record 4.4 in (116 mm) of snowfall across Newfoundland. The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other than these traffic accidents.

In New York and northern New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the <a href="1944%20Great%20Atlantic%20hurricane">1944 Great Atlantic hurricane</a>. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded the beach at <a href="Coney%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Coney Island</a>. In <a href="Sea%20Bright%2C%20New%20Jersey">Sea Bright, New Jersey</a>, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson</a>, <a href="Passaic%20River">Passaic</a>, and <a href="Hackensack%20River">Hackensack</a> rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 <a href="cubic%20yard">cubic yard</a>s (382,000 cubic meters) lost in <a href="Avalon%2C%20New%20Jersey">Avalon</a>, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in <a href="Cape%20May%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cape May</a>. The presence of a <a href="dune">dune</a> system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a> Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like <a href="Fair%20Harbor%2C%20New%20York">Fair Harbor</a>. Following the storm, there was a <a href="moratorium%20%28law%29">moratorium</a> on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> and <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach</a>, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in <a href="Sandbridge%20Beach">Sandbridge Beach</a>, Virginia. Tides in <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the <a href="Ash%20Wednesday%20Storm%20of%201962">Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962</a>.

In North Carolina along the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a>, high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and waves in the town of <a href="Duck%2C%20North%20Carolina">Duck</a>. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a> through the northern portions of <a href="Currituck%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Currituck County</a>. Flooding was first reported on October 28, when the ocean covered a portion of <a href="North%20Carolina%20Highway%2012">North Carolina Highway 12</a> north of <a href="Rodanthe%2C%20North%20Carolina">Rodanthe</a>; the route is the primary thoroughfare in the Outer Banks. <a href="Nags%20Head%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nags Head</a>, <a href="Kitty%20Hawk%2C%20North%20Carolina">Kitty Hawk</a>, and <a href="Kill%20Devil%20Hills%2C%20North%20Carolina">Kill Devil Hills</a> had large portions covered with water for several blocks away from the beach. The resultant flooding damaged 525 houses and 28 businesses and destroyed two motels and a few homes. Damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1991 USD). Farther south, the storm left 14 people injured in Florida. There was minor beach erosion and flooding, which damaged two houses and destroyed the pier at <a href="Lake%20Worth%2C%20Florida">Lake Worth</a>. In some locations, beaches gained additional sand from the wave action. Two people went missing off <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona Beach</a> after their boat lost power. High waves destroyed a portion of <a href="Florida%20State%20Road%20A1A">State Road A1A</a>. Damage in the state was estimated at $3 million (1991 USD). High waves also affected Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, waves of affected the island's north coast, which prompted 32 people to seek shelter. The waves swept a person off a large rock to his death.

George Robey

Sir George Edward Wade, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (20 September 1869 – 29 November 1954), known professionally as George Robey, was an English comedian, singer and actor in musical theatre, who became known as one of the greatest <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a comedian, he mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the <a href="pantomime%20dame">dame</a> roles. He scored notable successes in musical <a href="revue">revue</a>s during and after the First World War, particularly with the song "<a href="If%20You%20Were%20the%20Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)</a>", which he performed with <a href="Violet%20Loraine">Violet Loraine</a> in the revue "<a href="The%20Bing%20Boys%20Are%20Here">The Bing Boys Are Here</a>" (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.

Born in London, Robey came from a middle-class family. After schooling in England and Germany, and a series of office jobs, he made his debut on the London stage, at the age of 21, as the <a href="straight%20man">straight man</a> to a comic hypnotist. Robey soon developed his own act and appeared at the <a href="Oxford%20Music%20Hall">Oxford Music Hall</a> in 1890, where he earned favourable notices singing "The Simple Pimple" and "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". In 1892, he appeared in his first pantomime, "Whittington Up-to-date" in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, which brought him to a wider audience. More provincial engagements followed in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, and he became a mainstay of the popular Christmas pantomime scene.

Robey's music hall act matured in the first decade of the 1900s, and he undertook a number of foreign tours. He starred in the <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> in 1912 and regularly entertained before aristocracy. He was an avid sportsman, playing <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="Association%20football">football</a> at a semi-professional level. During the First World War, in addition to his performances in revues, he raised money for many war charities and was appointed a CBE in 1919. From 1918, he created sketches based on his Prime Minister of Mirth character and used a costume he had designed in the 1890s as a basis for the character's attire. He made a successful transition from music hall to <a href="variety%20show">variety show</a>s and starred in the revue "Round in Fifty" in 1922, which earned him still wider notice. With the exception of his performances in revue and pantomime, he appeared as his Prime Minister of Mirth character in all the other entertainment media including variety, music hall and radio.

In 1913 Robey made his film debut, but he had only modest success in the medium. He continued to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in "Helen!", his first straight theatre role. His appearance brought him to the attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>" in 1935, a role that he later repeated in <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s 1944 film, "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>". During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was <a href="knighthood">knighted</a> a few months before his death in 1954.

Robey was born at 334 Kennington Road, <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, London. His father, Charles Wade, was a civil engineer who spent much of his career on <a href="tram">tram</a>line design and construction. Robey's mother, Elizabeth Mary Wade Keene, was a housewife; he also had two sisters. His paternal ancestors originated from <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>; his uncle, George Wade, married into aristocracy in 1848, a link which provided a proud topic of conversation for future generations of the Wade family. When Robey was five, his father moved the family to <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a>, where he helped in the construction of the <a href="Mersey%20Railway">Mersey Railway</a>. Robey began his schooling in nearby <a href="Hoylake">Hoylake</a> at a <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a>. Three years later the family moved back to London, near the border between <a href="Camberwell">Camberwell</a> and <a href="Peckham">Peckham</a>. At around this time, trams were being introduced to the area, providing Charles Wade with a regular, well-paid job.

To fulfil an offer of work, Charles Wade moved the family to Germany in 1880, and Robey attended a school in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. He devoted his leisure hours to visiting the city's museums, art galleries and opera houses and gained a reasonable fluency in German by the time he was 12. He enjoyed life in the country and was impressed with the many operatic productions held in the city and with the Germans' high regard for the arts. When he was 14, his father allowed him to move in with a clergyman's family in the German countryside, which he used as a base while studying science at <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig University</a>. To earn money, he taught English to his landlord's children and minded them while their parents were at work. Having successfully enrolled at the university, he studied art and music and stayed with the family for a further 18 months so he could complete his studies before returning to England in 1885. He later claimed, apparently untruthfully, to have studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>.

At the age of 18 Robey travelled to <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, where he worked in a civil engineer's office. It was here that he became interested in a career on the stage and often dreamed of starring in his own circus. He learned to play the <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and became a skilled performer on the instrument. This drew interest from a group of local musicians and, together with a friend from the group who played the guitar, Robey travelled the local area in search of engagements. Soon afterwards, they were hired to play at a charity concert at the local church, <a href="Church%20of%20SS%20Mary%20and%20Ambrose%2C%20Edgbaston">St Mary and St Ambrose</a> in <a href="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a>, a performance that led to more local bookings. For the next appearance, Robey performed an impromptu version of "<a href="Killaloe%20March">Killaloo</a>", a comic ditty taken from the <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesque</a> "<a href="Miss%20Esmeralda">Miss Esmeralda</a>". The positive response from the audience encouraged him to give up playing the mandolin to concentrate instead on singing comic songs.

By 1890 Robey had become homesick, and so he returned to South London, where he took employment in a civil engineering company. He also joined a local branch of <a href="the%20Thirteen%20Club">the Thirteen Club</a>, whose members, many of whom were amateur musicians, performed in small venues across London. Hearing of his talent, the founder of the club, W. H. Branch, invited Robey to appear at Anderton's Hotel in <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a>, where he performed the popular new comic song "Where Did You Get That Hat?". Robey's performance secured him a number of private engagements for which he was paid a <a href="guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a> a night. By the early months of 1891, Robey was much in demand, and he decided to change his stage name. He swapped "Wade" for "Robey" after working for a company in Birmingham that bore the latter name. It was at around this time that he met E. W. Rogers, an established <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> composer who wrote songs for <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> and <a href="Jenny%20Hill%20%28music%20hall%20performer%29">Jenny Hill</a>. For Robey, Rogers wrote three songs: "My Hat's a Brown 'Un", "The Simple Pimple" and "It Suddenly Dawned Upon Me".

In 1891 Robey visited the <a href="Royal%20Aquarium">Royal Aquarium</a> in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> where he watched "Professor Kennedy", a <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> <a href="mesmerist">mesmerist</a> from America. After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his dressing room and offered himself as the stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be "mesmerised" into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, and as a result he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the <a href="Oxford%20Music%20Hall">Oxford Music Hall</a>, where he performed "The Simple Pimple" and "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and "The Stage" called him a "comedian with a pretty sense of humour [who] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success". In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a>, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he "stole the notices from experienced troupers".

That summer, Robey conducted a music hall tour of the English provinces which began in <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham</a> and took him to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, at a venue owned by the mother of the influential London impresario <a href="Oswald%20Stoll">Oswald Stoll</a>. Through this engagement Robey met Stoll, and the two became lifelong friends. In early December, Robey appeared in five music halls a night, including <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Music%20Hall">Gatti's Under the Arches</a>, the <a href="Tivoli%20Music%20Hall%20%28London%29">Tivoli Music Hall</a> and the <a href="London%20Pavilion">London Pavilion</a>. In mid-December, he travelled to <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, where he appeared in his first Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>, "Whittington Up-to-Date". Pantomime would become a lucrative and regular source of employment for the comedian. Cotes calls Robey's festive performances the "cornerstone of his comic art", and the source of "some of his greatest successes".

During the 1890s Robey created a number of music hall characters centred on everyday life. Among them were "The Chinese Laundryman" and "Clarence, the Last of the Dandies". As Clarence, Robey dressed in a top hat and frock coat and carried a <a href="malacca%20cane">malacca cane</a>, the garb of a stereotypical Victorian gentleman. For his <a href="travesti%20%28theatre%29">drag</a> pieces, the comedian established "The Lady Dresser", a female tailor who was desperate to out-dress her high class customers, and "Daisy Dillwater, the District Nurse" who arrived on stage with a bicycle to share light-hearted scandal and gossip with the audience before hurriedly cycling off.

With Robey's popularity came an eagerness to differentiate himself from his music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened from the neck down with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled <a href="Top%20hat">top-hat</a>. He applied thick white <a href="face%20paint">face paint</a> and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including <a href="Sax%20Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a> and <a href="Bennett%20Scott">Bennett Scott</a>. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare."

At the start of 1894, Robey travelled to Manchester to participate in the pantomime "Jack and Jill", where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in "Jack and Jill" until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.
In the final months of 1894, Robey returned to London to honour a contract for <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a> at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred in a series of stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> and <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington</a>", for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress <a href="Ada%20Reeve">Ada Reeve</a> felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian <a href="Barry%20Lupino">Barry Lupino</a> was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.

On 29 April 1898, Robey married his first wife, the Australian-born musical theatre actress Ethel Hayden, at <a href="St%20Clement%20Danes">St Clement Danes</a> church in the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand, London</a>. The congregation was made up of various theatrical colleagues; J. Pitt Hardacre was his best man, and composer <a href="Leslie%20Stuart">Leslie Stuart</a> was the organist. Robey and Ethel resided briefly in Circus Road, <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, until the birth of their first child <a href="Edward%20Robey">Edward</a> in 1900. They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in <a href="Swiss%20Cottage">Swiss Cottage</a>, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>. Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.
By the start of the new century, Robey was a big name in pantomime, and he was able to choose his roles. Pantomime enjoyed wide popularity until the 1890s, but by the time Robey had reached his peak, interest in it was on the wane. A type of character he particularly enjoyed taking on was the <a href="pantomime%20dame">pantomime dame</a>, which historically was played by comedians from the music hall. Robey was inspired by the older comedians <a href="Herbert%20Campbell">Herbert Campbell</a> and <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>, and, although post-dating them, he rivalled their eccentricity and popularity, earning the festive entertainment a new audience. In his 1972 biography of Robey, <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> thought that the comedian was "at his fullest as a pantomime Dame".

In 1902 Robey created the character "The Prehistoric Man". He dressed as a caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government "slapping another pound of rock on his taxes". The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations. That year he released "The Prehistoric Man" and "Not That I Wish to Say Anything" on <a href="Gramophone%20record">shellac</a> discs using the early <a href="Gramophone%20record%23%26quot%3BAcoustical%26quot%3B%20recording">acoustic recording</a> process.

Robey signed a six-year contract in June 1904 to appear annually at, among other venues, the Oxford Music Hall in London, for a fee of £120 a week. The contract also required him to perform during the spring and autumn seasons between 1910 and 1912. Robey disputed this part of the contract and stated that he agreed to this only as a personal favour to the music hall manager George Adney Payne and that it should have become void on Payne's death in 1907. The management of the Oxford counter-claimed and forbade Robey from appearing in any other music hall during this period. The matter went to court, where the judge found in Robey's favour.

Robey was engaged to play the title role in the 1905 pantomime "Queen of Hearts". The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day." Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over the next few years he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, "What Are You Looking at Me For?" and "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.

Off-stage, Robey led an active lifestyle and was a keen amateur sportsman. He was proud of his healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into his fifties. Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>. In September 1904, while appearing in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, he was asked by the cricketer <a href="Harry%20Wrathall">Harry Wrathall</a> to take part in a charity cricket match at the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a>. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City A.F.C.</a>, who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> as an <a href="inside%20right">inside right</a>.
By 1903 Robey was playing at a semi-professional level. He was signed as an inside forward by Millwall Football Club and scored many goals for them. He also displayed a good level of ability in <a href="vigoro">vigoro</a>, an Australian sport derived from both cricket and baseball which was short-lived in England. Two years later he became a member of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> and played in minor games for them for many years. He gained a reputation at the club for his comic antics on the field, such as raising his eyebrows at the approaching bowler in an attempt to distract him. The writer Neville Cardus was complimentary about Robey's cricket prowess and called him "an elegant player" whose performances on the cricket field were as entertaining as they were on the stage. Although a versatile player, Robey thought of himself as a "medium-paced, right-handed bowler".

Robey was asked to help organise a charity football match in 1907 by friends of the Scottish football trainer <a href="James%20Miller%20%28footballer%29">James Miller</a>, who had died the previous year. Robey compiled a team of amateur footballers from the theatrical profession and met Miller's former team Chelsea Football Club at their home ground. The match raised considerable proceeds for Miller's widow. Robey was proud of the match and joked: "I just wanted to make sure that Chelsea stay in the first division."

In his spare time, Robey made violins, a hobby that he first took up during his years in Dresden. He became a skilled craftsman of the instrument, although he never intended for them to be played in public. Speaking in the 1960s, the violinist and composer <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a>, who played one of Robey's violins for a public performance during that decade, called the comedian's finished instrument "very professional". He was intrigued by the idea that a man as famous as Robey could produce such a "beautifully finished" instrument, unbeknown to the public. Robey was also an artist, and some of his pen and ink self-caricatures are kept at the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a>, London.

Robey's first high-profile invitation came in the first decade of the 1900s from <a href="Hugh%20Lowther%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Lonsdale">Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale</a>, who hired him as entertainment for a party he was hosting at <a href="Carlton%20House%20Terrace">Carlton House Terrace</a> in Westminster. Soon afterwards, the comedian appeared for the first time before royalty when <a href="Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a> had Robey hired for several private functions. Robey performed a series of songs and monologues and introduced the "Mayor of Mudcumdyke", all of which was met with much praise and admiration from the royal watchers. He was later hired by Edward's son, <a href="George%20V">the Prince of Wales</a> (the future King George V), who arranged a performance at Carlton House Terrace for his friend <a href="George%20Curzon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lord Curzon</a>.

In July 1912, at the invitation of the impresario Oswald Stoll, Robey took part for the first time in the <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a>, to which Cotes attributes "one of the prime factors in his continuing popularity". King George V and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> were "delighted" with Robey's comic sketch, in which he performed the "Mayor of Mudcumdyke" in public for the first time. Robey found the royal show to be a less daunting experience than the numerous private command performances that he gave during his career.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Robey wished to enlist in the army but, now in his 40s, he was too old for active service. Instead, he volunteered for the <a href="Special%20Constabulary">Special Constabulary</a> and raised money for charity through his performances as a comedian. It was not uncommon for him to finish at the theatre at 1:00 am and then to patrol as a special constable until 6:00 am, where he would frequently help out during <a href="Zeppelin">zeppelin raids</a>. He combined his civilian duties with work for a volunteer motor transport unit towards the end of the war, in which he served as a lieutenant. He committed three nights a week to the corps while organising performances during the day to benefit war charities. Robey was a strong supporter of the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> and thought that they were often overlooked when it came to charitable donations. He raised £22,000 at a benefit held at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a>, which he donated in the navy's favour.

Robey's first experience in cinema was in 1913, with two early sound film shorts: "And Very Nice Too" and "Good Queen Bess", made in the <a href="List%20of%20film%20sound%20systems">Kinoplasticon</a> process, where the film was synchronised with phonograph records. The next year, he tried to emulate his music hall colleagues <a href="Billy%20Merson">Billy Merson</a> and Charlie Austin, who had set up Homeland Films and found success with the "<a href="Squibs%20%281921%20film%29">Squibs</a>" series of films starring <a href="Betty%20Balfour">Betty Balfour</a>. Robey met filmmakers from the Burns Film Company, who engaged him in a silent short entitled "George Robey Turns Anarchist", in which he played a character who fails to blow up the Houses of Parliament. He continued to appear sporadically in film throughout the rest of his career, never achieving more than a modest amount of success.

In 1914, for the first time in many years, Robey appeared in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in "Sinbad the Sailor"; <a href="Fred%20Emney%20Sr">Fred Emney Sr</a> played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.

By the First World War, music hall entertainment had fallen out of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. <a href="Revue">Revue</a> appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue "<a href="The%20Bing%20Boys%20Are%20Here">The Bing Boys Are Here</a>" at the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra Theatre</a>, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite <a href="Violet%20Loraine">Violet Loraine</a>, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song "<a href="If%20You%20Were%20the%20Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)</a>", which became an international success.
This London engagement was a new experience for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production, and he had never had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. "The Bing Boys Are Here" ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as "the first actor of the halls". He made two films towards the end of the war: "The Anti-frivolity League" in 1916 and "<a href="Doing%20His%20Bit">Doing His Bit</a>" the following year.

Robey left the cast of "The Bing Boys" during its run, in January 1917, to star at the <a href="Hippodrome%2C%20London">London Hippodrome</a> in <a href="Albert%20de%20Courville">Albert de Courville</a>, <a href="Dave%20Stamper">Dave Stamper</a> and <a href="Gene%20Buck">Gene Buck</a>'s lavishly-staged revue "<a href="Zig-Zag%21">Zig-Zag!</a>". Robey included a sketch based on his music hall character "The Prehistoric Man", with <a href="Daphne%20Pollard">Daphne Pollard</a> playing the role of "She of the Tireless Tongue". In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. "Zig-Zag" ran for 648 performances. Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, "The Bing Boys on Broadway". The show, again co-starring Violet Loraine, matched the popularity of its predecessor and beat the original show's run with a total of 562 performances.

Robey returned to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took a leading role in another hit revue, "<a href="Joy%20Bells">Joy Bells</a>". <a href="Phyllis%20Bedells">Phyllis Bedells</a> took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with <a href="Anita%20Elson">Anita Elson</a> and <a href="Leon%20Errol">Leon Errol</a> as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: "No, No, No" centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and "The Rest Cure" told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of <a href="malpractice">malpractice</a> from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper "La Tribuna", the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We do not want to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." "Joy Bells" ran for 723 performances.

In the early months of 1919, Robey completed a book of memoirs, "My Rest Cure", which was published later that year. During the run of "Joy Bells" he was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> for raising £14,000 for the French <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a>. He declined a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences; he was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> by George V at Buckingham Palace instead. On the morning of the penultimate "Joy Bells" performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario <a href="Alfred%20Butt">Sir Alfred Butt</a>, who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. He and Loraine sang "If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)".

A gap in the Alhambra's schedule allowed Stoll to showcase Robey in a new short film. "George Robey's Day Off" (1919) showed the comedian acting out his daily domestic routines to comic effect, but the picture failed at the box office. The British director <a href="John%20Baxter%20%28director%29">John Baxter</a> concluded that producers did not know how best to apply Robey's stage talents to film.

By 1920 variety theatre had become popular in Britain, and Robey had completed the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad lib</a>, was also beginning to fall out of favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.

Robey's first revue of the 1920s was "Johnny Jones", which opened on 1 June 1920 at the Alhambra Theatre. The show also featured <a href="Ivy%20St.%20Helier">Ivy St. Helier</a>, <a href="Lupino%20Lane">Lupino Lane</a> and <a href="Eric%20Blore">Eric Blore</a> and carried the advertisement "A Robey salad with musical dressing". One of the show's more popular gags was a scene in which Robey picked and ate cherries off St. Helier's hat, before tossing the stones into the orchestra pit which were then met by loud bangs from the bass drum. A sign of his popularity came in August 1920 when he was depicted in scouting costume for a series of 12 <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> stamps in aid of the Printers Pension Corporation War Orphans and the Prince of Wales Boy Scout Funds.

The revue "Robey en Casserole" (1921) was next for Robey, during which he led a troupe of dancers in a musical piece called the "Policemen Ballet". Each dancer was dressed in a mock police uniform on top and a <a href="Ballet%20tutu">tutu</a> below. The show was the first failure for the comedian under Stoll's management. That December Robey appeared in his only London pantomime, "Jack and the Beanstalk", at the Hippodrome. His biographer, Peter Cotes, remembered the comedian's interpretation of Dame Trot as "enormously funny: a bucolic caricature of a woman, sturdy and fruity, leathery and forbidding" and thought that Robey's comic timing was "in a class of its own." In March 1922 Robey remained at the Hippodrome in the revue "Round in Fifty", a modernised version of "Round the World in Eighty Days", which proved to be another hit for the London theatre, and a personal favourite of the comedian.

Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences a further four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the intention of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: "One Arabian Night" was a reworking of "<a href="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>" and co-starred <a href="Lionelle%20Howard">Lionelle Howard</a> and <a href="Edward%20O%27Neill%20%28actor%29">Edward O'Neill</a>, while "Harlequinade" visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was <a href="Sancho%20Panza">Sancho Panza</a> in <a href="Maurice%20Elvey">Maurice Elvey</a>'s 1923 film "<a href="Don%20Quixote%20%281923%20film%29">Don Quixote</a>", for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies and walked out of the family home.

Robey made a return to the London Hippodrome in 1924 in the revue "Leap Year" in which he co-starred with Laddie Cliff, Betty Chester and <a href="Vera%20Pearce">Vera Pearce</a>. "Leap Year" was set in South Africa, Australia and Canada, and was written to appeal to the tourists who were visiting London from the Commonwealth countries. Robey was much to their tastes, and his rendition of "My Old Dutch" helped the show achieve another long run of 421 performances. "Sky High" was next and opened at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> in March 1925. The chorus dancer Marie Blanche was his co-star, a partnership that caused the gossip columnists to comment on the performers' alleged romance two years previously. Despite the rumours Blanche continued as his leading lady for the next four years, and "Sky High" lasted for 309 performances on the West End stage.

The year 1926 was lacking in variety entertainment, a fact largely attributed to the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">UK general strike</a> that had occurred in May of that year. The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star in a series of variety dates for <a href="Moss%20Empires">Moss Empires</a>. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of "Bits and Pieces" and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out to see the show. He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he was sure the audiences would embrace his new show. However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" and that he heavily edit the sketch "The Cheat". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and "Bits and Pieces" enjoyed rave reviews. It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension.

In the spring of 1927 Robey embraced the opportunity to tour abroad, when he and his company took "Bits and Pieces" to South Africa, where it was received favourably. By the time he had left Cape Town, he had played to over 60,000 people and had travelled in excess of 15,000 miles. Upon his return to England in October, he took "Bits and Pieces" to <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>. In August 1928, Robey and his company travelled to Canada, where they played to packed audiences for three months. It was there that he produced a new revue, "Between Ourselves", in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, which was staged especially for the country's armed forces. The Canadians were enthusiastic about Robey; he was awarded the <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20city">freedom of the city</a> in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a>, made a chieftain of the <a href="Tsuu%20T%27ina%20Nation">Sarcee tribe</a>, and was an honorary guest at a cricket match in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, Alberta. He described the tour as "one of unbroken happiness." In the late 1920s Robey also wrote and starred in two <a href="Phonofilm">Phonofilm</a> sound-on-film productions, "Safety First" (1928) and "Mrs. Mephistopheles" (1929).

In early 1929 Robey returned to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with "Bits and Pieces", after which he started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, where he performed to packed audiences over the course of a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>, "<a href="The%20Temperance%20F%C3%AAte">The Temperance Fête</a>", and followed this with "Marry Me", which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.

By the later months of 1932, Robey had formed a romantic relationship with the Littlers' daughter Blanche (1897–1981), who then took over as his manager. The couple grew close during the filming of <a href="Don%20Quixote%20%281933%20film%29">"Don Quixote"</a>, a remake of the comedian's 1923 success as Sancho Panza. Unlike its predecessor, "Don Quixote" had an ambitious script, big budget and an authentic foreign setting. Robey, however, resented having to grow a beard for the role and disliked the French climate and gruelling 12-week filming schedule. He refused to act out his character's death scene in a farcical way and also objected to the lateness of the "dreadfully banal" scripts, which were often written the night before filming.

Until 1932 Robey had never played in legitimate theatre, although he read <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> from an early age. That year he took the part of King Menelaus in "Helen!", which was an English-language adaptation by <a href="A.%20P.%20Herbert">A. P. Herbert</a> of Offenbach's operetta "<a href="La%20belle%20H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne">La belle Hélène</a>". The show's producer <a href="Charles%20B.%20Cochran">C. B. Cochran</a>, a longstanding admirer of Robey, engaged a prestigious cast for the production, including <a href="Evelyn%20Laye">Evelyn Laye</a> and W. H. Berry, with choreography by <a href="L%C3%A9onide%20Massine">Léonide Massine</a> and sets by <a href="Oliver%20Messel">Oliver Messel</a>. The operetta opened on 30 January 1932, becoming the <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi Theatre</a>'s most successful show of the year. The critic Harold Conway wrote that while Robey had reached the pinnacle of his career as a variety star, which only required him to rely on his "breezy, cheeky personality", he had reservations about the comedian's ability to "integrate himself with the other stars ... to learn many pages of dialogue, and to remember countless cues."

After the run of "Helen!", Robey briefly resumed his commitments to the variety stage before signing a contract to appear at the Savoy Theatre as Bold Ben Blister in the operetta "Jolly Roger", which premiered in March 1933. The production had a run of bad luck, including an actors' strike which was caused by Robey's refusal to join the actors' union <a href="Equity%20%28trade%20union%29">Equity</a>. The dispute was settled when he was included as a co-producer of the show, thus excluding him as a full-time actor. Robey made a substantial donation to the union, and the production went ahead. Despite its troubles, the show was a success and received much praise from the press. Harold Conway of the "Daily Mail" called the piece "one of the outstanding triumphs of personality witnessed in a London theatre". Later that year, Robey completed his final autobiography, "Looking Back on Life". The literary critic Graham Sutton admired Robey for his honest and frank account, and thought that he was "at his best when most personal".

According to Wilson, Robey revered Shakespeare and had an "excellent reading knowledge of the Bard" even though the comedian had never seen a Shakespeare play. As a child, he had committed to memory the "ghost" scene in "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>". Writing in 1933, Cochran expressed the opinion that Robey had been a victim of a largely conservative and "snobbish" attitude from theatre managers, that the comedian was "cut out for Shakespeare", and that if he had been frequently engaged in playing the Bard's works, then "Shakespeare would probably have been popular." In 1934, the theatre director Sydney Carroll offered Robey the chance to appear as <a href="Nick%20Bottom">Nick Bottom</a> in "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" at the <a href="Open%20Air%20Theatre%2C%20Regent%27s%20Park">Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park</a>, but he initially declined the offer, citing a hectic schedule, including a conflict with his appearance in that year's Royal Variety Performance on 8 May. He was also concerned that he would not be taken seriously by legitimate theatre critics and knew that he would not be able to include a comic sketch or to engage in his customary resourceful gagging. In the same year, Robey starred in <a href="Chu%20Chin%20Chow%20%281934%20film%29">a film version</a> of the hit musical "<a href="Chu%20Chin%20Chow">Chu Chin Chow</a>". "The New York Times" called him "a lovable and laughable Ali Baba".

At the start of 1935 Robey accepted his first Shakespearean role, as <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a> in "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>", which surprised the press and worried fans who thought that he might retire the Prime Minister of Mirth. The theatrical press were sceptical of a music hall performer taking on such a distinguished role; Carroll, the play's producer, vehemently defended his casting choice. Carroll later admitted taking a gamble on employing Robey but wrote that the comedian "has unlimited courage in challenging criticism and risking his reputation on a venture of this kind; he takes both his past and his future in both hands and is faced with the alternative of dashing them into the depths or lifting them to a height hitherto undreamt of." Carroll further opined that "[Robey] has never failed in anything he has undertaken. He is one of the most intelligent and capable of actors."

"Henry IV, Part I" opened on 28 February at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">Her Majesty's Theatre</a>, and Robey proved himself to be a capable Shakespearean actor, though his Shakespearean debut was marred initially by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from "<a href="Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was "far from word perfect". Writing in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", the critic <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a> said of Robey's portrayal: "In no performance within my memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation". Another journalist, writing in the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>", thought that Robey "gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself".

In any case, such was Robey's popularity in the role that the German theatre and film producer <a href="Max%20Reinhardt">Max Reinhardt</a> declared that, should the opportunity arise for a film version, the comedian would be his perfect choice as Falstaff. Cotes described Robey as having "a great vitality and immense command of the [role]. He never faltered, he had to take his audience by the throat and make them attentive at once because he couldn't play himself in." Although he was eager to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle nod in the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff. The poet <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> responded to the critics' early scepticism: "Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff". Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement.

Robey made his radio debut in 1936 when he was interviewed for "The Spice of Life" programme for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. He spoke about his private life and his time spent on the music hall circuit, which he described as the "most enjoyable experience" of his life. The usually reserved Robey admitted that privately he was not a sociable person and that he often grew tired of his audiences while performing on stage, but that he got his biggest thrill from making others laugh. He also declared a love for the outdoors and mentioned that, to relax, he would draw "comic scribbles" of himself as the Prime Minister of Mirth, which he would occasionally give to fans. As a result of the interview he received more than a thousand fan letters from listeners. Wilson thought that Robey's "perfect diction and intimate manner made him an ideal broadcast speaker". The press commented favourably on his performance, with one reporter from "Variety Life" writing: "I doubt whether any speaker other than a stage idol could have used, as Robey did, the first person singular almost incessantly for half an hour without causing something akin to resentment. ... The comedian's talk was brilliantly conceived and written."

In the later months of 1936, Robey repeated his radio success with a thirty-minute programme entitled "Music-Hall", recorded for American audiences, to honour the tenth birthday of the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Corporation</a>. In it, he presented a montage of his characterisations as well as impressions of other famous acts of the day. A second programme, which he recorded the following year, featured the comedian speaking fondly of cricket and of the many well-known players whom he had met on his frequent visits to the Oval and Lord's cricket grounds over his fifty-year association.

In the summer of 1938 Robey appeared in the film "<a href="A%20Girl%20Must%20Live">A Girl Must Live</a>", directed by <a href="Carol%20Reed">Carol Reed</a>, in which he played the role of Horace Blount. A report in the "Kinematograph Weekly" commented that the 69-year-old comedian was still able to "stand up to the screen by day and variety by night." A journalist for "The Times" opined that Robey's performance as an elderly furrier, the love interest of both <a href="Margaret%20Lockwood">Margaret Lockwood</a> and <a href="Lilli%20Palmer">Lilli Palmer</a>, was "a perfect study in bewildered embarrassment".

Robey made his television debut in August 1938 but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his "comic quality" was conveyed on the small screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should "be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were "really too slow for television".

That November, and with his divorce from Ethel finalised, Robey married Blanche Littler, who was more than two decades his junior, at Marylebone Town Hall. At Christmas, he fractured three ribs and bruised his spine when he accidentally fell into the orchestra pit while appearing in the 1938–39 pantomime "Robinson Crusoe" in Birmingham. He attributed the fall to his face mask which gave him a limited view of the stage. The critic Harold Conway was less forgiving, blaming the accident on the comedian's "lost self-confidence" and opining that the accident was the start of Robey's professional decline.

Aware of demand for his act in Australia, Robey conducted a second tour of the country at the start of 1939. While he was appearing at the <a href="New%20Tivoli%20Theatre%2C%20Sydney">Tivoli Theatre</a> in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining to raise money for the <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a>. He signed up with the <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.

During the 1940s, Robey appeared predominantly in troop concerts as himself but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently poke fun at the "<a href="Little%20Englander">Little Englander</a>s", but audiences thought that he was sympathising with <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for <a href="bolshevism">bolshevism</a> was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as "Robeyisms", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity. Cotes wrote that Robey was not a politician, merely a jingoist, who "lived long enough to feel [that] his little-Englander outlook [was causing him] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay."

Robey starred in the film "<a href="Salute%20John%20Citizen">Salute John Citizen</a>" in 1942, directed by Maurice Elvey and co-starring <a href="Edward%20Rigby">Edward Rigby</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Holloway">Stanley Holloway</a>, about the effects that the war had on a normal British family. In a 1944 review of the film, Robey was described as being "convincing in [an] important role" but the film itself had "dull moments in the simple tale". That Christmas, Robey travelled to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where he starred in the pantomime "Robinson Crusoe". A further four films followed in 1943, one of which promoted war propaganda while the other two displayed the popular medium of <a href="cine-variety">cine-variety</a>. Cine-variety introduced Robey to the <a href="Rainbow%20Theatre">Astoria</a> in Finsbury Park, London, a venue which was used to huge audiences and big-name acts and was described as "a super-cinema".

During the early months of 1944, Robey returned to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>", produced by <a href="Eagle-Lion%20Films">Eagle-Lion Films</a>. The American film critic <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" in 1946, he thought that it showcased "a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors", who contributed to "a stunningly brilliant and intriguing screen spectacle". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene "non-essential and just a bit grotesque." Late in 1944, he appeared in <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a> in a show entitled "Vive Paree" alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian. In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as "Old Sam" in "The Trojan Brothers", a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse, and as "Vogel" in the musical romance "<a href="Waltz%20Time%20%281945%20film%29">Waltz Time</a>". He spent 1947 touring England, while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play "The Windmill Man", which he also co-produced with his wife.

In June 1951, now aged 81, Robey starred in a midnight gala performance at the London Palladium in aid of the family of <a href="Sid%20Field">Sid Field</a> who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" and "If You Were the Only Girl in the World"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums. The American comedian <a href="Danny%20Kaye">Danny Kaye</a>, who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a "great, great artist". The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared at the beginning of his career. On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>" for which he chose among others "Mondo ladro", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>'s opera "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>". For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events.

Robey took part in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951, which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script. His wife sat at the side of the stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening. The following month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show "Do You Remember?" under the management of <a href="Bernard%20Delfont">Bernard Delfont</a>. After an evening's performance in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: "Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that. I could not think of starting a new career at my age!" In December, he opened the Lansbury Lodge home for retired cricketers in <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a>, East London; he considered the ceremony to be one of the "happiest memories of his life."

By early 1952, Robey was becoming noticeably frail, and he lost interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed "<a href="The%20Pickwick%20Papers%20%281952%20film%29">The Pickwick Papers</a>", in which he played the role of old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as <a href="Harlequinade%23Clown">Clown</a> in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the <a href="Victoria%20Palace%20Theatre">Victoria Palace Theatre</a>. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.

In the early months of 1954, a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> was conferred on Robey by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a> at Buckingham Palace. During the following weeks, his health declined; he became confined to a wheelchair and spent the majority of his time at home under the care of his wife. In May he opened a British Red Cross fete in <a href="Seaford%2C%20East%20Sussex">Seaford, East Sussex</a>, and, a month later, made his last public appearance, on television as a panellist in the English version of "<a href="The%20Name%27s%20the%20Same">The Name's the Same</a>". Wilson called Robey's performance "pathetic" and thought that he appeared with only "a hint of his old self". By June he had become housebound and quietly celebrated his 85th birthday surrounded by family; visiting friends were organised into appointments by his wife Blanche, but theatrical colleagues were barred in case they caused the comedian too much excitement.

Robey suffered a stroke on 20 November and remained in a semi-coma for just over a week. He died on 29 November 1954 at his home in Saltdean, East Sussex, and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium in Brighton. Blanche continued to live on the Sussex coast until her death at the age of 83 in 1981.

News of Robey's death prompted tributes from the press, who printed illustrations, anecdotes and reminders of his stage performances and charitable activities. "Knighthood notwithstanding, George Robey long ago made himself a place as an entertainer and artist of the people", declared a reporter from the "Daily Worker", while a critic for the "Daily Mail" wrote: "Personality has become a wildly misused word since his heyday, but George Robey breathed it in every pore." In Robey's obituary in "The Spectator", Compton Mackenzie called the comedian "one of the last great figures of the late Victorian and Edwardian music-hall."

In December 1954, a memorial service for Robey was held at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20Stepney">Bishop of Stepney</a>, <a href="Joost%20de%20Blank">Joost de Blank</a>, said: "We have lost a great English music hall artist, one of the greatest this country has known in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries." Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian <a href="Leslie%20Henson">Leslie Henson</a>, who called Robey "that great obstinate bullock of variety". In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than £2,000,000 for charitable causes, with £500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War. In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a>, Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the <a href="Royal%20Sussex%20County%20Hospital">Royal Sussex Hospital</a> later bought a new <a href="Dialysis">dialysis machine</a> in his memory.

Robey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary. The radio personality <a href="Robb%20Wilton">Robb Wilton</a> acknowledged learning a lot from him, and although he felt that Robey "was not very funny", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey "still didn't make me laugh," although he described him as "a legend" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's "droll like humour" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and <a href="Grock">Grock</a>'s clowning. Cotes wrote: "His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest."

Violet Loraine called her former co-star "one of the greatest comedians the world has ever known", while the theatrical producer Basil Dean opined that "George was a great artist, one of the last and the really big figures of his era. They don't breed them like that now." The actor <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, who remembered meeting Robey at the Alhambra Theatre in 1953, called the comedian "charming, gracious [and] one of the few really great ones" of the music hall era. Upon his death, Robey's costume for the Prime Minister of Mirth was donated to the <a href="London%20Museum">London Museum</a>, where it is on permanent display.

SMS Preussen (1903)

SMS "Preussen" was the fourth of five <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of the , built for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). She was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in April 1902, was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in October 1903, and was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> in July 1905. Named for the state of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, the ship was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . Like all pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, "Preussen" was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, she saw only limited service with the German fleet.

"Preussen"s peacetime career centered on squadron and fleet exercises and training cruises to foreign ports. The ship served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, she served as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> and later in the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>. She participated in a fleet <a href="sortie">sortie</a> in December 1914 in support of the <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> during which the German fleet briefly clashed with a detachment of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. "Preussen" had been temporarily assigned to guard ship duties in the Baltic in May 1916, and so missed the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. Due to her age, she did not rejoin the fleet, and instead continued to serve as a guard ship until 1917, when she became a <a href="ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> for <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s based in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>.

After the war, "Preussen" was retained by the re-formed "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" and converted into a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a> for F-type <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s. She was stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a> in April 1929 and sold to ship breakers in 1931. A section of her hull was retained as a target; it was bombed and sunk in 1945 by Allied bombers at the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and was scrapped in 1954.

With the passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, the supplier of naval artillery to the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) had developed <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a>, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the "Wittelsbach"s. The Design Department of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s as torpedoes became more effective. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> in December 1906, less than a year and a half after "Preussen" entered service. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> of the German navy obsolete, including "Preussen".

"Preussen" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. At full load, she <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> . Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Preussen"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of .

"Preussen"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and eighteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, and the final tube was in the stern. "Preussen" was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick, the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and propulsion machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.

"Preussen" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in April 1902 at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> shipyard in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a> under construction number 256. The fourth unit of her class, she had been ordered under the contract name "K" as a new unit for the fleet. "Preussen" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 30 October 1903, with a speech given by <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> <a href="Bernhard%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Bernhard von Bülow</a> and the christening performed by <a href="Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Empress Augusta Victoria</a>. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 12 July 1905. <a href="Sea%20trials">Sea trials</a> lasted until September, when she formally joined <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Squadron</a>, where she replaced the battleship as the squadron <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. "VAdm" <a href="Max%20von%20Fischel">Max von Fischel</a> was the squadron commander at the time.
The German fleet was occupied with extensive training exercises during the early 1900s. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April 1906, the only interruption being in February, when "Preussen" carried <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in company with the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and the torpedo boats and . Wilhelm II attended the burial of the Danish King <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Christian IX</a>, who had died the previous month. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. During <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> on 21 June, "Preussen" received a gift from the provinces of <a href="West%20Prussia">West Prussia</a> and <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>, in the form of a <a href="Flag%20of%20Prussia">Prussian war flag</a>. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July, and the fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a>, to join exercises being conducted there.

The fleet was back in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, after which the fleet conducted the annual autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September. The exercises included landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a>. On 1 October 1907, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Schr%C3%B6der">Ludwig von Schröder</a> came aboard "Preussen", taking command of the squadron, as Fischel had become the chief of the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Nordsee">Marinestation der Nordsee</a>" (Naval Station of the North Sea). The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November.

The fleet conducted training exercises in the Baltic in February 1908. <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a>, then the commander of the High Seas Fleet, had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a> were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. During the cruise, "Preussen" visited <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures.

In early 1909, "Preussen" and the battleships and were sent to break paths in the sea ice off the coast of Holstein for merchant shipping. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which "Preussen" stopped in <a href="El%20Ferrol">El Ferrol</a>, Spain. On the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. Later that year, Admiral <a href="Henning%20von%20Holtzendorff">Henning von Holtzendorff</a> became the fleet commander. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from the Baltic Sea port of Kiel to the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.

In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 29 August. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Schröder was promoted to chief of the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Ostsee">Marinestation der Ostsee</a>" (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), his place aboard "Preussen" being taken by "VAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In March 1911, the fleet held exercises in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, and the year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> and Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a>.

In mid-1912, due to the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part due to Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision; Ingenohl took Holtzendorff's place, and "KAdm" <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> in turn replaced Ingenohl as II Squadron commander on 4 February. In late August, the squadron steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at the start of the autumn maneuvers to reach the island of Helgoland; the voyage through the canal was notable, because the canal had been closed for over a year while it was enlarged to allow the passage of larger <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s. "Preussen" went into <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> in November for periodic maintenance, and as a result, missed training exercises conducted that month.

"Preussen" participated in ceremonies at <a href="Sonderburg">Sonderburg</a> on 2 May to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dybb%C3%B8l">Battle of Dybbøl</a> of the <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a>; she was joined by her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s and , the battleship , and the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> . The ship was present during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which was cut short by the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> following the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> the month before and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was made aware of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>'s <a href="July%20Ultimatum">ultimatum to Serbia</a>; "Preussen" left Norway to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet the following day. "Preussen" had been slated to be decommissioned at the end of the year, her place as the squadron flagship to be taken by the dreadnought . "Preussen" was to then replace in the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea, but the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> cancelled those plans.

After the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German command deployed II Squadron in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> to defend Germany's coast from a major attack from the Royal Navy that the Germans presumed was imminent. "Preussen" and her squadron mates were stationed in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> to support the vessels on patrol duty in the Bight. Once it became clear that the British would not attack the High Seas Fleet, the Germans began a series of operations designed to lure out a portion of the numerically superior British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> and destroy it. By achieving a rough equality of forces, the German navy could then force a decisive battle in the southern portion of the North Sea.

The first such operation in which the High Seas Fleet participated was the <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> on 15–16 December 1914. The main fleet acted as distant support for "KAdm" <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s battlecruiser squadron while it raided the coastal towns. On the evening of 15 December, the fleet came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl, who was now the German fleet commander, that the entire Grand Fleet was deployed before him. Under orders from Wilhelm II to avoid battle if victory was not certain, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany. At the end of the month, Scheer was replaced by "KAdm" <a href="Felix%20Funke">Felix Funke</a>, Scheer going on to command <a href="III%20Battle%20Squadron">III Battle Squadron</a>.

On 14 March 1915, "Preussen" went to Kiel for periodic maintenance, and she was replaced as the squadron flagship by the battleship . The latter vessel held the position for the remainder of the squadron's existence, with the exceptions of 19 September to 16 October 1915, 25 February to 7 April 1916, in September that year, and from 22 January to 10 February 1917; during each of these periods, "Preussen" temporarily resumed the flagship role. Starting in April 1916, the ships of II Squadron were tasked with patrolling the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>; each ship of the squadron was to rotate through the duty, the others remaining in the Elbe or serving with the main fleet. "Preussen" began her first stint on 21 April, replacing "Hessen"; she was accordingly absent during the <a href="bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft</a> three days later. On 4 May, "Preussen" was relieved and she returned to the Elbe, though she was transferred back to the straits on 21 May, remaining there until 8 June. As a result, she missed the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, fought on 31 May – 1 June in the North Sea. Her sister ship "Lothringen" also missed the battle, as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in the fleet sortie.

Jutland proved to Scheer, who was now the fleet commander, that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable to take part in a major fleet action, and so he detached II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. As a result, "Preussen" remained in service only as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a>. She saw further stints in the Danish straits from 30 June to 23 July and from 15 to 31 August. On 13 March 1917, "Preussen" left the Elbe and steamed to the Baltic, where she was temporarily used as an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> to clear a path to <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>. She was decommissioned on 5 August, and most of her crew were transferred to the new <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> . From then to the end of the war, she served as a <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> for III U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven. "Preussen" briefly held <a href="Edouard%20Izac">Edouard Izac</a>, a US Navy sailor captured after his ship was sunk by , in June 1918; Izac would go on to escape from a German prisoner of war camp and win the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>.

Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under —two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. "Preussen" was among those ships chosen to remain on active service with the "Reichsmarine". The ship was converted into a parent ship for F-type <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a> at the <a href="Kriegsmarinewerft%20Wilhelmshaven">Kriegsmarinewerft</a> in Wilhelmshaven in 1919; the ship was disarmed and platforms for holding the minesweepers were installed.

"Preussen" was commissioned with the "Reichsmarine" to support the minesweeping effort, though she proved to be too top-heavy to serve as an effective mothership, and she was soon replaced by the old light cruiser . "Preussen" was placed in reserve and was left out of service until 1929, when she was stricken from the naval register on 5 April. The "Reichsmarine" sold her to ship breakers on 25 February 1931 for 216,800 <a href="Reichsmark">Reichsmark</a>s. "Preussen" was subsequently broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven, though a length of her hull was retained as a testing target for underwater weapons, including torpedoes and mines. The section of hull was nicknamed "SMS "Vierkant" ("SMS Rectangle"). Allied bombers attacked and sank the section of "Preussen"s hull in April 1945. It was eventually raised and scrapped in late 1954.

No. 36 Squadron RAAF

No. 36 Squadron is a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) strategic transport squadron. It operates <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a> heavy airlifters from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland. The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War II, the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia "Konfrontasi"</a>, the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and the <a href="Operation%20Slipper">wars in Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Iraq</a>. It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world, including Somalia, Cambodia, East Timor and Indonesia.

The squadron was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, in March 1942, and equipped with <a href="Douglas%20DC-2">Douglas DC-2</a>s, among other aircraft. Later in the war it began operating <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>. From 1946 to 1953 it was controlled by <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Transport) Wing</a>, which was based in New South Wales at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a> and, later, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>. In 1953 it was re-formed at <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a>, Japan, as part of <a href="No.%2091%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 91 (Composite) Wing</a>. It returned to Australia and the aegis of No. 86 Wing in 1955. The squadron began re-equipping with <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a> at Richmond in 1958, becoming the first non-US operator of the type. Over the next half-century it flew two models of Hercules, the and . The squadron transferred to Amberley in 2006, when it took delivery of its first Globemaster.

No. 36 Squadron is responsible for strategic air transport in Australia and overseas, conducting missions as part of military operations and humanitarian efforts. It is located at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, and controlled by <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing</a>, which is part of <a href="Air%20Mobility%20Group%20RAAF">Air Mobility Group</a>. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular servicing of equipment; they are frequently required to accompany the aircraft on deployments overseas. More complex servicing is conducted by <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>. No. 36 Squadron's official crest, approved in May 1966, depicts a horse intended to symbolise strength, speed, mobility and dependability. The unit's motto is "Sure".

The squadron operates eight <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a>s, the first of which entered service in December 2006. The eighth and last was delivered in November 2015. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a <a href="loadmaster">loadmaster</a>, the latter being responsible for the loading, carriage and unloading of cargo or passengers. The C-17 can carry 70 tonnes of equipment, and is large enough to accommodate helicopters, tanks and other military vehicles. It can also carry over 130 passengers, and is designed for aerial despatch of paratroops or cargo. The C-17 has a range of some and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips. Flown with a joystick and <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> controls, the aircraft is also highly manoeuvrable and responsive considering its size. It can be <a href="aerial%20refueling">refuelled in flight</a> by the <a href="Airbus%20A330%20MRTT">Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports</a> operated by <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a>.

During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, <a href="No.%2034%20Squadron%20RAAF">34</a>, <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAAF">35</a> and 36 Squadrons. No. 36 Squadron was established on 11 March at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, under the control of <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>. Its initial strength was twenty-six personnel and one <a href="Douglas%20DC-2">Douglas DC-2</a>. This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well as examples of various <a href="de%20Havilland">de Havilland</a> types including the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon">DH.84 Dragon</a>, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Express">DH.86 Express</a>, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">DH.89 Dragon Rapide</a>, and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moth</a>. Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to <a href="Port%20Moresby%20Airfield%20Complex">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea, the squadron relocated to <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a>, Victoria, on 17 July. One of the DC-2s crashed at <a href="Port%20Moresby%20Airfield%20Complex%23Jackson%20Airfield%20%287%20Mile%20Drome%29">Seven Mile Aerodrome</a>, Port Moresby, on 14 September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, on 11 December 1942. During 1943, it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea, and began re-equipping with twelve <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>.

On 27 March 1943, a Dakota of No. 36 Squadron crashed on takeoff in pre-dawn fog at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Archerfield">RAAF Station Archerfield</a>, killing all twenty-three occupants, twenty of whom were RAAF or <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> personnel. The squadron relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Garbutt</a> on 20 February 1944. During the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a> it was responsible for carrying troops and cargo, and undertaking courier runs and supply drops. In 1945, a detachment of No. 36 Squadron Dakotas augmented <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing's</a> operations in <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville</a>, flying almost 800 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s between January and June. The squadron lost two Dakotas on supply missions in <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a> during February 1945. In August, it flew paratroopers into Singapore as part of the reoccupation of the city, after which it continued to transport troops and cargo, and repatriate prisoners of war. Following the end of hostilities, in March 1946, a detachment of six Dakotas established a courier service between <a href="Leo%20Wattimena%20Airport">Morotai</a> and Japan, where Australian units had joined the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>.

On 19 August 1946, No. 36 Squadron transferred to <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a>, New South Wales, where it came under the control of No. 86 (Transport) Wing along with <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 37</a> and <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">38 Squadrons</a>, also operating Dakotas, and <a href="No.%20486%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>. No. 486 Squadron provided day-to-day servicing for each of the flying squadrons, deeper maintenance being handled by <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot">No. 2 Aircraft Depot</a>, based at the nearby <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>. Courier flights to Japan continued until December 1947, a round trip from Schofields. On 25 August 1948, twenty staff from No. 36 Squadron joined five crews from No. 38 Squadron to <a href="RAAF%20Squadron%20Berlin%20Air%20Lift">take part in the Berlin Airlift</a>, a commitment that lasted almost a year. The Australians delivered over of supplies, and over 7,000 passengers. In the absence of these crews, Nos. 36 and 38 Squadron operations were amalgamated, flying hours being recorded under the latter's auspices. During June 1949, No. 36 Squadron and the other extant components of No. 86 Wing, Nos. 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated from Schofields to Richmond.

Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons began to operate separately again in June 1950, following the return of crews from Berlin and No. 38 Squadron's departure for service in the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. No. 36 Squadron assumed control of the <a href="Governor-General%27s%20Flight%20RAAF">Governor-General's Flight</a> in October 1950. On 21 November 1952, the squadron was awarded the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Duke of Gloucester Cup</a> for its proficiency. The return of No. 38 Squadron from Malaya in December stripped No. 36 Squadron of crews to ensure an even distribution of personnel among the two units. This led to No. 36 Squadron again merging with No. 38 Squadron. The former disbanded at Richmond on 9 March 1953, re-forming the next day from <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Transport Unit</a> at <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a>, Japan. Here it was part of <a href="No.%2091%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 91 (Composite) Wing</a>, which controlled the RAAF's units during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and its immediate aftermath. Its complement included eight Dakotas and one <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>. In July and August, the squadron evacuated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war. It departed Japan on 13 March 1955, having carried over 42,000 passengers and of cargo, and was re-established on 1 May at <a href="Fairbairn%2C%20Canberra">RAAF Base Canberra</a>, where No. 86 Wing had transferred the previous year.

No. 36 Squadron handed over its six Dakotas to No. 38 Squadron in July 1958, prior to re-equipping with the <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a>. It returned to Richmond in August, followed by the rest of No. 86 Wing a month later. After conversion training of its personnel in the United States, No. 36 Squadron became the first non-US operator of the Hercules in December 1958, when it began taking delivery of twelve C-130As; deliveries completed in March 1959. The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in payload, range, and speed. In September 1960, No. 36 Squadron began parachute trials on the Hercules. It made the Hercules' first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone in December 1962, joining a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the onset of the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"Konfrontasi"</a> between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions were undertaken over the next five years. The squadron was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in 1963.

In August 1964, No. 36 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing. No. 486 Squadron was disbanded at the same time, leaving No. 36 Squadron responsible for its own day-to-day maintenance until 1966; No. 486 Squadron was re-formed that year to service both No. 36 Squadron and No. 37 Squadron, the latter having taken delivery of twelve C-130E Hercules. During the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, both squadrons undertook long-range transport and medical evacuation flights between Australia and South East Asia, servicing <a href="Phan%20Rang%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Th%C3%A1p%20Ch%C3%A0m">Phan Rang</a>, <a href="Vung%20Tau">Vung Tau</a>, and <a href="Nui%20Dat">Nui Dat</a>. No. 36 Squadron was presented with its own <a href="Heraldic%20flag">standard</a> by <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, on 1 April 1971, in recognition of a quarter-century's service. Eight of its twelve Hercules were involved in relief efforts after <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> struck <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, on Christmas Eve 1974; the aircraft flew over 550 hours, carrying 2,864 passengers and almost of cargo. Having remained in service for twenty years, clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours, the C-130As were replaced by C-130Hs in 1978.
In November 1978, one of No. 36 Squadron's C-130Hs became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at <a href="McMurdo%20Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>. The squadron reached a total of 200,000 accident-free flying hours in C-130s during 1984. When No. 86 Wing was re-formed at Richmond on 2 February 1987, under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), No. 36 Squadron formed part of its complement. The unit again received the Gloucester Cup in 1989. That year, it provided transport for civilian passengers during the <a href="1989%20Australian%20pilots%27%20dispute">pilots' dispute</a> that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; three aircraft and five crews undertook this task, over and above their normal duties. The squadron reached 100,000 accident-free flying hours on the C-130H during 1990. In December 1990 and January 1991, it flew missions to <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> in support of Australia's naval contribution to the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, and in 1993 transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of <a href="Operation%20Solace">Operation Solace</a>. Four of its C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and countermeasures such as <a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a> and flares, in 1994. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> equipment and crewed by RAAF and <a href="Defence%20Signals%20Directorate">Defence Signals Directorate</a> personnel.

Six of No. 36 Squadron's Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the <a href="1997%20clashes%20in%20Cambodia">coup in July 1997</a>. The unit again became responsible for its own routine maintenance in 1998, when No. 486 Squadron was disbanded. A detachment from No. 36 Squadron supported <a href="International%20Force%20for%20East%20Timor">INTERFET</a> operations in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> between September 1999 and February 2000. The squadron was assigned four C-130Es previously operated by No. 37 Squadron during the latter's transition to the new <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20C-130J%20Super%20Hercules">C-130J Super Hercules</a>, which commenced in 1999; the E models were retired the following year. No. 36 Squadron was once more awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001. It took part in relief efforts following the <a href="2002%20Bali%20Bombings">Bali Bombings</a> in October 2002. In February 2003, it deployed a detachment of two Hercules to the Middle East as part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq</a>. The aircraft arrived on 10 February, and began flying transport sorties less than two weeks later. A No. 36 Squadron Hercules became the first Coalition aircraft to land at <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a>, west of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, after it was secured by Australian special forces personnel. One aircraft was hit by ground fire near Baghdad on 27 June 2004, killing a coalition passenger. The detachment remained in Iraq until September 2004, when it was relieved by two C-130Js from No. 37 Squadron. No. 36 Squadron also participated in <a href="Operation%20Sumatra%20Assist">Operation Sumatra Assist</a> in the wake of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Boxing Day tsunami</a>.

In May 2006, No. 36 Squadron personnel began conversion training in the US in preparation for re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemaster III heavy transports. It transferred its C-130Hs to No. 37 Squadron on 17 November 2006, prior to relocating to Amberley. Also on 17 November, Wing Commander <a href="Linda%20Corbould">Linda Corbould</a> took command of the unit, becoming the first woman to lead an RAAF flying squadron. Corbould was responsible for delivering the first Globemaster from the United States to Australia on 4 December. No. 36 Squadron achieved initial operating capability with the C-17 on 11 September 2007, following eight months' work-up training. In June 2008, it received the Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient flying squadron of 2007 "for achieving all training objectives, supporting air lift activities globally and nationally and fulfilling short-notice, high priority tasks, despite the squadron's expertise being in its infancy". Corbould completed her posting as commanding officer on 8 December 2008, the day the squadron marked the second anniversary of C-17 operations by conducting the RAAF's first flight with an all-female aircrew.

Since re-equipping with the Globemaster, No. 36 Squadron has continued to support <a href="Operation%20Slipper">Coalition forces in Afghanistan</a>, as well as humanitarian operations worldwide. In 2011, it took part in relief efforts following the <a href="2010%E2%80%932011%20Queensland%20floods">floods in Queensland</a>, the <a href="2011%20Christchurch%20earthquake">Christchurch earthquake</a>, and the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a> in Japan. The Queensland floods necessitated the evacuation of two C-17s to Richmond, when Amberley was threatened by rising waters; of the other two Globemasters, one was in the Middle East and the other was undergoing maintenance at Amberley and could not be flown but was moved onto high ground and escaped damage. The deployment to Japan involved all three of the squadron's available C-17s, the fourth still being serviced at Amberley. On 11 May 2012, a C-17 flew an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> tank from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Base Darwin</a> to <a href="Shoalwater%20Bay">Shoalwater Bay</a> for a training exercise; it was the first time an RAAF Globemaster had airlifted an Abrams, which at 61 tonnes was among the largest single items the 70-tonne-capacity aircraft could carry. In November that year the squadron took delivery of its sixth Globemaster. It was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in March 2013, for its proficiency the previous year.
In September 2014, RAAF C-17s were used to airlift arms and munitions to forces in <a href="Kurds">Kurdish</a>-controlled northern Iraq following an offensive by <a href="ISIL">ISIL</a> militants. On 10 April 2015, Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> announced the purchase of two more C-17s, which would bring No. 36 Squadron's complement to eight aircraft. Concurrent with delivery of the new C-17s by year's end, No. 36 Squadron's facilities were to be improved, obviating the need for maintenance to take place in No. 33 Squadron hangars. Also on 10 April, the squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup a record seventh time, and the RAAF's Maintenance Trophy a record fourth time. Later the same month, an Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport of No. 33 Squadron carried out the RAAF's first in-flight refuelling of a No. 36 Squadron Globemaster. The Governor-General, <a href="Peter%20Cosgrove">Sir Peter Cosgrove</a>, presented the squadron with a new standard on 19 May; the old standard was laid up in Holy Trinity Chapel at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Williams</a>, Victoria. No. 36 Squadron was awarded the <a href="Meritorious%20Unit%20Citation">Meritorious Unit Citation</a> in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for "sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014".
