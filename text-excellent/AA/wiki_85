Bacteria

Bacteria (; common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) are a type of <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">biological cell</a>. They constitute a large <a href="domain%20%28biology%29">domain</a> of <a href="prokaryotic">prokaryotic</a> <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s. Typically a few <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s in length, bacteria have a <a href="Bacterial%20cell%20structure%23Cell%20morphology">number of shapes</a>, ranging from <a href="coccus">spheres</a> to <a href="bacillus%20%28shape%29">rods</a> and <a href="spiral%20bacteria">spirals</a>. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, and are present in most of its <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, <a href="Hot%20spring">acidic hot springs</a>, <a href="radioactive%20waste">radioactive waste</a>, and the deep portions of <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">Earth's crust</a>. Bacteria also live in <a href="symbiotic">symbiotic</a> and <a href="parasitic">parasitic</a> relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about half of the <a href="bacterial%20phyla">bacterial phyla</a> have species that can be <a href="microbiological%20culture">grown</a> in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is known as <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a>, a branch of <a href="microbiology">microbiology</a>.

There are typically 40 million bacterial <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a>. There are approximately 5×10 bacteria on Earth, forming a <a href="biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a> which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in many stages of the <a href="nutrient%20cycle">nutrient cycle</a> by recycling nutrients such as the <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fixation of nitrogen</a> from the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. The nutrient cycle includes the <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> of <a href="cadaver">dead bodies</a>; bacteria are responsible for the <a href="putrefaction">putrefaction</a> stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding <a href="hydrothermal%20vents">hydrothermal vents</a> and <a href="cold%20seeps">cold seeps</a>, <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a> bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as <a href="hydrogen%20sulphide">hydrogen sulphide</a> and <a href="methane">methane</a>, to energy. Data reported by researchers in October 2012 and published in March 2013 suggested that bacteria thrive in the <a href="Mariana%20Trench">Mariana Trench</a>, which, with a depth of up to 11 kilometres, is the deepest known part of the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, "You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are."

The famous notion that bacterial cells in the human body outnumber human cells by a factor of 10:1 has been debunked. There are approximately 39 trillion bacterial cells in the <a href="human%20microbiota">human microbiota</a> as personified by a "reference" 70 kg male 170 cm tall, whereas there are 30 trillion human <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> in the body. This means that although they do have the upper hand in actual numbers, it is only by 30%, and not 900%.

The largest number exist in the <a href="gut%20flora">gut flora</a>, and a large number on the <a href="skin">skin</a>. The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>, though many are <a href="probiotic">beneficial</a>, particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are <a href="pathogenic%20bacteria">pathogenic</a> and cause <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, including <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>, and <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are <a href="respiratory%20infection">respiratory infection</a>s, with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. In <a href="developed%20country">developed countries</a>, <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s are used to treat <a href="Infection">bacterial infections</a> and are also used in farming, making <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a> and the breakdown of <a href="oil%20spills">oil spills</a>, the production of <a href="cheese">cheese</a> and <a href="yogurt">yogurt</a> through <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a>, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.

Once regarded as <a href="plant">plant</a>s constituting the class "Schizomycetes", bacteria are now classified as <a href="prokaryotes">prokaryotes</a>. Unlike cells of animals and other <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, bacterial cells do not contain a <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> and rarely harbour <a href="cell%20membrane">membrane-bound</a> <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s. Although the term "bacteria" traditionally included all prokaryotes, the <a href="scientific%20classification">scientific classification</a> changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that <a href="evolution">evolved</a> from an <a href="last%20universal%20common%20ancestor">ancient common ancestor</a>. These <a href="domain%20%28biology%29">evolutionary domains</a> are called "Bacteria" and "<a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>".

The word "bacteria" is the plural of the <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> "", which is the <a href="Latinisation%20%28literature%29">latinisation</a> of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ("bakterion"), the diminutive of <a href="wikt%3A%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1">βακτηρία</a> ("bakteria"), meaning "staff, cane", because the first ones to be discovered were <a href="bacillus%20%28shape%29">rod-shaped</a>.

The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the <a href="Abiogenesis">first forms of life</a> to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago. For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. Although bacterial <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s exist, such as <a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s, their lack of distinctive <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a>, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. The <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of bacteria and archaea was probably a <a href="thermophile">hyperthermophile</a> that lived about 2.5 billion–3.2 billion years ago.

Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiotic</a> associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the <a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of <a href="alphaproteobacteria">alphaproteobacteria</a>l <a href="symbiosis">symbionts</a> to form either <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> or <a href="hydrogenosome">hydrogenosome</a>s, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly <a href="reduced%20form">reduced form</a>, e.g. in ancient "amitochondrial" protozoa). Later, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>-like organisms, leading to the formation of <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s in algae and plants. This is known as <a href="primary%20endosymbiosis">primary endosymbiosis</a>.

Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologies</a>. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, "<a href="Thiomargarita%20namibiensis">Thiomargarita namibiensis</a>" is up to half a millimetre long and "<a href="Epulopiscium%20fishelsoni">Epulopiscium fishelsoni</a>" reaches 0.7 mm. Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus "<a href="Mycoplasma">Mycoplasma</a>", which measure only 0.3 micrometres, as small as the largest <a href="virus">virus</a>es. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these <a href="ultramicrobacteria">ultramicrobacteria</a> are not well-studied.

Most bacterial species are either spherical, called "<a href="coccus">cocci</a>" ("sing". coccus, from Greek "kókkos", grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called "<a href="bacillus%20%28shape%29">bacilli</a>" ("sing". bacillus, from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "baculus", stick). Some bacteria, called "<a href="Spiral%20bacteria%23Vibrio">vibrio</a>", are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called "<a href="Spiral%20bacteria%23Spirillum">spirilla</a>", or tightly coiled, called "<a href="Spiral%20bacteria%23Spirochete">spirochaetes</a>". A small number of other unusual shapes have been described, such as star-shaped bacteria. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> and <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape <a href="predation">predators</a>.
Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: "<a href="Neisseria">Neisseria</a>" form diploids (pairs), "<a href="Streptococcus">Streptococcus</a>" form chains, and "<a href="Staphylococcus">Staphylococcus</a>" group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also group to form larger multicellular structures, such as the elongated <a href="filamentous%20bacteria">filaments</a> of "<a href="Actinobacteria">Actinobacteria</a>", the aggregates of "<a href="Myxobacteria">Myxobacteria</a>", and the complex hyphae of "<a href="Streptomyces">Streptomyces</a>". These multicellular structures are often only seen in certain conditions. For example, when starved of amino acids, <a href="Myxobacteria">Myxobacteria</a> detect surrounding cells in a process known as <a href="quorum%20sensing">quorum sensing</a>, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; for example, about one in ten cells migrate to the top of a fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.

Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called <a href="biofilm">biofilm</a>s, and larger formations known as <a href="microbial%20mat">microbial mat</a>s. These biofilms and mats can range from a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, <a href="protist">protist</a>s and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as <a href="microcolony">microcolonies</a>, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of <a href="implant%20%28medicine%29">implanted</a> <a href="medical%20device">medical device</a>s, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.

The bacterial cell is surrounded by a <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a> which is made primarily of <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, <a href="protein">protein</a>s and other essential components of the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> within the cell. Unlike <a href="eukaryote">eukaryotic cells</a>, bacteria usually lack large membrane-bound structures in their cytoplasm such as a <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>, <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells. However, some bacteria have protein-bound organelles in the cytoplasm which compartmentalize aspects of bacterial metabolism, such as the <a href="carboxysome">carboxysome</a>. Additionally, bacteria have a multi-component <a href="prokaryotic%20cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a> to control the localisation of proteins and nucleic acids within the cell, and to manage the process of <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>.

Many important <a href="biochemistry">biochemical</a> reactions, such as energy generation, occur due to <a href="diffusion">concentration gradients</a> across membranes, creating a <a href="Electrochemical%20potential">potential</a> difference analogous to a battery. The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means these reactions, such as <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport</a>, occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the outside of the cell or <a href="periplasm">periplasm</a>. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called <a href="chlorosome">chlorosome</a>s in <a href="green%20sulfur%20bacteria">green sulfur bacteria</a>.
Most bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their <a href="gene">gene</a>tic material is typically a single <a href="circular%20bacterial%20chromosome">circular bacterial chromosome</a> of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the <a href="nucleoid">nucleoid</a>. The nucleoid contains the <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> with its associated proteins and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. Like all <a href="Organism">living organisms</a>, bacteria contain <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s and <a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>.

Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules, such as <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a>, <a href="polyphosphate">polyphosphate</a>, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> or <a href="polyhydroxyalkanoates">polyhydroxyalkanoates</a>. Certain bacterial species, such as the <a href="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <a href="Cyanobacteria">Cyanobacteria</a>, produce internal <a href="Vacuole%23Bacteria">gas vacuoles</a> which they use to regulate their buoyancy, allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels.

Around the outside of the cell membrane is the <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>. Bacterial cell walls are made of <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> (also called murein), which is made from <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> chains cross-linked by <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s containing D-<a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="fungus">fungi</a>, which are made of <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="chitin">chitin</a>, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, that classify bacteria into <a href="gram-positive%20bacteria">gram-positive bacteria</a> and <a href="gram-negative%20bacteria">gram-negative bacteria</a>. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the <a href="Gram%20stain">Gram stain</a>, a long-standing test for the classification of bacterial species.

Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and <a href="teichoic%20acid">teichoic acid</a>s. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second <a href="Lipid%20bilayer">lipid membrane</a> containing <a href="lipopolysaccharide">lipopolysaccharide</a>s and <a href="lipoprotein">lipoprotein</a>s. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the <a href="Firmicutes">Firmicutes</a> and <a href="Actinobacteria">Actinobacteria</a> (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a> can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, such as "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>" or "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>". Some bacteria have cell wall structures that are neither classically gram-positive or gram-negative. This includes clinically important bacteria such as "<a href="Mycobacteria">Mycobacteria</a>" which have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall like a gram-positive bacterium, but also a second outer layer of lipids.

In many bacteria, an <a href="S-layer">S-layer</a> of rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a <a href="macromolecule">macromolecular</a> <a href="diffusion%20barrier">diffusion barrier</a>. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in "<a href="Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a>" and contain surface <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s in "<a href="Bacillus%20stearothermophilus">Bacillus stearothermophilus</a>".
<a href="Flagellum">Flagella</a> are rigid protein structures, about 20 nanometres in diameter and up to 20 micrometres in length, that are used for <a href="motility">motility</a>. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of <a href="ion">ion</a>s down an <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a> across the cell membrane.

<a href="Fimbria%20%28bacteriology%29">Fimbriae</a> (sometimes called "<a href="pilus%23Fimbriae">attachment pili</a>") are fine filaments of protein, usually 2–10 nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometres in length. They are distributed over the surface of the cell, and resemble fine hairs when seen under the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>. Fimbriae are believed to be involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells, and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. <a href="Pilus">Pili</a> ("sing". pilus) are cellular appendages, slightly larger than fimbriae, that can transfer <a href="genetic%20material">genetic material</a> between bacterial cells in a process called <a href="bacterial%20conjugation">conjugation</a> where they are called <a href="Pilus%23Conjugative%20pili">conjugation pili</a> or sex pili (see bacterial genetics, below). They can also generate movement where they are called <a href="pilus%23type%20iv%20pili">type IV pili</a>.

<a href="Glycocalyx%23Glycocalyx%20in%20Bacteria%20and%20Nature">Glycocalyx</a> is produced by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised <a href="slime%20layer">slime layer</a> of <a href="extracellular%20polymeric%20substance">extracellular polymeric substance</a>s to a highly structured <a href="bacterial%20capsule">capsule</a>. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s (part of the human <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>). They can also act as <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces and the formation of biofilms.

The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on <a href="bacterial%20secretion%20system">bacterial secretion system</a>s. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the <a href="virulence">virulence</a> of pathogens, so are intensively studied.

Certain <a href="Genus">genera</a> of gram-positive bacteria, such as "<a href="Bacillus">Bacillus</a>", "<a href="Clostridium">Clostridium</a>", "<a href="Sporohalobacter">Sporohalobacter</a>", "<a href="Anaerobacter">Anaerobacter</a>", and "<a href="Heliobacteria">Heliobacterium</a>", can form highly resistant, dormant structures called "<a href="endospore">endospore</a>s". Endospores develop within the cytoplasm of the cell; generally a single endospore develops in each cell. Each endospore contains a core of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by a multilayer rigid coat composed of peptidoglycan and a variety of proteins.

Endospores show no detectable <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses, such as high levels of <a href="ultraviolet">UV light</a>, <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma radiation</a>, <a href="detergent">detergent</a>s, <a href="disinfectant">disinfectant</a>s, heat, freezing, pressure, and <a href="desiccation">desiccation</a>. In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the <a href="Hard%20vacuum">vacuum</a> and radiation in space. Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> can be contracted by the inhalation of "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>" endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with "<a href="Clostridium%20tetani">Clostridium tetani</a>" endospores causes <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a>.

Bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of <a href="metabolism">metabolic</a> types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into <a href="primary%20nutritional%20groups">nutritional groups</a> on the basis of three major criteria: the source of <a href="Energy%20%28biology%29">energy</a>, the <a href="electron%20donor">electron donor</a>s used, and the source of <a href="carbon">carbon</a> used for growth.

Bacteria either derive energy from light using <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> (called <a href="phototrophy">phototrophy</a>), or by breaking down chemical compounds using <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> (called <a href="chemotroph">chemotroph</a>y). Chemotrophs use chemical compounds as a source of energy by transferring electrons from a given electron donor to a <a href="terminal%20electron%20acceptor">terminal electron acceptor</a> in a <a href="redox">redox reaction</a>. This reaction releases energy that can be used to drive metabolism. Chemotrophs are further divided by the types of compounds they use to transfer electrons. Bacteria that use inorganic compounds such as hydrogren, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> as <a href="electron%20donor">sources of electrons</a> are called <a href="lithotroph">lithotroph</a>s, while those that use organic compounds are called <a href="organotroph">organotroph</a>s. The compounds used to receive electrons are also used to classify bacteria: <a href="aerobic%20organism">aerobic organism</a>s use <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> as the terminal electron acceptor, while <a href="anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic organism</a>s use other compounds such as <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>, or carbon dioxide.

Many bacteria get their carbon from other <a href="organic%20compound">organic carbon</a>, called <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>y. Others such as <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> and some <a href="purple%20bacteria">purple bacteria</a> are <a href="autotroph">autotroph</a>ic, meaning that they obtain cellular carbon by <a href="Carbon%20fixation">fixing</a> <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. In unusual circumstances, the gas <a href="methane">methane</a> can be used by <a href="methanotroph">methanotroph</a>ic bacteria as both a source of <a href="electron">electron</a>s and a substrate for carbon <a href="anabolism">anabolism</a>.

In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">fix nitrogen</a> gas using the enzyme <a href="nitrogenase">nitrogenase</a>. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of <a href="denitrification">denitrification</a>, sulfate reduction, and <a href="acetogenesis">acetogenesis</a>, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to <a href="pollution">pollution</a>; for example, <a href="sulfate-reducing%20bacteria">sulfate-reducing bacteria</a> are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> (<a href="methylmercury">methyl-</a> and <a href="dimethylmercury">dimethylmercury</a>) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> in brewing) as waste. <a href="Facultative%20anaerobe">Facultative anaerobe</a>s can switch between fermentation and different <a href="terminal%20electron%20acceptor">terminal electron acceptor</a>s depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

Unlike in multicellular organisms, increases in cell size (<a href="cell%20growth">cell growth</a>) and reproduction by <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through <a href="binary%20fission">binary fission</a>, a form of <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual reproduction</a>. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8 minutes. In cell division, two identical <a href="clone%20%28genetics%29">clone</a> daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by "<a href="Myxobacteria">Myxobacteria</a>" and aerial <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e formation by "<a href="Streptomyces">Streptomyces</a>", or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.

In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid <a href="Growth%20medium">growth media</a>, such as <a href="agar%20plate">agar plate</a>s, are used to <a href="Isolation%20%28microbiology%29">isolate</a> pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.

Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see <a href="r/K%20selection%20theory">r/K selection theory</a>). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of <a href="algal%20bloom">algal</a> (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s by "<a href="Streptomyces">Streptomyces</a>" that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., <a href="biofilm">biofilm</a>s) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (<a href="syntrophy">syntrophy</a>).

<a href="Bacterial%20growth">Bacterial growth</a> follows four phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the <a href="Stationary%20phase%20%28biology%29">lag phase</a>, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the <a href="Stationary%20phase%20%28biology%29">logarithmic phase</a>, also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid <a href="exponential%20growth">exponential growth</a>. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the "growth rate" ("k"), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the "generation time" ("g"). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the "<a href="Stationary%20phase%20%28biology%29">stationary phase</a>" and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased <a href="gene%20expression">expression of genes</a> involved in <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a>, <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant metabolism</a> and <a href="active%20transport">nutrient transport</a>. The final phase is the <a href="Stationary%20phase%20%28biology%29">death phase</a> where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.

Most bacteria have a single circular <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> that can range in size from only 160,000 <a href="base%20pair">base pair</a>s in the <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiotic</a> bacteria "<a href="Candidatus%20Carsonella%20ruddii">Carsonella ruddii</a>", to 12,200,000 base pairs (12.2 Mbp) in the soil-dwelling bacteria "<a href="Sorangium%20cellulosum">Sorangium cellulosum</a>". There are many exceptions to this, for example some "<a href="Streptomyces">Streptomyces</a>" and "<a href="Borrelia">Borrelia</a>" species contain a single linear chromosome, while some "<a href="Vibrio">Vibrio</a>" species contain more than one chromosome. Bacteria can also contain <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>s, small extra-chromosomal DNAs that may contain genes for various useful functions such as <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a>, metabolic capabilities, or various <a href="virulence">virulence factors</a>.

Bacteria genomes usually encode a few hundred to a few thousand genes. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of <a href="intron">intron</a>s do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes.

Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit an identical copy of the parent's genomes and are <a href="Clonal%20colony">clonal</a>. However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material <a href="DNA">DNA</a> caused by <a href="genetic%20recombination">genetic recombination</a> or <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to <a href="mutagen">mutagen</a>s. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or "stress-directed mutation", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate.

Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called <a href="transformation%20%28genetics%29">transformation</a>. Many bacteria can <a href="natural%20competence">naturally</a> take up DNA from the environment, while others must be chemically altered in order to induce them to take up DNA. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells. The second way bacteria transfer genetic material is by <a href="transduction%20%28genetics%29">transduction</a>, when the integration of a <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a> introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and <a href="lytic%20cycle">lyse</a> their <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteria resist phage infection through <a href="restriction%20modification%20system">restriction modification system</a>s that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses <a href="CRISPR">CRISPR</a> sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a>. The third method of gene transfer is <a href="bacterial%20conjugation">conjugation</a>, whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact. In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a> and may be common under natural conditions.

Many bacteria are motile and can move using a variety of mechanisms. The best studied of these are <a href="Flagellum">flagella</a>, long filaments that are turned by a motor at the base to generate propeller-like movement. The bacterial flagellum is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a> across the membrane for power.
Bacteria can use flagella in different ways to generate different kinds of movement. Many bacteria (such as "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>") have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional <a href="random%20walk">random walk</a>. Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum ("<a href="Flagellum%23Flagellar%20arrangement%20schemes">monotrichous</a>"), a flagellum at each end ("<a href="Flagellum%23Flagellar%20arrangement%20schemes">amphitrichous</a>"), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell ("<a href="Flagellum%23Flagellar%20arrangement%20schemes">lophotrichous</a>"), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell ("<a href="Flagellum%23Flagellar%20arrangement%20schemes">peritrichous</a>"). The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the <a href="spirochaete">spirochaete</a>s, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive <a href="helix">helical</a> body that twists about as it moves.

Two other types of bacterial motion are called <a href="twitching%20motility">twitching motility</a> that relies on a structure called the <a href="pilus%23type%20iv%20pili">type IV pilus</a>, and <a href="Bacterial%20gliding">gliding motility</a>, that uses other mechanisms. In twitching motility, the rod-like pilus extends out from the cell, binds some substrate, and then retracts, pulling the cell forward.

Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain <a href="stimulus%20%28physiology%29">stimuli</a> in behaviours called <a href="taxis">taxes</a>: these include <a href="chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a>, <a href="phototaxis">phototaxis</a>, <a href="taxis">energy taxis</a>, and <a href="magnetotaxis">magnetotaxis</a>. In one peculiar group, the <a href="myxobacteria">myxobacteria</a>, individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The <a href="myxobacteria">myxobacteria</a> move only when on solid surfaces, unlike "E. coli", which is <a href="Motility">motile</a> in liquid or solid media.

Several "<a href="Listeria">Listeria</a>" and "<a href="Shigella">Shigella</a>" species move inside host cells by usurping the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, which is normally used to move <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s inside the cell. By promoting <a href="actin">actin</a> <a href="biopolymer">polymerisation</a> at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.

A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light. This <a href="bioluminescence">bioluminescence</a> often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.

Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as <a href="biofilms">biofilms</a>, exchanging a variety of molecular signals for <a href="Cell%20signaling">inter-cell communication</a>, and engaging in coordinated multicellular behaviour.

The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labour, accessing resources that cannot effectively be used by single cells, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimising population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types. For example, bacteria in biofilms can have more than 500 times increased resistance to <a href="Bactericide">antibacterial</a> agents than individual "planktonic" bacteria of the same species.

One type of inter-cellular communication by a molecular signal is called <a href="quorum%20sensing">quorum sensing</a>, which serves the purpose of determining whether there is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.

Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>, and enables them to produce, release and detect <a href="autoinducer">autoinducer</a>s or <a href="pheromones">pheromones</a> which accumulate with the growth in cell population.

<a href="Scientific%20classification">Classification</a> seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, <a href="Cell%20metabolism">cellular metabolism</a> or on differences in cell components, such as <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s, pigments, <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s and <a href="quinone">quinone</a>s. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as <a href="lateral%20gene%20transfer">lateral gene transfer</a> between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises <a href="molecular%20systematics">molecular systematics</a>, using genetic techniques such as <a href="guanine">guanine</a> <a href="cytosine">cytosine</a> <a href="GC-content">ratio</a> determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as <a href="DNA%20sequencing">sequencing</a> genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">rRNA gene</a>. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The <a href="International%20Committee%20on%20Systematic%20Bacteriology">International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology</a> (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20of%20Bacteria">International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria</a>.

The term "bacteria" was traditionally applied to all microscopic, single-cell prokaryotes. However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate <a href="domain%20%28biology%29">domains</a>, originally called "Eubacteria" and "Archaebacteria", but now called "Bacteria" and "<a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>" that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. The archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the <a href="three-domain%20system">three-domain system</a>, which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiology. However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid increase in the number of genome sequences that are available, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field. For example, a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from gram-positive bacteria.

The identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.

The "<a href="Gram%20stain">Gram stain</a>", developed in 1884 by <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Gram">Hans Christian Gram</a>, characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the "gram-positive" cell wall stain purple, while the thin "gram-negative" cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative cocci and gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or "Nocardia", which show <a href="acid-fast">acid-fast</a>ness on <a href="Ziehl-Neelsen%20stain">Ziehl–Neelsen</a> or similar stains. Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as <a href="serology">serology</a>.

<a href="Microbiological%20culture">Culture</a> techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens; for example, a <a href="sputum">sputum</a> sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, while <a href="feces">stool</a> specimens are cultured on <a href="selective%20media">selective media</a> to identify organisms that cause <a href="diarrhea">diarrhoea</a>, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as <a href="blood">blood</a>, <a href="urine">urine</a> or <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">spinal fluid</a>, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as <a href="aerobic%20organism">aerobic</a> or <a href="anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic</a> growth), <a href="hemolysis%20%28microbiology%29">patterns of hemolysis</a>, and staining.

As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a>, are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods. These methods also allow the detection and identification of "<a href="viable%20but%20nonculturable">viable but nonculturable</a>" cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing. However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty. Following present classification, there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes, which includes bacteria and archaea; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 10 to 10 total species—and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude.

Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. These <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> associations can be divided into <a href="parasitism">parasitism</a>, <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a> and <a href="commensalism">commensalism</a>. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and <a href="Perspiration">sweat</a>, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of <a href="body%20odor">body odour</a>.

Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called "predatory bacteria". These include organisms such as "<a href="Myxococcus%20xanthus">Myxococcus xanthus</a>", which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients, such as "<a href="Vampirovibrio%20chlorellavorus">Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus</a>", or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol, such as "Daptobacter". These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from <a href="Detritivore">saprophages</a> that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms.

Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of <a href="anaerobic%20bacteria">anaerobic bacteria</a> that consume <a href="organic%20acid">organic acid</a>s, such as <a href="butyric%20acid">butyric acid</a> or <a href="propionic%20acid">propionic acid</a>, and produce <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, and <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>ic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.

In soil, microorganisms that reside in the <a href="Rhizosphere%20%28ecology%29">rhizosphere</a> (a zone that includes the <a href="root">root</a> surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as <a href="symbiont">symbiont</a>s <a href="Bacteria%20in%20the%20human%20body">in humans</a> and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human <a href="gut%20flora">gut flora</a> of the <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s, such as <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a>, <a href="vitamin%20K">vitamin K</a> and <a href="biotin">biotin</a>, convert <a href="Milk%20protein">sugars</a> to <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a> (see "<a href="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a>"), as well as fermenting complex undigestible <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through <a href="competitive%20exclusion">competitive exclusion</a>) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as <a href="probiotic">probiotic</a> <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a>s.

If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a>, <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="foodborne%20illness">foodborne illness</a>, <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a> and <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with "<a href="Helicobacter%20pylori">Helicobacter pylori</a>" and <a href="Timeline%20of%20peptic%20ulcer%20disease%20and%20Helicobacter%20pylori">peptic ulcer disease</a>. Bacterial diseases are also important in <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, with bacteria causing <a href="leaf%20spot">leaf spot</a>, <a href="fire%20blight">fire blight</a> and <a href="Wilting">wilts</a> in plants, as well as <a href="Johne%27s%20disease">Johne's disease</a>, <a href="mastitis">mastitis</a>, <a href="salmonellosis">salmonella</a> and <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> in farm animals.

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human <a href="host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a>. Some organisms, such as "<a href="Staphylococcus">Staphylococcus</a>" or "<a href="Streptococcus">Streptococcus</a>", can cause skin infections, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> and even overwhelming <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>, a systemic <a href="Inflammation">inflammatory response</a> producing <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>, massive <a href="vasodilator">vasodilation</a> and death. Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the <a href="nose">nose</a> without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the <a href="Rickettsia">Rickettsia</a>, which are <a href="obligate%20intracellular%20parasite">obligate intracellular parasite</a>s able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, while another causes <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20spotted%20fever">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a>. "<a href="Chlamydia%20%28bacterium%29">Chlamydia</a>", another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a> and may be involved in <a href="coronary%20heart%20disease">coronary heart disease</a>. Finally, some species, such as "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>", "<a href="Burkholderia%20cenocepacia">Burkholderia cenocepacia</a>", and "<a href="Mycobacterium%20avium%20complex">Mycobacterium avium</a>", are <a href="opportunistic%20infection">opportunistic pathogens</a> and cause disease mainly in people suffering from <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a> or <a href="cystic%20fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>.

Bacterial infections may be treated with <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s, which are classified as <a href="Bactericide">bacteriocidal</a> if they kill bacteria, or <a href="bacteriostatic">bacteriostatic</a> if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibits</a> a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are <a href="chloramphenicol">chloramphenicol</a> and <a href="puromycin">puromycin</a>, which inhibit the bacterial <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a> to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a> measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also <a href="sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilised</a> to prevent contamination by bacteria. <a href="Disinfectant">Disinfectant</a>s such as <a href="bleach">bleach</a> are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.

Bacteria, often <a href="lactic%20acid%20bacteria">lactic acid bacteria</a>, such as "<a href="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a>" and "<a href="Lactococcus">Lactococcus</a>", in combination with <a href="yeast">yeast</a>s and <a href="mold">moulds</a>, have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermented</a> foods, such as <a href="cheese">cheese</a>, <a href="Pickling">pickles</a>, <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>, <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>, <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a>, <a href="wine">wine</a> and <a href="yogurt">yogurt</a>.

The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a>. Bacteria capable of digesting the <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s in <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> are often used to clean up <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">"Exxon Valdez" oil spill</a>. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> of industrial <a href="toxic%20waste">toxic waste</a>s. In the <a href="chemical%20industry">chemical industry</a>, bacteria are most important in the production of <a href="enantiomer">enantiomer</a>ically pure chemicals for use as <a href="pharmaceutical%20company">pharmaceuticals</a> or <a href="agrichemical">agrichemical</a>s.

Bacteria can also be used in the place of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s in the <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a>. This commonly involves "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>" (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>n-specific <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as <a href="environmentally%20friendly">environmentally friendly</a>, with little or no effect on humans, <a href="wildlife">wildlife</a>, <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s and most other <a href="beneficial%20insect">beneficial insect</a>s.

Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, <a href="genetics">genetics</a> and <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s and <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of <a href="enzyme%20kinetics">enzyme kinetic</a> and <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> data into <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a>s of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of "Escherichia coli" metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to <a href="bioengineering">bioengineer</a> bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, <a href="growth%20factor">growth factor</a>s, or <a href="antibody">antibodies</a>.

Because of their importance for research in general, samples of bacterial strains are isolated and preserved in <a href="Biological%20Resource%20Centers">Biological Resource Centers</a>. This ensures the availability of the strain to scientists worldwide.

Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist <a href="Antonie%20van%20Leeuwenhoek">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a> in 1676, using a single-lens <a href="microscope">microscope</a> of his own design. He then published his observations in a series of letters to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20London">Royal Society of London</a>. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, in one of the most striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would see them again for over a century. His observations had also included protozoans which he called <a href="animalcule">animalcule</a>s, and his findings were looked at again in the light of the more recent findings of <a href="cell%20theory">cell theory</a>.

<a href="Christian%20Gottfried%20Ehrenberg">Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg</a> introduced the word "bacterium" in 1828. In fact, his "<a href="Bacterium%20%28genus%29">Bacterium</a>" was a genus that contained non-spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria, as opposed to "Bacillus", a genus of spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria defined by Ehrenberg in 1835.

<a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> demonstrated in 1859 that the growth of microorganisms causes the <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> process, and that this growth is not due to <a href="spontaneous%20generation">spontaneous generation</a>. (<a href="Yeast">Yeast</a>s and <a href="mold">moulds</a>, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather <a href="fungus">fungi</a>.) Along with his contemporary <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a>, Pasteur was an early advocate of the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a>.

Robert Koch, a pioneer in medical microbiology, worked on <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> and <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize</a> in 1905. In "<a href="Koch%27s%20postulates">Koch's postulates</a>", he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a <a href="disease">disease</a>, and these postulates are still used today.

<a href="Ferdinand%20Cohn">Ferdinand Cohn</a> is said to be a founder of bacteriology, studying bacteria from 1870. Cohn was the first to classify bacteria based on their morphology.

Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective <a href="antiseptic">antibacterial</a> treatments were available. In 1910, <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a> developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained "<a href="Treponema%20pallidum">Treponema pallidum</a>"—the <a href="spirochaete">spirochaete</a> that causes <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the <a href="Gram%20stain">Gram stain</a> and the <a href="Ziehl%E2%80%93Neelsen%20stain">Ziehl–Neelsen stain</a>.

A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when <a href="Carl%20Woese">Carl Woese</a> recognised that <a href="archaea">archaea</a> have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> depended on the <a href="sequencing">sequencing</a> of <a href="16S%20ribosomal%20RNA">16S ribosomal RNA</a>, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the <a href="three-domain%20system">three-domain system</a>.

Trafford Park

Trafford Park is an area of the <a href="Trafford">Metropolitan Borough of Trafford</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England, opposite <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a> on the southern side of the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, southwest of <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a> and north of <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>. Until the late 19th century, it was the ancestral home of the <a href="Trafford%20%28surname%29">Trafford</a> family, who sold it to financier <a href="Ernest%20Terah%20Hooley">Ernest Terah Hooley</a> in 1896. Occupying an area of , it was the first planned <a href="industrial%20park">industrial estate</a> in the world, and remains the largest in Europe.

Trafford Park is almost entirely surrounded by water; the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, its northeastern and northwestern. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic, so in the early days the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. <a href="British%20Westinghouse">British Westinghouse</a> was the first major company to move in, and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000 workers then employed in the park, which became one of the most important engineering facilities in Britain.

Trafford Park was a major supplier of <a href="materiel">materiel</a> in the First and Second World Wars, producing the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> engines used to power both the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> and the <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a>. At its peak in 1945, an estimated 75,000 workers were employed in the park. Employment began to decline in the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. By 1967 employment had fallen to 50,000, and the decline continued throughout the 1970s. The new generation of container ships was too large for the Manchester Ship Canal, which led to a further decline in Trafford Park's fortunes. The workforce had fallen to 15,000 by 1976, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared from the park.

The Trafford Park Urban Development Corporation, formed in 1987, reversed the estate's decline. In the 11 years of its existence, the park attracted 1,000 companies, generating 28,299 new jobs and £1.759 billion of private-sector investment. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within Trafford Park, employing an estimated 35,000 people.

Until the industrial development of the park began in the late 19th century, much of the area now known as Trafford Park was a "beautifully timbered deer park". Its comprised flat meadows and grassland, and an inner park containing a tree-lined avenue leading from an entrance lodge at <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell">Barton-upon-Irwell</a>. It was the ancestral estate of the <a href="Trafford%20%28surname%29">de Trafford family</a>, one of the most ancient in England, and then one of the largest landowners in Stretford. The family acquired the lands around Trafford in about 1200, when Richard de Trafford was given the lordship of Stretford by <a href="Hamon%20de%20Massey">Hamon de Massey</a>, 4th Baron of Dunham. Some time between 1672 and 1720, the de Traffords moved from the home they had occupied since 1017, in what is now known as <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, to what was then called Whittleswick Hall, which they renamed Trafford Hall. Their new home was a little to the east of where Tenax Circle is today, at the northwestern end of Trafford Park Road.

Trafford Park contained the hall, its grounds, and three farms: Park Farm, Moss Farm, and Waters Meeting Farm. From the original three entrance lodges to the park, at Throstle Nest, Barton-upon-Irwell and <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, only the latter has survived, having been relocated from its original position opposite what is today the White City retail park to become the entrance to Gorse Hill Park.
In 1761, a section of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> was built along the southeast and southwest sides of Trafford Park. The canal along with the River Irwell, which marked the estate's northeast and northwest boundaries, gave the park its present-day "island-like" quality. In about 1860, an ornamental lake was dug in the north of the park, close to the River Irwell.

A meeting held in 1882 at the <a href="Didsbury">Didsbury</a> home of engineer <a href="Daniel%20Adamson">Daniel Adamson</a> began the estate's transformation, with the creation of the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> committee. <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20de%20Trafford">Sir Humphrey de Trafford</a> was an implacable opponent of the proposed canal, objecting that, amongst other things, it would bring polluted water close to his residence, interfere with his drainage, and render Trafford Hall uninhabitable, forcing him to "give up his home and leave the place". Despite Sir Humphrey's opposition the Ship Canal Bill became law on its third passage through Parliament, on 6 August 1885. Construction began in 1888, more than two years after Sir Humphrey's death, although a wall was built between the canal and the park, so as to block it off from view. Two wharves were also built, for the exclusive use of the de Traffords.

The opening of the ship canal in 1894 made Trafford Park a prime site for industrial development. During the following century, the park was built over with factories and some housing for workers. The deer were initially allowed to continue roaming free, but as the park's industrialisation gathered pace they were considered inappropriate and were killed, the last of them in 1900. Trafford Hall survived until its demolition following the Second World War.

On 7 May 1896, <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20de%20Trafford%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford</a> put the estate up for auction, but it failed to reach its reported reserve price of £300,000 (£ as of 2019). There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June <a href="Ernest%20Terah%20Hooley">Ernest Terah Hooley</a> became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£ as of 2019).

On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a <a href="racetrack">racetrack</a>, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for "all types of trade including timber". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with <a href="Marshall%20Stevens">Marshall Stevens</a>, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930.
The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to "Gentlemen only". The hall's stables and some other outbuildings were used for stock auctions and the sale of horses, from 1900 to 1902, and the ornamental lake was leased to William Crooke and Sons, for use as a boating lake, initially on a five-year lease. A <a href="polo">polo</a> ground was set up in the park in 1902, and of land near the hall were leased to the Manchester Golf Club, who laid out a three-mile (4.8 km) long course. The club moved from Trafford Park to a new site at Hopwood Park in 1912. All of the open-field land uses were subsequently pushed out by industry.

In 1908 the Estates Company decided to reverse its earlier policy of only leasing the land, and began to construct what were known as Hives, wide subdivisions of a longer single building that could be internally reconfigured for each tenant's needs. A series of 19 were built initially, available to rent at £80 per annum (£ as of ). <a href="Brooke%20Bond">Brooke Bond</a> was one of the companies that took advantage of the Hives, before moving to its purpose-built factory on the park in 1922. The Estates Company also built large reinforced concrete warehouses, known as Safes. These buildings were fitted with sprinkler systems and were considered fireproof, which reduced insurance costs to 25 per cent of those of comparable warehouses elsewhere in the area. Each Safe had a capacity of , sufficient to hold 50,000 bales of cotton.
Among the first industries to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power station in the park, on the banks of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>. Most of these early developments were built on the eastern side of the park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.

The first American company to arrive was <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse Electric</a>, which formed its British subsidiary – <a href="British%20Westinghouse">British Westinghouse Electric Company</a> – in 1899, and purchased on two sites. Building work started in 1900, and the factory began production of turbines and electric generators in 1902. By the following year, British Westinghouse was employing about half of the 12,000 workers in Trafford Park. Its main machine shop was long and wide; for almost 100 years Westinghouse's Trafford Park works was the most important engineering facility in Britain. In 1919, Westinghouse was sold to the <a href="Vickers%20Company">Vickers Company</a> and renamed <a href="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a>, often shortened to Metrovicks.

In 1903, the <a href="Cooperative%20Wholesale%20Society">Cooperative Wholesale Society</a> (CWS), bought land at Trafford Wharf and set up a large food-packing factory and a flour mill. Other companies arriving at about the same time included Kilverts (<a href="lard">lard</a> manufacturers), the Liverpool Warehousing Company, and Lancashire Dynamo & Crypto Ltd.
The second major American company to set up a <a href="Ford%20Trafford%20Park%20Factory">manufacturing base in Trafford Park</a> was the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, in 1911. Initially Ford used its factory as an assembly plant for the <a href="Model%20T">Model T</a>, although other vehicles were assembled there in later years, before moving to a <a href="Ford%20Dagenham">new factory</a> at <a href="Dagenham">Dagenham</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, in 1931. By 1915, 100 American companies had moved into the park, peaking at more than 200 by 1933. When the cotton industry began to decline in the early 20th century, Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal helped Manchester – and to a lesser extent the rest of south Lancashire – to weather the economic depression from which the rest of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> suffered. During the First World War the park was used for the manufacture of munitions, chemicals and other materiel. Most firms at Trafford Park succeeded in avoiding bankruptcy during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, unlike the rest of Lancashire. Ford moved to Dagenham in 1931, but returned temporarily to Trafford Park during the Second World War.

Metropolitan Vickers set up Manchester's and one of the UK's first radio stations at their factory in 1921. The station's first broadcast took place on 17 May 1922. In October that year the company was one of six who formed the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Company</a> (BBC), which started broadcasting from the Metrovicks studio under the call sign <a href="2ZY">2ZY</a> on 15 November 1922. Much of the station's content was musical, but news, plays, and children's programmes were also transmitted. Conditions in the small studio were cramped, and the BBC moved the station to larger premises outside the park in 1923.

Sir Humphrey de Trafford had retained of land on the western side of the ship canal after his 1897 sale of Trafford Park. Hemmed in as it was between the canals and "an increasingly urbanised Stretford to the east", as the industrialisation of the park neared its completion the Estates Company started to acquire parcels of the remaining de Trafford land, then in the control of family trustees, as did the Canal Company. In 1924 the Estates Company bought a half share in Dumplington Estates Ltd., a company set up to administer of land bought from the de Trafford Trustees on which it was intended to build a garden village. In 1929 the Ship Canal Company acquired Dumplington Estates, and in return gave the Estates Company land to the south of Barton, the Trafford Park Extension. The Canal Company recognised the potential for a new dock on the land, giving the area its name of Barton Dock Estate, although no dock was ever built. The Barton Docks area was developed during and after the Second World War, but the land belonging to Dumplington Estates remained largely undeveloped until the construction of the <a href="Trafford%20Centre">Trafford Centre</a>, which opened in 1998.

Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war <a href="materiel">materiel</a> during the Second World War, such as the <a href="Avro%20Manchester">Avro Manchester</a> and <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers, and the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> engines used to power the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>, <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hurricane</a>, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 <a href="Percival%20Proctor">Percival Proctor</a> aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby <a href="Barton%20Aerodrome">Barton Aerodrome</a>. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill tank</a>s, munitions, <a href="Bailey%20Bridge">Bailey Bridge</a>s, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> in quantity.

As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the <a href="Manchester%20Blitz">Manchester Blitz</a> of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.

In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> football stadium, the nearby home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>, the stadium of <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in <a href="Moss%20Side">Moss Side</a>.

At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were an estimated 50,000 workers employed in the park. By the end of the war in 1945 that number had risen to 75,000, probably the peak size of the park's workforce; Metropolitan-Vickers alone employed 26,000.

In the 1960s employment in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. <a href="Ellesmere%20Port">Ellesmere Port</a> and <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a> at the western end of the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.

On 12 August 1981, of Trafford Park – along with <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a> – were declared an <a href="Enterprise%20Zone">Enterprise Zone</a> by the UK government, in an attempt to encourage new development within the estate. The new status did little to reverse the park's fortunes however; during a 1984 <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> debate, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>, <a href="Tony%20Lloyd">Tony Lloyd</a>, described the area's decline as "spectacular and disastrous". The target had been to create 7,000 new jobs over 10 years, but by 1986 only 2,557 had been created, not even enough to compensate for the ongoing job losses caused by closures within the park. On 10 February 1987 the <a href="Trafford%20Park%20Development%20Corporation">Trafford Park Development Corporation</a> was formed to assume responsibility for a Urban Development Area that included not only Trafford Park but also parts of Stretford, Salford Quays, and the former steelworks at <a href="Irlam">Irlam</a>, now known as Northbank. Of the four redevelopment schemes undertaken by the corporation one, Wharfside, included of the eastern end of the park as well as part of the ship canal docks and the area around <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a>'s <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> football ground to the east of the Bridgewater Canal. The intention was to build "a flagship site" containing prestigious accommodation for offices, shops, and "hi-tech" industries, capitalising on the area's proximity to Manchester city centre and mirroring the earlier success of the redevelopment at nearby Salford Quays.

Between 1987 and 1998, the <a href="development%20corporation">development corporation</a> attracted 1,000 companies, generating 28,299 new jobs and £1.759 billion of private sector investment. The setting up of the corporation was intended to be only a temporary measure, terminating on 31 March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.

The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of <a href="Stretford%20Urban%20District">Stretford Urban District</a>; the west was controlled by the urban district of <a href="Barton-upon-Irwell">Barton-upon-Irwell</a>. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a>, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.

In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">UDC</a>, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Council">Lancashire County Council</a> opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Pevsner</a> wrote: "That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England."

The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">ward</a>, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include the western part of the park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.

As a consequence of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the borough of Stretford was abolished and Trafford Park has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the <a href="Trafford">Metropolitan Borough of Trafford</a>. As of 2010, the park is in the Trafford ward of Gorse Hill.

Since 1997, Trafford Park has been in the <a href="Stretford%20and%20Urmston%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">constituency of Stretford and Urmston</a>. <a href="Kate%20Green">Kate Green</a>, a member of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, became the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 General Election</a>, with a majority of 8935, representing 48.6 per cent of the vote. The <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> took 28.7 per cent of the vote, the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> 16.9 per cent, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party">United Kingdom Independence Party</a> 3.4 per cent, the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party</a> 2.0 per cent, and the <a href="Christian%20Party%20%28UK%29">Christian Party</a> 0.4 per cent.

The <a href="topography">topography</a> of Trafford Park is either flat or gently undulating, about above sea level at its highest point. The local bedrock is <a href="Bunter%20%28geology%29">Triassic Bunter Sandstone</a>, overlaid by sand and gravel deposited during the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, around 10,000 years ago. There are some areas of <a href="bog">peat bog</a> in the west of the park, in the area formerly known as Trafford Moss. In 1793, <a href="William%20Roscoe">William Roscoe</a> began work on reclaiming the bog, and by 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for him to turn his attention to the task of reclaiming the much larger <a href="Chat%20Moss">Chat Moss</a> in nearby Salford, also owned by the Trafford family.

The park occupies an area of , and is almost entirely surrounded by water. The <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal forms its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Trafford Park is the most northerly area of Trafford, and faces <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a> across the Manchester Ship Canal. Stretford lies to the south and east, and <a href="Urmston">Urmston</a> to the west.

In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west.
The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three <a href="tin%20tabernacle">corrugated iron churches</a> were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (<a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>) in 1902, and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as <a href="slum">slum</a>s in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.

The <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum%20North">Imperial War Museum North</a>, opened on 5 July 2002, is in Trafford Wharf, on the southern edge of the ship canal looking over towards <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a>. An example of <a href="Deconstructivism">deconstructivist architecture</a>, it was the first building in the United Kingdom to be designed by <a href="Daniel%20Libeskind">Daniel Libeskind</a>. The structure consists of three interlocking sections: the air shard, the earth shard, and the water shard, representing a world torn apart by conflict. Entrance to the museum is via the air shard, which is in height, and is open to the elements. It has a viewing platform about high, offering views across <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a> and the Quays towards Manchester city centre. The museum houses two extensive exhibition spaces. The largest is dedicated to the permanent exhibition covering conflicts from 1900 to the present day, and the other space is used for special exhibitions.

Trafford Ecology Park

The <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130805132532/http%3A//www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/manchester-salford-stockport/our-services/trafford-ecology-park.aspx">Trafford Ecology Park</a> is what remains of Trafford Park's ornamental boating lake. Boating continued on the lake until the 1930s, but by then its water had become polluted by asbestos and oil seepage from the neighbouring Anglo American Oil depot. During the Second World War the site was used as a tip for foundry waste. <a href="Esso">Esso</a> bought the land in 1974, and levelled and partly seeded it, to improve the frontage to its own site. Trafford council bought the land from Esso in 1983, for £50,000 (£ as of 2019). Government spending restrictions delayed the park's restoration and conversion, and it was not fully opened to the public until 1990.

The present lake is about one-third of its original size, but although now relatively small it supports a wide variety of wildlife, including foxes, weasels, rabbits, hedgehogs, lapwings, kestrels, herons, coot, Canada Geese, and several varieties of newt. In 2007 the park was designated a <a href="Local%20Nature%20Reserve">Local Nature Reserve</a>, one of only two in Trafford.

The site was originally part of the de Trafford family estate, but was enveloped by encroaching industry in the early 1900s.
In the following years the area was used as a tipping site by industry and partly filled with construction rubble and slag from steel works. Now owned and managed by Groundwork Manchester, Salford, Stockport, Tameside & Trafford, the park is used as a training centre for horticulture training and as a volunteering hub.

At the end of the 19th century there were no public transport routes in, and few running close to, Trafford Park. Its size meant that the Estates Company was obliged to provide some means of travelling around the park, and therefore a gas-powered <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> was commissioned, intended to carry both people and freight. The first tram ran on 23 July 1897, but after a few days of operation there was an accident in which a tramcar was derailed, and the service was suspended until the following year. The tram's maximum speed was , and their distinctive exhaust smell quickly earned them the nickname "Lamp Oil Express". The service was operated by the <a href="British%20Gas%20Traction%20Company">British Gas Traction Company</a>, which paid a share of its takings to the Estates Company, but by 1899 the company was in serious financial difficulty, and entered voluntary liquidation. Salford Corporation then refused to provide any more gas for the trams, and the service was once again suspended until the Estates Company bought the entire operation for £2,000 in 1900. A separate electric tramway was installed in 1903, and was taken over and operated by Manchester and Salford Corporations in 1905. The takeover did not affect the gas trams however, which continued to run until 1908, when they were replaced by steam locomotives. Between 1904 and 1907 the Estates Company also operated a horse-drawn bus for the use of gentlemen staying at Trafford Hall, then a hotel. The service, available 24-hours a day, was replaced by a motor car in 1907.
Under an 1898 agreement between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and to the construction of a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, as a result of the Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. The network was also connected to the <a href="Manchester%2C%20South%20Junction%20and%20Altrincham%20Railway">Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway</a> near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26 route miles (42 km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.

<a href="Trafford%20Park%20Aerodrome%20%28Manchester%29">Trafford Park Aerodrome</a> was Manchester's first purpose-built airfield, laid out on a site between Trafford Park Road, Mosley Road, and Ashburton Road. The first aircraft landed there on 7 July 1911, flown from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> by Henry G. Melly. The aerodrome was in use until the early years of the First World War, and possibly until 1918, when it was replaced by the newly completed <a href="Alexandra%20Park%20Aerodrome">Alexandra Park Aerodrome</a>.

The Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, which has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year, was opened in 1993, at a cost of £11 million.

Today, Trafford Park is served by a number of bus routes including the <a href="Stagecoach%20Manchester">Stagecoach Manchester</a> X50 and 250 which run between Manchester city centre and the Trafford Centre. <a href="Trafford%20Park%20railway%20station">Trafford Park railway station</a> is to the east of the area and is served by trains between <a href="Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station">Liverpool Lime Street</a> and <a href="Manchester%20Oxford%20Road%20railway%20station">Manchester Oxford Road</a>.

The new <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> line from Pomona to the Trafford Centre is under construction. The <a href="Trafford%20Park%20Line">Trafford Park Line</a> will have stops at <a href="Wharfside%20tram%20stop">Wharfside</a>, <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum%20tram%20stop">Imperial War Museum North</a>, <a href="Village%20tram%20stop">Village</a>, <a href="Parkway%20tram%20stop">Parkway</a>, <a href="EventCity%20tram%20stop">EventCity</a> and the <a href="Trafford%20Centre%20tram%20stop">Trafford Centre</a>.

Yugoslav destroyer Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik was a <a href="flotilla%20leader">flotilla leader</a> built for the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> by <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> in 1930 and 1931. She was one of the largest <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s of her time. Resembling contemporary British designs, "Dubrovnik" was a fast ship with a main armament of four <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovak</a>-built <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> guns in single mounts. She was intended to be the first of three flotilla leaders built for Yugoslavia, but was the only one completed. During her service with the Royal Yugoslav Navy, "Dubrovnik" undertook several peacetime cruises through the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a> and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. In October 1934, she conveyed <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">King Alexander</a> to France for a <a href="state%20visit">state visit</a>, and carried his body back to Yugoslavia following his assassination in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>.

During the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, "Dubrovnik" was captured by the Italians. After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mainmast</a> and <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a>, she was commissioned into the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport. In June 1942, she was part of the Italian force that attacked the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">Operation Harpoon</a> convoy attempting to relieve the island of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. In July 1943, she broke down and was brought to <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> for repair and a refit. "Premuda" was the most important and effective Italian <a href="Prize%20%28law%29">war prize</a> ship of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

At the time of the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Italian surrender</a> to the Allies in September 1943, "Premuda" was still docked in Genoa, and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert her into a <a href="radar%20picket">radar picket</a> for <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s were abandoned. In August 1944, following the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a> as a "<a href="Torpedoboot%20Ausland">Torpedoboot Ausland</a>" (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. In March 1945, she took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ligurian%20Sea">Battle of the Ligurian Sea</a> against two <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> destroyers, during which she was lightly damaged. She was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> the following month as the Germans retreated from Genoa.

Following the demise of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> and the subsequent creation of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS), Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> to the new nation. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.

During the 1920s, many navies were pursuing the <a href="flotilla%20leader">flotilla leader</a> concept, building large <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s similar to the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="V%20and%20W-class%20destroyer">V and W-class destroyer</a>s. In the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar</a> <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>, these ships were known as "contre-torpilleurs", and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> of the <a href="Condottieri-class%20cruiser">"Condottieri" class</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Navy of the KSCS</a> decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would have the ability to reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships.

At the time the decision was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order the guns from the <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovak</a> firm <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a>. The initial Yarrow design was based on an enlarged version of the British <a href="Thornycroft%20type%20destroyer%20leader">"Shakespeare" class</a>, with five <a href="Skoda%2014%20cm/56%20naval%20gun">Skoda 14 cm/56 naval gun</a>s. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns, to be replaced with a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> mounting. The final version replaced the seaplane mounting with improved <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> armament.

The intention to build three flotilla leaders was demonstrated by the fact that Yarrow ordered a total of 12 Škoda guns, four per ship. In July or August 1929, the KSCS (which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October) signed a contract with Yarrow for a destroyer named "Dubrovnik". This was the only ship built; the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> prevented the construction of the rest of the planned half-flotilla.

"Dubrovnik" was similar in many respects to the British destroyers being manufactured at the same time, having a square box-like <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>, a long <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, and a sharp raked <a href="stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a> similar to the later British <a href="Tribal-class%20destroyer%20%281936%29">Tribal class</a>. Her rounded <a href="stern">stern</a> was adapted for <a href="minelaying">minelaying</a>. She had an <a href="overall%20length">overall length</a> of , with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a>, a mean <a href="Draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of , and a maximum draught of . Her <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> was , and at full load.

"Dubrovnik" had two <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the turbines was provided by three <a href="Yarrow%20water-tube%20boiler">Yarrow water-tube boiler</a>s, located in separate <a href="boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler room</a>s, and the turbines were rated at . As designed, the ship had a maximum speed of . In 1934, under ideal conditions, she achieved a maximum speed of . A separate <a href="Curtis%20turbine">Curtis turbine</a>, rated at , was installed for cruising, with which she could achieve a range of at . She carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>.

The ship's main armament consisted of four Škoda L/56 <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> guns in single mounts, two forward of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and two <a href="aft">aft</a>. She was also equipped with two triple Brotherhoods <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s on her centreline. For air defence, "Dubrovnik" had twin-mounted Škoda <a href="8.35%20cm%20PL%20kanon%20vz.%2022"></a> L/35 guns located on the centreline between the two sets of torpedo tubes, and six Škoda <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun"></a> L/67 anti-aircraft guns, arranged in two twin mounts and two single mounts. The twin mounts were located between the two funnels, with the single mounts on the main deck abreast the aft control station. For anti-submarine work she was equipped with two <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> throwers and two depth charge rails, and carried ten depth charges. She also carried two Škoda <a href="ZB%20vz.60"></a> <a href="machine%20guns">machine guns</a> and 40 <a href="Naval%20mine">mine</a>s. Her crew comprised 20 officers and 220 <a href="Naval%20rating">ratings</a>.

She was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 10 June 1930 and <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 11 October 1931. She was named after the former city-state and Yugoslav port of <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>.

"Dubrovnik" was completed at the Yarrow shipyards in Glasgow in 1932, by which time her main guns and light anti-aircraft guns had been installed. After sailing to the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a> in the southern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>, she was fitted with her heavy anti-aircraft guns. She was commissioned with the Royal Yugoslav Navy in May 1932. Her <a href="commanding%20officer">captain</a> was Armin Pavić.

In late September 1933, the ship left the Bay of Kotor and sailed through the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a> to <a href="Constan%C8%9Ba">Constanța</a> on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, where she embarked <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">King Alexander</a> and <a href="Maria%20of%20Yugoslavia">Queen Maria</a> of Yugoslavia. She then visited <a href="Balchik">Balcic</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Varna">Varna</a> in Bulgaria, before returning via <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and the Greek island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> in the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, arriving back at the Bay of Kotor on 8 October. On 6 October 1934, King Alexander left the Bay of Kotor on board "Dubrovnik" for a state visit to France, arriving in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> on 9 October. He was killed the same day by a Bulgarian assassin, and "Dubrovnik" conveyed his body back to Yugoslavia, escorted by French, Italian and British ships. Soon after, Vladimir Šaškijević replaced Pavić as captain. In August 1935, "Dubrovnik" visited Corfu and <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a> in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>. In August 1937, "Dubrovnik" visited Istanbul and the Greek ports of <a href="Moudros">Mudros</a> in the northern <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> near <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. 

Despite trying to remain neutral in the early stages of the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Yugoslavia was drawn into the conflict in April 1941, when it was <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded</a> by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>. At the time, "Dubrovnik" was still under Šaškijević's command and was assigned as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the 1st Torpedo Division, along with the three smaller <a href="Beograd-class%20destroyer">"Beograd"-class destroyers</a>, , and .

The Italians captured "Dubrovnik" in the Bay of Kotor on 17 April 1941; she had been damaged by Yugoslav civilians prior to her seizure. "Dubrovnik" was sailed to <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> in <a href="southern%20Italy">southern Italy</a> on 21 May, where she underwent repairs and a refit. She was renamed "<a href="Premuda">Premuda</a>", after the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n island near which an Italian <a href="MAS%20%28boat%29">motor torpedo boat</a> had sunk the Austro-Hungarian <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> in June 1918. Her aft deckhouse and emergency bridge were removed and replaced with an anti-aircraft platform, and her <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mainmast</a> and <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> were shortened. Her four single mount Škoda L/56 guns were replaced by four single mount <a href="135%20mm%20/45%20Italian%20naval%20gun">135 mm L/45 guns</a> and her twin Škoda L/55 anti-aircraft guns were replaced by a L/15 <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> firing <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a>s for illumination, while the six Škoda L/67 anti-aircraft guns were replaced by four <a href="Breda%20Model%2035">Breda Model 35</a> L/65 machine guns in single mounts, space for the latter being made available by removing her searchlights. A new <a href="Director%20%28military%29">director</a> was also fitted to her bridge. Later in her Italian service, the howitzer was replaced by a twin Breda <a href="Cannone-Mitragliera%20da%2037/54%20%28Breda%29">L/54</a> anti-aircraft gun mount. Under the Italian flag, her crew consisted of 13 officers and 191 enlisted ranks.

"Premuda" was commissioned in the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian Navy</a> () in February 1942. Later that month she rescued British <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> who survived the sinking of the , an Italian ship ferrying them from <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. In early June, the <a href="Italian%20submarine%20Alagi">Italian submarine Alagi</a> fired on "Premuda", mistaking her for a British destroyer owing to her similarities with a British <a href="G%20and%20H-class%20destroyer">H-class destroyer</a>. The attack missed "Premuda" and struck the <a href="Navigatori-class%20destroyer">"Navigatori"-class destroyer</a> , sinking her. During 12–16 June 1942, "Premuda" took part in operations against the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">Operation Harpoon</a> convoy attempting to reach the beleaguered island of Malta from <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. As part of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, "Premuda" supported the Italian 7th Cruiser Squadron, comprising the light cruisers and . The Allied naval force lost two destroyers and four merchant ships to a combination of naval gunfire, torpedoes, air attacks, and naval mines. The "Navigatori"-class destroyer was hit by a British destroyer, and "Premuda" was tasked to tow her to safety in the harbour of <a href="Pantelleria">Pantelleria</a>, an island in the <a href="Strait%20of%20Sicily">Strait of Sicily</a>, under escort from the destroyer .

On 6–7 January 1943, "Premuda" and 13 other Italian destroyers transported troops to the Axis-held port of <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. They completed two more such missions between 9 February and 22 March. On 17 July, "Premuda" developed serious engine problems in the <a href="Ligurian%20Sea">Ligurian Sea</a> near <a href="La%20Spezia">La Spezia</a>. She was subsequently brought to <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> for a major boiler and engine overhaul. It was decided to rebuild her along the lines of the "Navigatori"-class, including a wider beam to improve her stability. As shells for her Škoda-built main guns were in short supply, the decision was made to replace them with Italian-made /L45 guns in single mounts. The rebuild was also to have included augmented 37 mm and 20 mm armament, probably using space made available by removing her aft torpedo tubes. The rebuild had not been completed when <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Italy surrendered</a> to the Allies, and "Premuda" was seized by Germany at Genoa on 8 or 9 September 1943. "Premuda" was the most important and effective Italian <a href="Prize%20%28law%29">war prize</a> ship of World War II.

"Premuda"'s new guns had not been completed when she was captured by the Germans. Their initial plans called for the ship to serve as a <a href="radar%20picket">radar picket</a> for <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s, with three <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun"></a> L/45 anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, <a href="Freya%20radar">Freya</a> <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>, <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg%20radar">Würzburg</a> <a href="gun-laying">gun-laying</a> <a href="radar">radar</a> and a FuMO 21 surface <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>. These plans were soon abandoned because the Germans lacked destroyers and torpedo boats in the Mediterranean, and the decision was made to commission her as a "<a href="Torpedoboot%20Ausland">Torpedoboot Ausland</a>" (foreign torpedo boat) with a <a href="Seetakt%20radar">DeTe</a> radar instead of the Freya and Würzburg radar sets. Her armament was replaced with four L/45 naval guns, eight <a href="3.7%20cm%20Flak%2018/36/37/43"></a> anti-aircraft guns and between thirty-two and thirty-six <a href="2%20cm%20Flak%2030/38/Flakvierling"></a> anti-aircraft guns in quadruple and twin mounts. The number of torpedo tubes was reduced from six to three. The number of anti-aircraft guns was later increased to ten, in four twin and two single mounts. In German service, she had a total crew of 220 officers and men.
The ship was commissioned in the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a> () on 18 August 1944, as "TA32", under the command of "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant">Kapitänleutnant</a>" Emil Kopka. She served in the Ligurian Sea with the 10th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, and was immediately committed to shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast, then scouting and minelaying tasks in the western <a href="Gulf%20of%20Genoa">Gulf of Genoa</a>. On 2 October 1944, "TA32", along with and , sailed towards <a href="Sanremo">Sanremo</a> to lay mines, where they encountered the destroyer . After exchanging fire, the three ships returned to Genoa without being hit. By mid-March 1945, "TA32", "TA24" and "TA29" were the only ships of the 10th Torpedo Boat Flotilla that remained operational. On the night of 17/18 March 1945, "TA32" placed 76 naval mines off <a href="Cap%20Corse">Cap Corse</a>, the northern tip of <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, in an offensive minelaying operation, along with "TA24" and "TA29". After being detected by a shore-based radar, the ships were engaged by the destroyers and , in what would become known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ligurian%20Sea">Battle of the Ligurian Sea</a>. Outgunned, "TA24" and "TA29" were sunk, while "TA32" managed to escape with light damage to her rudder, after firing a few rounds and making an abortive torpedo attack. "TA32" was <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a> at Genoa on 24 April 1945 as the Germans retreated. Her wreck was raised and <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up</a> in 1950.

Beograd-class destroyer

The "Beograd" class of <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s consisted of three ships built for the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> in the late 1930s, to a French design. was constructed in France and and were built in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>. During the German-led Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, "Zagreb" was <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> to prevent its capture, and the other two were captured by the Italians. The <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> operated the two captured ships as <a href="convoy">convoy</a> escorts between Italy, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. One was lost in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tunis">Gulf of Tunis</a> in April 1943; the other was seized by the Germans in September 1943 after the Italian surrender and was subsequently operated by the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. There are conflicting reports about the fate of the last ship, but it was lost in the final weeks of the war.

In 1967, a French film was made about the scuttling of "Zagreb". In 1973, the <a href="President%20of%20Yugoslavia">President of Yugoslavia</a> and wartime <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisan</a> leader <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> posthumously awarded the two officers who scuttled "Zagreb" with the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Hero">Order of the People's Hero</a>.

Following the demise of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> at the conclusion of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS) was created. Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> to the new nation. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, and it had to build its naval forces almost from scratch.

The name of the state was changed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. In the early 1930s, the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">Royal Yugoslav Navy</a> (, KJRM) pursued the <a href="flotilla%20leader">flotilla leader</a> concept, which involved building large <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s similar to the World War I <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="V%20and%20W-class%20destroyer">V and W-class destroyer</a>s. In the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar</a> <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>, these ships were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The Royal Yugoslav Navy decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that could reach high speeds and would have long endurance. The endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships to the central <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships. This resulted in the construction of the destroyer in 1930–1931. Soon after she was ordered, the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> meant that only one ship of the planned half-flotilla was ever built.

Despite the fact that three large destroyers were not going to be built, the idea that "Dubrovnik" might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a <a href="division%20%28naval%29">division</a> led by "Dubrovnik". The "Beograd" class was developed from a French design, and the <a href="name%20ship">name ship</a> of the class, , was built by "<a href="Ateliers%20et%20Chantiers%20de%20la%20Loire">Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire</a>" at <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a>, France, whereas the remaining ships of the class, and , were built by "<a href="Brodosplit">Jadranska brodogradilišta</a>" at <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a>, Yugoslavia, under French supervision. Two more ships of the class were planned, but not built.

The ships had an <a href="Length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . Their standard <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> was , increasing to at full load. "Beograd" was powered by Curtis <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, and "Zagreb" and "Ljubljana" used <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> steam turbines. Regardless of the turbines used, they drove two propellors, using steam generated by three <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. Their turbines were rated at and they were designed to propel the ships at a top speed of , although they were only able to reach a practical top speed of in service. They carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave them a radius of action of . Their crews consisted of 145 personnel, including officers and enlisted men.

Main armament consisted of four <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> L/46 <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> guns in single mounts, two <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">forward</a> of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and two <a href="aft">aft</a>, protected by <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. Secondary armament consisted of four <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft gun</a>s in two twin mounts, located on either side of the aft shelter deck. The ships were also equipped with two triple mounts of <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a> and two <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s. Their <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s were provided by the Dutch firm of Hazemayer. As built, they could also carry 30 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s.

At the time of the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in September 1939, only two of the ships had been <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a>, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by "Beograd" in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's <a href="gold%20reserve">gold reserve</a> to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, "Ljubljana" ran into a <a href="reef">reef</a> off the Yugoslav port of <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a>. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.

When Yugoslavia was drawn into the war by the <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">German-led Axis invasion</a> on 6 April 1941, "Beograd" and "Zagreb" were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a> along with "Dubrovnik", but "Ljubljana" was still under repair at Šibenik. On 9 April, "Beograd" and other vessels were tasked with supporting an attack on the Italian enclave of <a href="Zadar">Zara</a> on the <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast, but the naval prong of the attack was aborted when "Beograd" suffered engine damage from near misses by Italian aircraft. She returned to the Bay of Kotor for repairs. "Beograd" and "Ljubljana" were captured in port by Italian forces on 17 April, but on the same day, two of "Zagreb"'s officers <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> her to prevent her capture, and were killed by the resulting explosions.

In Italian service, "Beograd" and "Ljubljana" were repaired, re-armed, and renamed "Sebenico" and "Lubiana" respectively. "Sebenico" was commissioned into the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> in August 1941, and "Lubiana" in October or November 1942. They both served mainly as <a href="convoy">convoy</a> escorts between Italy and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, with "Sebenico" completing more than 100 convoy escort missions over a two-year period. Neither ship was involved in any notable action. On 1 April 1943, "Lubiana" was either sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft, or <a href="Ship%20grounding">ran aground</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tunis">Gulf of Tunis</a> and was lost. "Sebenico" was captured by the Germans in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> after the <a href="Italian%20Armistice">Italian Armistice</a> in September 1943 in a damaged condition. She was repaired, re-armed, and renamed "TA43" and entered service in the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" (German Navy). "TA43" served on escort and <a href="minelayer">mine-laying</a> duties in the northern <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, but saw little action. One source states that she was damaged by artillery fire on 30 April 1945 at <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> and then scuttled, with others suggesting she was scuttled on 1 May.

In 1967, a French film, "<a href="Adriatic%20Sea%20of%20Fire">Flammes sur l'Adriatique</a>" (Adriatic Sea of Fire) was made, portraying the scuttling of "Zagreb" and the events leading up to it. In 1973, the <a href="President%20of%20Yugoslavia">President of Yugoslavia</a> and wartime <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisan</a> leader <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> posthumously awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Hero">Order of the People's Hero</a> to the two officers who scuttled "Zagreb".

Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia

The Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia (SSR Abkhazia) was a short-lived republic within the <a href="Caucasus%20region">Caucasus region</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> that covered the territory of <a href="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a>, and existed from 31 March 1921 to 19 February 1931. Formed in the aftermath of the <a href="Red%20Army%20invasion%20of%20Georgia">Red Army invasion of Georgia</a> in 1921, it was independent until 16 December 1921, when it agreed to a treaty uniting it with the <a href="Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Georgian SSR). The SSR Abkhazia was largely similar to an <a href="Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">autonomous Soviet republic</a>, though it retained "de facto" independence from Georgia, being given certain features only full <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">union republics</a> had, like its own military units. Through its status as a "treaty republic" with Georgia, Abkhazia joined the <a href="Transcaucasian%20SFSR">Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>, which united <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian</a>, <a href="Azerbaijani%20SSR">Azerbaijani</a>, and Georgian SSRs into one federal unit, when the latter was formed in 1922. The SSR Abkhazia was abolished in 1931 and replaced with the <a href="Abkhaz%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic</a> within the Georgian SSR.

Throughout its existence, the SSR Abkhazia was led by <a href="Nestor%20Lakoba">Nestor Lakoba</a>, who served officially as the Chairman of the <a href="Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars">Council of People's Commissars</a> but controlled the republic to such an extent it was jokingly referred to as "Lakobistan". Due to Lakoba's close relationship with Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, <a href="collectivization%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">collectivisation</a> was delayed until after Abkhazia was incorporated into Georgia. Abkhazia remained a major tobacco producer in this era, growing over half of the USSR's supply. It also produced other agricultural produce, including tea, wine, and citrus fruits, leading to Abkhazia being one of the wealthiest regions in the Soviet Union. Its sub-tropical climate also made it a prime holiday destination; Stalin and other Soviet leaders had "<a href="dacha">dacha</a>s" (holiday homes) in the region and spent considerable time there.

An ethnically diverse region, Abkhazia was nominally led by the <a href="Abkhazians">Abkhaz</a> people, who made up less than 30 percent of the population. Other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured and the <a href="Abkhaz%20language">Abkhaz language</a> was promoted as a result of the <a href="korenizatsiia">korenizatsiia</a> policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, leading to the rise of Abkhaz nationalism. The main legacy of the SSR Abkhazia is that for the first time in modern history, it created a defined geographic entity under the name Abkhazia. Though the quasi-independent republic was downgraded in 1931, the Abkhaz people did not forget that it had existed. With the advent of <a href="glasnost">glasnost</a> and <a href="perestroika">perestroika</a> in the late 1980s, Abkhaz leaders called for their state to be re-formed and secede from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which led to the <a href="War%20in%20Abkhazia%20%281992%E2%80%931993%29">1992–1993 war</a> between Abkhazian secessionists and Georgia, and the modern <a href="Abkhaz%E2%80%93Georgian%20conflict">Abkhaz–Georgian conflict</a>.

The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> annexed Abkhazia in the early nineteenth century and had consolidated its authority over the region by 1864. Reluctant to create ethno-territorial units, the Russian authorities incorporated the region into the <a href="Kutais%20Governorate">Kutais Governorate</a>. Large-scale population transfers saw the ethnic composition of Abkhazia radically altered, with thousands of ethnic <a href="Abkhazians">Abkhaz</a> expelled and ethnic <a href="Mingrelians">Mingrelians</a> brought in to replace them. After the 1917 <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a>, which ended the Russian Empire, the status of Abkhazia became contested and was unclear. Free from Russian rule, it considered joining the <a href="Mountainous%20Republic%20of%20the%20Northern%20Caucasus">Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus</a> in 1917, but ultimately decided against this due to the distance between Abkhazia and the rest of the groups involved. In February 1918, Abkhaz <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s attempted to create a commune—a similar system to the <a href="Soviet%20%28council%29">soviets (councils)</a> being formed in Russia. This was unsuccessful and the Bolshevik leaders, <a href="Efrem%20Eshba">Efrem Eshba</a> and <a href="Nestor%20Lakoba">Nestor Lakoba</a>, fled. The <a href="Abkhaz%20People%27s%20Council">Abkhaz People's Council</a> (APC) was formed in the aftermath and effectively controlled the region. When the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Georgia">Democratic Republic of Georgia</a> was formed in May 1918, it annexed Abkhazia, considering it an integral part of its territory. Georgia never fully established control of the region, leaving the APC to rule it until the Bolshevik invasion of 1921.

The status of Abkhazia was confirmed in the Georgian constitution of 1921. Article 107 guaranteed "Abkhazeti (district of Soukhoum)" autonomy for "the administration of their affairs". The constitution was proclaimed after the Red Army invasion of Georgia in February 1921; the nature of the promised autonomy was never determined. According to the historian <a href="Timothy%20Blauvelt">Timothy Blauvelt</a>, this had a lasting legacy in the region because it marked the first time in modern history Abkhazia was defined as a distinct geographic entity.

On 15 February 1921, the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> <a href="Red%20Army%20invasion%20of%20Georgia">invaded Georgia</a>. Abkhazia was invaded two days later. Eshba and Lakoba returned to Abkhazia before the invasion and formed a <a href="revkom">Revolutionary Committee</a> (Revkom) in preparation for a Bolshevik government. Sukhumi, the capital, was captured on 4 March. With fighting in Georgia continuing, the Revkom, who did not expect to be the sole authority over Abkhazia, took advantage of the confusion and moved to declare Abkhazia an independent republic. They sent a telegram to Moscow asking for advice on how to proceed, and suggested joining the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>, but <a href="Sergo%20Ordzhonikidze">Sergo Ordzhonikidze</a>—a leading Bolshevik and the leader of the Caucasus Bureau (<a href="Kavbiuro">Kavbiuro</a>)—dismissed the idea. As a result, on 31 March 1921, it declared that "at the will of workers a new Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia is born." This made Abkhazia a nominally independent republic with the understanding on both the Abkhaz and Georgian sides that eventually Abkhazia would join the newly-formed <a href="Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> (Georgian SSR). Until then it was regarded as being completely detached from Georgia and was treated as such. The Georgian Revkom, the governing body of the Georgian SSR, welcomed Abkhazia in a telegram on 21 May 1921, and said the form of relations should be settled during the first Workers' Congresses of both republics.

The Abkhaz Revkom, in a position of power, was reluctant to schedule a congress to determine the future status of Abkhazia because it would mean relinquishing control over the region. The Kavbiuro forced the Revkom to act and negotiations for a treaty between Abkhazia and Georgia began in October 1921. The result, signed on 16 December 1921, was a two-article treaty:

The treaty united the two states, leaving Abkhazia as a "treaty republic" nominally subservient to Georgia. The special status of Abkhazia within Georgia was reinforced in the 1922 Georgian constitution, which mentioned the "special union treaty" between the two. The 1925 Abkhazian constitution noted it was united with Georgia "on the base of a special treaty". On 13 December 1922, while united with Georgia, Abkhazia joined the <a href="Transcaucasian%20Socialist%20Federative%20Soviet%20Republic">Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic</a> (TSFSR), along with <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan%20SSR">Azerbaijan</a>. This new federation was created ostensibly for economic purposes, but was more likely done to consolidate Soviet control over the region, which had been contentious. Abkhazia was mostly treated as an autonomous region of Georgia, though unlike other autonomous states in the Soviet Union, it had its own national symbols—a flag and coat of arms—and national army units, a right only given to full republics. The coat of arms was initially described in the 1925 constitution as being "composed of a golden hammer and sickle on the background of the Abkhazian landscape with inscription in the <a href="Abkhaz%20language">Abkhaz language</a> 'SSR Abkhazia'". This was slightly modified in 1926, when the republican (and Soviet-wide) motto "Proletarians of all countries, unite!" was written in Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian (previously it had only been written in Abkhaz). It also had its own constitution, created on 1 April 1925, another right only granted to full republics.

The union with Georgia was not popular among the Abkhaz populace or leadership. It was also received poorly in Georgia, where it was regarded as a ploy by the Bolsheviks to divert Georgian hostility from the authorities in Moscow towards the Abkhaz, as the Georgians were one of the most hostile groups towards the Bolsheviks. As the only "treaty republic" in the USSR, the exact status of the SSR Abkhazia concerned the Soviet and Georgian authorities, which did not want other regions to demand a similar status. To resolve this it was decided to downgrade Abkhazia, and on 19 February 1931 it was re-formed as the <a href="Abkhaz%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic</a>, subservient to the Georgian SSR while remaining a member of the TSFSR. The move was met with public protests, the first large-scale protests in Abkhazia against the Soviet authorities.

Initially the Abkhaz Revkom, led by its chairman Efrem Eshba, controlled Abkhazia until a more permanent body could be established. On 17 February 1922 the <a href="Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars">Council of People's Commissars</a> was established, and Nestor Lakoba was elected its Chairman, becoming the "de facto" head of the republic; this was a formality for Lakoba, who had effectively been in control of Abkhazia since the Bolsheviks took control in 1921. Alongside Eshba, he had been a leading Bolshevik in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Lakoba and Eshba led two abortive attempts to seize Abkhazia in February and April 1918. After the latter attempt failed, they both fled, only returning in March 1921 after Bolshevik control had been consolidated; Eshba was soon transferred to other positions, leaving Lakoba alone as the head of Abkhazia.

Lakoba effectively controlled Abkhazia as a personal fiefdom, which was jokingly referred to as "Lakobistan", and his status as head of the republic was never contested or challenged. He resisted many of the repressive policies that were being implemented elsewhere in the Soviet Union, including <a href="Collectivization%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">collectivisation</a>. Lakoba also financially supported the Abkhaz nobility, which he was able to do because of his close personal relationship with Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>.

Abkhazia was a major producer of tobacco during the Soviet era. In the 1930s, it was responsible for up to 52 percent of the Soviet Union's tobacco exports. Other agricultural products, including tea, wine, and citrus fruits—especially tangerines—were produced in large quantities, making Abkhazia one of the most well-off regions in the entire Soviet Union, and considerably richer than Georgia. The export of these resources turned the region into "an island of prosperity in a war-ravaged Caucasus". Several factories were also built in the region as part of the overall development of the Soviet Union, though they had less impact on the overall economic strength of Abkhazia.

Abkhazia was also prized as a major holiday destination for both the Soviet elite and the general population. Stalin visited annually throughout the 1920s and was joined by his associates from the <a href="Kremlin">Kremlin</a>, who used this time to gain his trust. As host, Lakoba grew increasingly close to Stalin and became a confidant of his, allowing him to keep his dominant position over Abkhazia. This was most apparent when Lakoba refused to implement collectivisation, arguing that there were no "<a href="kulaks">kulaks</a>" (affluent peasants) in the state. Such a policy was defended by Stalin, who said the anti-kulak policy did not "take account of the specific peculiarities of Abkhaz social structure and made the mistake of mechanically transferring Russian models of social engineering to Abkhaz soil". Collectivisation was first carried out after Abkhazia was downgraded in 1931, and fully implemented in 1936 after Lakoba's death.

Throughout the SSR's existence, the <a href="Soviet%20ruble">Soviet ruble</a> was its official currency.

The SSR Abkhazia was an ethnically diverse region, whose demographics changed considerably in the decades after its annexation by Russia. Up to 100,000 Abkhaz had been deported in the late nineteenth century, mainly to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. By the time the SSR Abkhazia was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30 percent of the population. The "<a href="korenizatsiia">korenizatsiia</a>" (nativization) policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, while the number of ethnic Georgians dropped by 6%. Thus, according to the <a href="First%20All-Union%20Census%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">1926 Soviet census</a>, the only census conducted during the SSR's existence, the number of ethnic Abkhaz reached 55,918 or around 27.8% of the total population (which numbered 201,016), while the number of Georgians was around 67,494 (36%). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were <a href="Armenians">Armenians</a> (25,677, or 12.7 percent), <a href="Caucasus%20Greeks">Greeks</a> (14,045, or 7 percent), and <a href="Russians">Russians</a> (12,553, or 6.2 percent).

The script used for the Abkhaz language was modified during the era of the SSR Abkhazia. Under "korenizatsiia" the Abkhaz were not considered one of the "advanced" peoples in the USSR, and thus saw an increased focus on their national language and cultural development. As part of these policies, Abkhaz—along with many other regional languages in the USSR—was <a href="Latinisation%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Latinized</a> in 1928, moving it away from the original <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic-based script</a>. Emphasis was placed on developing Abkhaz culture, which was heavily promoted and financed. To further this, an Abkhazian Scientific Society was created in 1922, while an Academy of Abkhazian Language and Literature was founded in 1925.

In recognition of the multiple ethnic groups within Abkhazia, Article 8 of the 1925 Abkhaz constitution called for three official languages—Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian—while a later amendment stated, "all nationalities populating the SSR Abkhazia are guaranteed the right of free development and use of the native language both in national-cultural and in general state agencies". Most of the population did not understand Abkhaz so Russian was the dominant language of government while local regions used the language that was most prevalent there.

The exact status of Abkhazia as a "treaty republic" was never clarified during its existence, and historian <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Saparov">Arsène Saparov</a> has suggested even officials at the time did not know what the phrase meant. The status had symbolic meaning to the Abkhaz people, who never forgot they had, at least in theory, an independent state. With the advent of <a href="glasnost">glasnost</a> and <a href="perestroika">perestroika</a> in the 1980s, calls for Abkhazia to restore its status began. An assembly at <a href="Lykhny">Lykhny</a> in 1989 called for the Soviet authorities to make Abkhazia a full union republic, claiming the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent for this move. When Abkhazia declared independence in 1990, it requested the restoration of the 1925 constitution, which called for Abkhazia and Georgia to unite, allowing for the possibility of a future union between the two states. The restoration of the 1925 constitution was a pretext for the <a href="War%20in%20Abkhazia%20%281992%E2%80%931993%29">1992–1993 war</a> and the ensuing <a href="International%20recognition%20of%20Abkhazia%20and%20South%20Ossetia">dispute over the status of Abkhazia</a>, which has led to Abkhazia being "de facto" independent of Georgia since 1992.

Sherlock Holmes Baffled

Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a <a href="Short%20film%23Short%20shorts">very short</a> American <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> created in 1900 with cinematography by <a href="Arthur%20Marvin">Arthur Marvin</a>. It is the <a href="Adaptations%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes%23Film">earliest known film</a> to feature <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s detective character <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded <a href="Mystery%20film">detective film</a>. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.

Originally shown in <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a> machines in arcades, "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" has a running time of 30 seconds. Although produced in 1900, it was only registered in 1903, and a copyright notice stating this is seen on some prints. The identities of the actors playing the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded. Assumed to be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> for many years, the film was rediscovered in 1968 as a <a href="paper%20print">paper print</a> in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

Sherlock Holmes enters his drawing room to find it being burgled, but on confronting the villain is surprised when the latter disappears. Holmes initially attempts to ignore the event by lighting a cigar, but upon the thief's reappearance, Holmes tries to reclaim the sack of stolen goods, drawing a pistol from his <a href="bathrobe">dressing gown</a> pocket and firing it at the intruder, who vanishes. After Holmes recovers his property, the bag vanishes from his hand into that of the thief, who promptly disappears through a window. At this point the film ends abruptly with Holmes looking "baffled".

The film was produced by the <a href="American%20Mutoscope%20and%20Biograph%20Company">American Mutoscope and Biograph Company</a> and was intended to be shown on the <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a>, an early <a href="film">motion picture</a> device, patented by <a href="Herman%20Casler">Herman Casler</a> in 1894. Like <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s <a href="Kinetoscope">Kinetoscope</a> the Mutoscope did not project on a screen, and provided viewing to only one person at a time. Cheaper and simpler than the Kinetoscope, the system marketed by the American Mutoscope Company quickly dominated the coin-in-the-slot "<a href="peep%20show">peep-show</a>" business.

The Mutoscope worked on the same principle as a <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>, with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user-operated hand crank. The cards were lit by electric light bulbs inside the machine, a system devised by <a href="Arthur%20Marvin">Arthur Marvin</a>'s brother, Henry, one of the founders of the Biograph company. Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light.

To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film measuring 2-23/32 inches (68 mm) wide, with an image area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm</a> format. Biograph film was not <a href="Film%20perforations">ready-perforated</a>; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole on each side of the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).

The director and cinematographer of "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" was Arthur Weed Marvin, a staff cameraman for Biograph. Marvin completed over 418 short films between 1897 and 1911, and was known for filming <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> entertainers. He later became known as the cameraman for the early silent films of <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a>. The identities of the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded.

Biograph films before 1903 were mostly <a href="Actuality%20film">actualities</a> (documentary footage of actual persons, places and events), but "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" is an example of an early Biograph comedy narrative film, produced at the company's rooftop studio on <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. According to Christopher Redmond's "Sherlock Holmes Handbook", the film was shot on April 26, 1900. Julie McKuras states that the film was released in May of the same year. Despite being in circulation, "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" was only registered on February 24, 1903, and this is the date seen on the film's copyright title card. The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a <a href="Vitagraph">Vitagraph</a> film titled "<a href="Adventures%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes%3B%20or%2C%20Held%20for%20Ransom">Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom</a>" (1905).

The film was assumed to have been <a href="Lost%20film">lost</a> for many years until a <a href="paper%20print">paper copy</a> was identified in 1968 in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, and it is in this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm film</a> in the Library of Congress collection.

The plot of "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" is unrelated to Sir <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s <a href="Canon%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes">canonical Sherlock Holmes</a> stories; it is likely that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and <a href="special%20effects">film editing effects</a>, particularly the <a href="stop%20trick">stop trick</a> first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director <a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>.

"Sherlock Holmes Baffled" marks the first in an observable trend of early film-makers to show the character as a figure of fun; in this case the somewhat louchely dressed Holmes is left "baffled" by a burglar, in contrast with the detective prowess displayed by his literary namesake. <a href="William%20K.%20Everson">William K. Everson</a> in his book "The Detective in Film" noted that "Sherlock Holmes Baffled", in common with all other silent detective films "labored under the difficulty of not being able to conduct prolonged interrogations or oral deductions ... the stress was on mystery or physical action rather than on literary-derived sleuthings." It was only in 1916 that <a href="William%20Gillette">William Gillette</a>'s "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes%20%281916%20film%29">Sherlock Holmes</a>" attempted a serious adaptation of Conan Doyle's character. Michael Pointer has suggested that the appearance and costume of the anonymous actor in "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" is an imitation of Gillette's stage portrayal of Holmes. Gillette's play "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes%20%28play%29">Sherlock Holmes</a>" had made its <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut at the <a href="Garrick%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%29">Garrick Theater</a> on November 6, 1899.

Michael Pointer's report on the rediscovery of "Sherlock Holmes Baffled" in 1968 stated "it is an early trick film clearly made for viewing on a mutoscope or peepshow machine. Although a tiny, trivial piece, it is historic as being the earliest known use of Sherlock Holmes in moving pictures." By extension of being the first Sherlock Holmes story, the inclusion of the character also makes it the first known example of a detective film. It has been posited that Sherlock Holmes has become the most prolific screen character in the <a href="history%20of%20cinema">history of cinema</a>.

Misterioso (Thelonious Monk album)

Misterioso is a 1958 <a href="live%20album">live album</a> by American <a href="jazz">jazz</a> ensemble the <a href="Thelonious%20Monk">Thelonious Monk Quartet</a>. By the time of its recording, pianist and bandleader Thelonious Monk had overcome an extended period of career difficulties and achieved stardom with his residency at New York's <a href="Five%20Spot%20Caf%C3%A9">Five Spot Café</a>, beginning in 1957. He returned there the following year for a second stint with his quartet, featuring drummer <a href="Roy%20Haynes">Roy Haynes</a>, bassist <a href="Ahmed%20Abdul-Malik">Ahmed Abdul-Malik</a>, and tenor saxophonist <a href="Johnny%20Griffin">Johnny Griffin</a>. Along with "<a href="Thelonious%20in%20Action">Thelonious in Action</a>" (1958), "Misterioso" captured portions of the ensemble's August 7 show at the venue.

The album was one of the first successful live recordings of Monk's music and was produced by <a href="Orrin%20Keepnews">Orrin Keepnews</a> of <a href="Riverside%20Records">Riverside Records</a>. According to Keepnews, the pianist played more distinctly here than on his studio albums in response to the audience's enthusiasm during the performance. "Misterioso"s title was meant to evoke Monk's reputation as an enigmatic, challenging performer, while its cover art was part of Riverside's attempt to capitalize on his popularity with intellectual and bohemian audiences; it appropriated <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a>'s 1915 painting "The Seer".

"Misterioso" was originally met with a mixed critical reaction; reviewers applauded Monk's performance but were critical of Griffin, whose playing they felt was out of place with the quartet. The album was remastered and reissued in 1989 and 2012 by <a href="Original%20Jazz%20Classics">Original Jazz Classics</a>, and has since received retrospective acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed Griffin's playing as the record's highlight.

In 1951, <a href="Thelonious%20Monk">Thelonious Monk</a> was convicted of narcotics possession after refusing to betray his friend and pianist <a href="Bud%20Powell">Bud Powell</a> to the police; a police search of the car belonging to Powell's female companion had discovered his glassine envelope of <a href="heroin">heroin</a> laying beside Monk's feet. The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's <a href="cabaret%20card">cabaret card</a>, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the <a href="Alcohol%20laws%20of%20New%20York">State Liquor Authority</a> (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was "a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician". 

In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the <a href="Five%20Spot%20Caf%C3%A9">Five Spot Café</a> in New York City's <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">East Village</a>. "I wanted to find a place that was small", he later said. "I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out." Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted <a href="Bohemianism">bohemians</a>, <a href="Hipster%20%28contemporary%20subculture%29">hipsters</a>, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity. 

Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist <a href="John%20Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>, bassist <a href="Ahmed%20Abdul-Malik">Ahmed Abdul-Malik</a>, and drummer <a href="Shadow%20Wilson">Shadow Wilson</a> in his group. However, by the time it ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left in pursuit of a solo career and a return to <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>'s group. Monk returned to New York's club scene in 1958 with a new quartet and received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the venue again, beginning on June 12. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer <a href="Roy%20Haynes">Roy Haynes</a>, and tenor saxophonist <a href="Johnny%20Griffin">Johnny Griffin</a>, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's <a href="comping">comping</a> during their first few weeks. During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.

<a href="Orrin%20Keepnews">Orrin Keepnews</a> attempted to record the quartet live at the Five Spot Café on two different occasions in 1958 for his label, <a href="Riverside%20Records">Riverside Records</a>. His first recording of the ensemble was of two sets during their July 9 show. Monk was disappointed with the recording and did not allow Riverside to release it, although it was released later after his death. 

Keepnews returned to the venue on August 7 when Monk performed an evening show in the club's overcrowded room, which the producer had set up with recording equipment. It yielded both "Misterioso" and "<a href="Thelonious%20in%20Action">Thelonious in Action</a>"; the latter was released first in 1958. The show was believed to be the first successful live recording of Monk's music, until the recording of <a href="Thelonious%20Monk%20Quartet%20with%20John%20Coltrane%20at%20Carnegie%20Hall">his 1957 concert with Coltrane at Carnegie Hall</a> was discovered and released in 2005. The two live albums from the Five Spot Café are the only recordings that document Monk's time with Griffin.
According to jazz critic <a href="Gary%20Giddins">Gary Giddins</a>, "Misterioso" is a <a href="hard%20bop">hard bop</a> record. The songs performed for the album were <a href="arrangements">arranged</a> by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a>, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: "It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition." In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.

On "Nutty", Griffin incorporated <a href="Line%20%28music%29">lines</a> from "<a href="The%20Surrey%20with%20the%20Fringe%20on%20Top">The Surrey with the Fringe on Top</a>" and exhibited a frenetic <a href="Swing%20%28jazz%20performance%20style%29">swing</a> that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. "Blues Five Spot", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a> homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured <a href="chord%20structure">chord structure</a>s and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo <a href="vamp%20%28music%29">vamp</a> maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated "<a href="Popeye">Popeye</a>" theatrical shorts; he played "<a href="The%20Sailor%27s%20Hornpipe">The Sailor's Hornpipe</a>" at the end of "Blues Five Spot".
The quartet began "<a href="In%20Walked%20Bud">In Walked Bud</a>" with an eight-bar piano intro and <a href="thirty-two-bar%20form">thirty-two-bar form</a>. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a> at the top of his <a href="Register%20%28music%29">register</a> with intermittently slower <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> and <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a> elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. "<a href="Just%20a%20Gigolo%20%28song%29">Just a Gigolo</a>", a <a href="standard%20%28music%29">standard</a>, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version. It was played as a single <a href="refrain">chorus</a> repeated at length.

The title track—first recorded for <a href="Blue%20Note%20Records">Blue Note Records</a> in 1948 with vibraphonist <a href="Milt%20Jackson">Milt Jackson</a>—is one of Monk's most influential recordings and is based on a series of <a href="minor%20second">minor second</a> <a href="tone%20cluster">clusters</a>. His performance of the song at the Five Spot Café showcased his idiosyncratic playing of one <a href="blue%20note">blue note</a> next to another. Monk superimposed musical ideas that deviated from the song's original <a href="tonal%20center">tonal center</a>, adding a <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a> blue note to the <a href="D%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">D-flat</a> blue note. Haynes' subdued drumming backed Griffin's aggressive <a href="bebop">bop</a> playing and extended solo on "Misterioso".

According to Keepnews, the album and its title track were named as a slight play on the words "mist" and "mystery", meant to evoke the perception of Monk's music as enigmatic and challenging at the time. Jazz critic Neil Tesser said that the word, which is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "in a mysterious manner", was "used most often as a musical direction in <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> scores. But by the time Monk's quartet recorded this music [in 1958] 'Misterioso' had largely come to identify Monk himself."

To capitalize on Monk's popularity with intellectual and bohemian fans from venues such as the Five Spot Café, Riverside released "Misterioso" and reissues of his older records with designs that appropriated 20th century works of art. The album's <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> is a reproduction of <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a>'s 1915 painting "The Seer", which was originally painted as a tribute to French poet <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>. 

According to Monk biographer <a href="Robin%20Kelley">Robin Kelley</a>, Rimbaud had "called on the artist to be a seer in order to plumb the depths of the unconscious in the quest for clairvoyance". This led Kelley to believe the painting was the best choice for the album cover. "The one-eyed figure represented the visionary", he explained. "The architectural forms and the placement of the chalkboard evoked the unity of art and science—a perfect symbol for an artist whose music has been called 'mathematical.'" In the opinion of musicologist Robert G. O'Meally, the cover reflected "the mysterious violations of convention of perspective, the silences, and oddly attractive angles (the overall futuristic quality) in Monk's music".
"Misterioso" was released in 1958 by Riverside and was Monk's eighth album for the label. The following March, Monk was voted pianist of the year in an annual poll of international jazz critics from "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" magazine, who said he was heard "at his challenging, consistently creative best" on "Misterioso". Jazz critic <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a> appraised the record that May for "<a href="Sound%20%26amp%3B%20Vision%20%28magazine%29">Hi Fi Review</a>", in which he said it was not one of the pianist's best albums. He observed "too little space for Monk's soloing and somewhat too much" for Griffin, whose saxophone cry and timing were more impressive than his solos. Hentoff also believed Haynes and Abdul-Malik did not support Monk as creatively as <a href="Wilbur%20Ware">Wilbur Ware</a> and <a href="Art%20Blakey">Art Blakey</a> had on his previous Riverside albums, where he said Monk was in more compelling form. When "Misterioso" was released in 1964 in the United Kingdom, <a href="Charles%20Fox%20%28jazz%20critic%29">Charles Fox</a> gave it a positive review in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>". He found its music on-par with Monk's usual standards and highlighted by exceptional playing by him and the rhythm section, particularly Haynes, who showed "once again what a great drummer he was then—and, indeed, still is today". However, Fox felt Griffin did not fit in with the quartet and overshadowed Monk's compositions, finding the saxophonist's solos diffuse and characterized by trivial quotations rather than <a href="musical%20development">musical development</a>.
In the "<a href="All%20Music%20Guide%20to%20Jazz">All Music Guide to Jazz</a>" (2002), Lindsay Planer wrote that Monk's quartet "continually reinvented" their strong, cohesive sound with "overwhelming and instinctual capacities" throughout "Misterioso". He especially praised Griffin, saying he "consistently liberated the performances". Monk biographer Robin Kelley felt because he had mastered Monk's songs at that point, his solos on "Misterioso" and "Thelonious in Action" were excursive and spirited. Jazz critic <a href="Scott%20Yanow">Scott Yanow</a> found "Misterioso" to be the superior record because of what he said was Griffin's unforgettable solo on a passionate rendition of "In Walked Bud", while music historian <a href="Ted%20Gioia">Ted Gioia</a> listed Monk and Griffin's "freewheeling" performance on the title track as one of his recommended recordings of the composition. According to <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, both this record and "<a href="Brilliant%20Corners">Brilliant Corners</a>" (1957) represented Monk's artistic peak. He cited "Misterioso" as his favorite album and, in a 2009 article for "<a href="Barnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble">The Barnes & Noble Review</a>", wrote that Griffin's tenor solo during "In Walked Bud" remained his "favorite five minutes of recorded music". Liam McManus from "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" was less enthusiastic about Griffin's playing, which he believed was occasionally heavy-handed and detracted from the music, but still recommended "Misterioso" as an exceptional Monk record featuring the pianist in a casual performance with his quartet.

In 1989, "Misterioso" was <a href="remaster">digitally remastered</a> by <a href="mastering%20engineer">mastering engineer</a> Joe Tarantino for the album's <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a> reissue. Tarantino used 20-<a href="Audio%20bit%20depth">bit</a> K2 Super Coding System technology at <a href="Fantasy%20Studios">Fantasy Studios</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. On May 15, 2012, <a href="Concord%20Music%20Group">Concord Music Group</a> reissued the album as part of the company's <a href="Original%20Jazz%20Classics">Original Jazz Classics Remasters</a> series, along with "<a href="Jazz%20at%20Massey%20Hall">Jazz at Massey Hall</a>" (1953) and <a href="Bill%20Evans">Bill Evans</a>' 1962 record "<a href="Moon%20Beams">Moon Beams</a>". The re-release featured 24-bit remastering by Tarantino and three bonus tracks, including a medley of "Bye-Ya" and "<a href="Epistrophy">Epistrophy</a>" performed with drummer <a href="Art%20Blakey">Art Blakey</a>. Concord vice president Nick Phillips, who produced the reissue series, said "Misterioso" was "an all-time classic live Thelonious Monk record" and "an indelible snapshot of Monk live in the late '50s." McManus said that as with most reissues of jazz albums, the bonus tracks on "Misterioso" were valuable and showcased uninhibited performances of Monk's past compositions.

All songs were composed by Thelonious Monk, except where noted.

Elwood Haynes (October 14, 1857 – April 13, 1925) was an American inventor, <a href="Metallurgy">metallurgist</a>, automotive pioneer, entrepreneur and <a href="industrialist">industrialist</a>. He invented the metal alloys <a href="stellite">stellite</a> and <a href="martensitic">martensitic</a> <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> and designed one of the earliest automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a> and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably. He made many advances in the automotive industry.

Early in his career, while serving as a field superintendent at gas and oil companies during <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>'s <a href="Indiana%20Gas%20Boom">gas boom</a>, Haynes invented several devices important to the advance of the <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> industry. When working for the Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, he oversaw the construction of the first long-distance natural gas pipeline in the United States, connecting <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a> with the <a href="Trenton%20Gas%20Field">Trenton Gas Field</a> away. He began to formulate plans for a motorized vehicle in the early 1890s; he successfully road tested his first car, the "Pioneer", on <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">July 4</a>, 1894—eight years after the first automobile was patented in Germany. He formed a partnership with Elmer and Edgar Apperson in 1896 to start <a href="Haynes-Apperson">Haynes-Apperson</a> for the commercial production of automobiles. He renamed it <a href="Haynes%20Automobile%20Company">Haynes Automobile Company</a> in 1905, following the loss of his partners.

Working in his laboratory to develop new <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> with <a href="chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="steel">steel</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> resulted in the formation of strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed <a href="Haynes%20Stellite%20Company">Haynes Stellite Company</a> to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide</a> in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called <a href="Haynes%20International">Haynes International</a>. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went <a href="bankrupt">bankrupt</a> and was <a href="liquidation">liquidated</a>.

An outspoken advocate of <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a>, he made substantial donations to the <a href="Prohibition%20Party">Prohibition Party</a> and Indiana's prohibitionist leader <a href="Frank%20Hanly">Frank Hanly</a>. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201916">1916</a> as a prohibition candidate and remained active in the party until prohibition became law. Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms as president of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was an active member of the <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church. After his death from complications arising from <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, his <a href="Kokomo%2C%20Indiana">Kokomo</a> mansion was converted into the <a href="Elwood%20Haynes%20Museum">Elwood Haynes Museum</a> and is open to the public where many of his original inventions and automobiles are on display.

Haynes was born on October 14, 1857, in <a href="Portland%2C%20Indiana">Portland, Indiana</a>, the fifth of ten children of Jacob M. Haynes and Hilinda S. Haines Haynes. His family was of <a href="English%20people">English</a> descent; he was a ninth-generation descendant of Walter Haynes who immigrated from Wiltshire, England to Sudbury, Massachusetts in 1638. His father was <a href="Jay%20County%2C%20Indiana">Jay County's</a> school commissioner, a lawyer, <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> politician, and a judge of the Jay and <a href="Randolph%20County%2C%20Indiana">Randolph</a> County common pleas court. Both of Haynes' parents were dedicated <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>s and outspoken <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a>ists and educated their children from a young age to avoid liquor. His mother was the founder of a local Women's Temperance Movement Union. His paternal grandfather Henry Haynes was a <a href="gunsmith">gunsmith</a> and mechanic, and tutored Haynes about <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>. In 1866, the family moved from their two-room house in Portland into the countryside outside of town where they purchased a larger home to better accommodate their growing number of children.

At age 12, Haynes built his first vehicle from scrap railroad car parts and operated it on the county's railroad tracks. The local railroad foreman did not approve and later seized the vehicle and destroyed it. As a child, Haynes had an interest in <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and when he was 15 he built a smelting furnace and began working with <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, and <a href="iron">iron</a>. Haynes was also interested in nature and spent considerable time in the forest cataloging and observing plants, insects, and animals. Because he spent so much time there, his family nicknamed him "Wood", a nickname they used for most of his life. As he grew older, he became an avid reader of books, including "Principles of Natural Philosophy" and "Chemistry" by William Wells. His early experiments and studies interested him in the <a href="atom">fundamental properties of matter</a>, and he was intrigued by how mixing compounds could create completely different alloys.

Haynes attended public schools through <a href="eighth%20grade">eighth grade</a> and received a basic education. He had not determined a career path for himself and his parents often criticized him for lacking ambition; they insisted that he seek employment. He began by working as a <a href="janitor">custodian</a> at a local church and later for the railroad, hauling <a href="Track%20ballast">ballast</a> to construction sites. At the church, he joined the choir where he met and began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed two more years. Bertha and her family moved to <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of <a href="revival%20meeting">revival meeting</a>s were held in Indiana by <a href="Francis%20Murphy%20%28evangelist%29">Francis Murphy</a>, a leader of a national <a href="Temperance%20movement">temperance</a> organization known as the Murphy Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents' urging, and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to Bertha.

Haynes' father attended the <a href="Philadelphia%20Centennial%20Exposition">Philadelphia Centennial Exposition</a> in 1876 where he learned of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the <a href="Worcester%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Worcester</a> Technical Institute in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he found that he was ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

During his first term, he was required to receive a grade of 60 to remain in the school. Although he only achieved a 59.2 after completing his final exams, he was permitted to remain because of his "recent progress." Older than the other students in his class, he often spoke out against their use of alcohol. In his final year he took courses in metallurgy, <a href="ore">ore</a> analysis and <a href="assay">assay</a>ing, and participated in a research project developing razors. His graduation thesis was entitled "The effects of Tungsten on Iron and Steel". It laid out the basic principles of what would later become his two greatest advances in metallurgy. Haynes spent many hours in the institute's laboratory working with <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> and other metals before graduating in 1881; he was fourteenth out of twenty-one graduates—twenty did not pass.

Haynes took a job teaching at the Jay County public school after returning home. Soon his income allowed him to buy a home near Portland High School where he worked and was promoted to principal in 1882. That summer he took a week-long trip to visit Bertha in <a href="Chattanooga">Chattanooga</a>, <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, where he became sick with a cold and spent most of his time in bed nursed by Bertha, learning that her family would be returning to live in Portland in 1883. After returning from the trip, he continued saving money and in 1884 he decided to continue his education by enrolling at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. He chose the school because, as it was only eight years old, it had one of the most modern laboratories available. He took courses in chemistry and <a href="biology">biology</a> and learned advanced metallurgic techniques. His mother died in May 1885 and he decided to leave the university without completing his second year, as he was not working to attain a degree but only taking courses of interest. After he had returned home again, he took a position at the newly established Eastern Indiana Normal School and Commercial College (now <a href="Ball%20State%20University">Ball State University</a>) and served as the head of the chemistry department.

<a href="Natural%20gas">Natural gas</a> was first found in Indiana in 1876 but it was not until 1886 that the magnitude of the discovery was known; the <a href="Trenton%20Gas%20Field">Trenton Gas Field</a> was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.

In the fall of 1886, the board hired Haynes as superintendent to manage the company and oversee the creation of wells and piping. The company was one of the first in the Trenton Field, and many of the others which soon followed modeled themselves on the Portland company. As a fuel and industry, natural gas was in its earliest stages. Haynes invented several devices that became important to the success of the industry. One of his first inventions was a device capable of measuring the amount of gas being pumped from wells. Haynes' reputation as an industry leader grew out of his operations at Portland and the "Kokomo Democrat" referred to him as "the only infallible authority on natural gas in eastern Indiana" in an 1889 article.

Haynes married Bertha Lanterman in October 1887 after a ten-year relationship. The ceremony was held at her parents' Portland home and the couple honeymooned in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>. Their first child, Marie, was born on January 28, 1889, but she soon succumbed to illness and died when six months old. Their second child, a son born in 1890, also died in infancy. The deaths saddened the family and caused them to turn more to their religion. Haynes became increasingly active in the Presbyterian church and became an <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29">elder</a>. In December 1892, the Haynes' third child, Bernice, was born. A second son, March, was born 1896. The two children were well educated and grew up to assist their father in his enterprises.

A primary pipeline was laid between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw construction of the ten-mile (16 km) long pipeline and the creation of the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.

The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, headquartered in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, hired Haynes as their field superintendent in 1890 after the company's board of directors "discovered that Elwood Haynes knew more about natural gas than anyone in the state". He and his wife moved to <a href="Greentown%2C%20Indiana">Greentown</a> where he oversaw the construction of the company's first pumping wells. The company planned to construct a natural gas line from eastern Indiana to Chicago, a distance of over , which would be the first long-distance natural gas pipeline built in the United States. Haynes supervised the design and construction phases of the project. Because of the length of the line and the temperature changes between the two points, moisture in the natural gas <a href="condensation">condensed</a> on the pipe, and during colder times would freeze the pipes in some locations. The problem was a significant setback to the operation, which had to stop pumping during the winter months. Haynes solved the problem by creating a refrigeration device that would cause the moisture (which was a diluted form of <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a>) to condense, freeze, and fall into a reservoir. These devices were installed between the main lines and pumping stations and effectively removed all the moisture from the natural gas before it was pumped into the lines. This prevented water buildup in the pipes and allowed the pipes to be used year round. The concept was a significant advance in early <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> technology and was further developed by others in later years.

Haynes was offered a higher ranking position within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had become aware of the business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced <a href="monopoly">monopolist</a> <a href="Charles%20T.%20Yerkes">Charles T. Yerkes</a>. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to <a href="Kokomo%2C%20Indiana">Kokomo</a> where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 <a href="chained%20dollars">chained dollars</a>) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the <a href="Indiana%20Supreme%20Court">Indiana Supreme Court</a> ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905—modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30 km) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.

According to Haynes, he began laying out "plans for the construction of a mechanically propelled vehicle for use on highways" in 1891. His first idea was for a steam-powered vehicle, but after careful consideration he decided the use of a furnace on the device would be too dangerous. His second plan was to use electrical power, but after research he found that no practical means existed to store the electricity required for operation. He continued to develop his plans until the summer of 1893 when he attended the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">Chicago World's Fair</a>, where he first witnessed a <a href="gasoline%20engine">gasoline engine</a>. The demonstration of the newly invented engine inspired him to decide that an <a href="internal%20combustion">internal combustion</a> engine would be the most practical method to propel his vehicle. A gasoline-powered European automobile built by <a href="Germany">German</a> inventor <a href="Karl%20Benz">Karl Benz</a> (who patented the first automobile in 1886) also was on display during the fair, although it is unknown if Haynes witnessed this vehicle during his visit.

Haynes ordered a one-<a href="horsepower">horsepower</a> marine upright, two-cycle engine from <a href="Sintz">Sintz Gas Engine Company</a> in <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a> for $225. Although the engine was intended for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The engine arrived in the fall of 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.

Haynes decided he needed a different facility to continue the experiment after his wife told him she would not abide his destruction of the family kitchen. He contacted Elmer Apperson, the operator of the Riverside Machine Works, and arranged to use a space in his shop for the continued development. He agreed to work on his vehicle only after-hours, pay 40 cents per hour for the help of Elmer and his brother Edgar, and to not hold them responsible should his project fail. He started building a new carriage, this time with a heavier steel harness. He described the appearance of the vehicle as a "small truck". The wheel axles were also made of steel and the entire front axle was constructed to swivel. A central column was built of steel and laid across the axles in such a way as to allow it move in all directions within a small radius to accommodate any sudden movements by the motor or vehicle.

Because the traction of rubber tires was unknown, Haynes completed a series of tests with a bicycle on paved roads. He used a wagon built to the weight of his automobile and a horse to pull a device that would cause the wheels to turn, thereby providing traction. With this, he was able to determine the ratio of weight to gear sizes needed to enable the tires to provide sufficient traction for propulsion. Once completed, his vehicle weighed about .

He named his car the "Pioneer" and first test drove the vehicle on <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">July 4</a>, 1894. The Apperson brothers had notified the Kokomo townspeople of the test drive and a crowd gathered to witness the event. Haynes was concerned that his vehicle could injure someone in the crowd, so he had the vehicle towed by a horse and buggy to Pumpkinvine Pike, away from the crowd. The car started with Haynes driving and Elmer Apperson riding as a passenger, and traveled at 7 mph (11 km/h). He traveled for and then stopped the vehicle to manually turn it around with Elmer's help. He proceeded to drive it several more miles back into town without stopping. His trip convinced him that the vehicle was worthwhile and could become a valuable enterprise, although he was disappointed in the vehicle's handling and decided he needed to improve the steering system and find a way to divert the motor's exhaust smoke away from the carriage.

Haynes' car is believed to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. It was built two years before <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>'s <a href="Ford%20Quadricycle">Quadricycle</a>, and preceded only by <a href="Charles%20Duryea">Charles Duryea</a>'s Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American <a href="midwest">midwest</a>.

Haynes continued to drive his car as he added improvements to the vehicle, and constructed the "Pioneer II" in 1895 to incorporate his improved steering designs and an exhaust pipe. He built the new car with the intention of running it in the <a href="Chicago%20Times%20Herald%20race">1895 Chicago Times-Herald Race</a>, the first automobile race in the United States. Although over seventy-five cars were entered in the race, most of their owners did not have them completed in time for race so only three cars and six early motorcycles showed up. While driving to the race, Haynes had a confrontation with a Chicago policeman who insisted that Haynes had no right to drive his vehicle on public roads, forcing him to requisition a horse to pull the car the rest of the way. Similar incidents happened with the other race's entries so the city passed an ordinance a few days later to clear up any ambiguity in the laws and allow automobiles equal access to the city streets, allowing the postponed race to take place. While giving his car a ride around the town on the following day Haynes was involved in what is believed to be the first automobile accident after swerving to miss a street car and striking a sharp curb, busting a tire and damaging the axle. Without a spare tire, Haynes was unable to run in the race. The race was held on November 28, and thousands of spectators turned out. Duryea's car won first place and a German Benz came in second. Another contest was held in which Haynes won a prize for most intuitive design.

Haynes continued to perfect his auto design, and in late 1895 he began his work to create a new hard alloy for use as a <a href="crankcase">crankcase</a> and other auto parts. His intent was to make a metal that would be resistant to rusting. He experimented with the use of aluminum and found that when used, it significantly deadened the noise produced by the engine parts. As his designs progressed, he decided to form a partnership for the manufacture of his vehicles. At the end of 1894, Haynes joined with Elmer and Edgar Apperson to create an automobile company and began producing cars that year. Their company is recognized as being the first viable automotive company in the United States, and the second company to produce autos commercially. The <a href="Duryea%20Motor%20Wagon%20Company">Duryea Motor Wagon Company</a> had formed a year earlier, but went out of business after producing only thirteen vehicles. Haynes became involved in a dispute with the Duryea company over the advertisements Haynes-Apperson ran, claiming to have created the first automobile. The Haynes-Apperson advertisement was clearly false, but after Duryea's company went bankrupt in 1898, there was no one to continue to dispute the claim. "America's First Car" remained the company's motto for the rest of its existence.

By 1896, the company produced one new car every two to three weeks and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as <a href="Haynes-Apperson">Haynes-Apperson</a> on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At the end of that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.

Haynes-Apperson automobiles were known for their long-distance running capability. The company's cars regularly competed and won prizes in endurance races that demonstrated the distance and terrain over which the cars could travel. Haynes had soon designed superior methods of achieving traction and his car could climb hills easier than his competitors in the early races. The last model designed under the Haynes-Apperson name had three speeds and was capable of 24 mph on pneumatic tires. In 1901, a Haynes car was entered in the first Long Island Non-Stop endurance race. The Haynes car took first place in the race, adding to the company's publicity and helping to feed a large jump in sales.

Another event to gain the company significant publicity was the sale of a car to Dr. Ashley A. Webber in New York City. Webber refused to buy any car unless the seller could prove the car's endurance by driving it to his home. Haynes and Edgar Apperson readily agreed to the demand and drove the car from Kokomo to Webber's New York home, the first time an automobile traveled over . The trip took over a month; after driving several days in the rain, the two decided to install a roof on future models.

Haynes began to have disagreements with the Apperson brothers for reasons that were never made public but were probably over money and design plans. Haynes wanted to produce luxury cars because much of the company's early clientele was wealthy, while the Appersons wanted to produce utilitarian vehicles that could be marketed to businesses. The disagreement led the two brothers to split from Haynes and start a company of their own in 1902. The loss of his partners necessitated that Haynes leave his position at Indiana Gas to devote more time to his growing business. Haynes was most interested in working on development, and turned over daily management to Victor Minich in 1903. Haynes spent most of his research efforts developing metals in an attempt to discover lighter and stronger alloys for automobile parts. He also investigated other areas and published a 1906 paper on the impurities in gasoline and recommended that the sulfur content in the fuel be lowered to increase engine performance.

In 1905, three years after the <a href="Apperson">Apperson</a> brothers split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the <a href="Haynes%20Automobile%20Company">Haynes Automobile Company</a> and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000 cars was organized in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> during 1908 and Haynes, whom many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the parade down Broadway riding in the "Pioneer". He was followed by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display the advancement in technology. On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fast—in a car with a top speed of 15 mph (17 km/h)—and taken to jail. He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade. The celebration was intended to be a ten-year commemoration of the invention of the automobile, although earlier self-vehicles dated back nearly twenty years in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Haynes donated the "Pioneer" to the United States Government in 1910 to be placed in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> where it is still on display in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">National Museum of American History</a> as the second oldest motorized vehicle in the United States.

Haynes' Model L was his most popular vehicle. First designed in 1905, the three-speed car could travel at 35 mph (58 km/h) and carry four passengers; the company sold over 4,300. Haynes expanded the company significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever-increasing sales. More stock was issued and more capital raised to build a new and larger factory. By 1909 the company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced between $2,500 and $5,500. In 1910, Haynes Auto became the first company to build a car with a roof, windshield, headlights, and a speedometer as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of producing the best luxury vehicles.

More than 1,000 autos were built by Haynes Automobile Company in 1910 and the company continued to experience growth, until a devastating fire swept the company factory in 1911 and killed one employee. Recovery from the blaze was slow, and it was not until 1913 that the company was able to resume its growth. To continue the promotion of his cars, Haynes organized a trip in which he crossed the country by automobile in 1914. The trip gained considerable attention from the press and gave his company publicity and a much needed sales boost in the wake of the fire. Almost every town he visited printed newspaper stories on his invention and many hailed him as the "Father of the Automobile".

Haynes continued his research into ways to produce <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> resistant metals. While working on alloys for use in <a href="spark%20plug">spark plug</a>s, he created a metal he named <a href="stellite">stellite</a>. Realizing the value of his discovery, he patented his first version in 1907. The metal was very resistant to corrosion and had immediate application in tool making and numerous other implementations. He continued to experiment with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper to the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Congress of Applied Chemistry</a> and the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Metals">American Institute of Metals</a>, where he held memberships. His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June 20.

He applied for another patent on an alloy he called <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>, now known as martensitic stainless steel. The <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">Patent Office</a> rejected his application saying that it was not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist <a href="Harry%20Brearley">Harry Brearley</a> independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.

Seeing stellite as a far more valuable metal, he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form, but to only sell it as specific finished products. In that way, he remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal. As <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> broke out, his company received large government contracts for use of the material. Stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes, and because it was non-corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition casing. In 1916 alone, the company registered $1.3 million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year. Despite his large income, he refused to provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their wages were not raised, he told him, "It doesn't pay to give the working man too much money—it makes him too independent." His statement was widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems.

After the war, Haynes Stellite moved to producing tableware, jewelry, and pocket knives. The employees of the company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide</a> on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2 million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4 million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called <a href="Haynes%20International">Haynes International</a> and is again independent.

Haynes was an avid supporter of prohibition and spoke several times on behalf of prohibitionist leader <a href="Frank%20Hanly">Frank Hanly</a>, lending him both personal and financial support. Hanly advocated the passage of a local option law that allowed most of Indiana to ban liquor sales in 1909. He continued in his support of the <a href="Prohibition%20Party">Prohibition Party</a> and donated it thousands of dollars and an automobile nicknamed the "Prohibition Flyer". He became increasingly involved in the organization and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%20in%20Indiana">in 1916 he ran</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> on the prohibition ticket, making many speeches and stumping across the state. He was overwhelmingly defeated, receiving only 15,598 votes out of nearly one million cast. <a href="Harry%20Stewart%20New">Harry Stewart New</a>, the <a href="Republican%20party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate narrowly won the election by plurality, and Haynes was accused of costing Incumbent Democratic Senator <a href="John%20W.%20Kern">John W. Kern</a>'s re-election. Despite his personal electoral failure, liquor sales were completely banned in Indiana by a 1918 law that went into effect in 1919. With his goals achieved, Haynes switched to join the Republican Party, but was significantly less active in politics thereafter.

Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was a critic of the <a href="Indiana%20Klan">Indiana Branch</a> of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he ridiculed the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.

Haynes purchased a new home on Webster Street in Kokomo in 1915. The home, known as the Haynes Mansion, was large enough to house a personal laboratory for Haynes to work in. As he grew older and became less involved in his businesses, Haynes became increasingly philanthropic. He made regular large donations to the Presbyterian church and became a patron of the Worcester Institute he had attended, providing scholarships and donating funds for expansion.

He funded the formation of a <a href="Young%20Men%27s%20Christian%20Association">Young Men's Christian Association</a> in Kokomo where he and his son became active. Haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys to movies and bought them dinners. After several years of active membership at the local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the launching of several successful membership drives. In 1920, he was appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by <a href="Governor%20of%20Indiana">Governor</a> <a href="James%20P.%20Goodrich">James P. Goodrich</a> where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education.

The United States economy went into a recession in the early 1920s and automobile sales decreased. Coupled with increasing competition, Haynes Automobile Company began running into debt problems. Haynes had to use his personal savings to rescue the company in 1921 and pay off some outstanding accounts. A bond drive was launched to raise $1 million to help fund the company through the period, but it fell significantly short of raising enough money. Haynes was the primary purchaser of the bonds. Unlike the other large auto companies like Ford and General Motors, Haynes Auto did not have the widespread dealership agreements that were able to sustain their companies through the hard times; his company relied on customer's ordering directly from the factory. Haynes Auto sales quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6,000 cars sold in 1922. In 1923 sales dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 in 1924. The situation continued to be bleak for the company, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in October 1924. Haynes sought a merger with multiple other auto companies, including <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, but partners were not forthcoming and Haynes was forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925. He was held personally responsible for about $95,000 of the company's debt. In addition, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the company and a substantial amount in investment bonds. In total, the loss cost Haynes an estimated quarter of his net worth.

On January 6, 1925, Haynes, the Apperson brothers, and other automotive pioneers were awarded gold medals by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce at a New York City auto exhibition for their contributions to the industry. On his return trip home, he contracted <a href="influenza">influenza</a> and his health began to deteriorate rapidly. In March, he asked his son to take over his business interests while he traveled to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to seek rest in the warmer climate. His condition steadily worsened, causing him to cancel his planned trip to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and return to Kokomo. He remained in his home, attended by his personal physician and a nurse until his death from <a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a> on April 13, 1925. Haynes' funeral was held in Kokomo before his interment at the city's Memorial Park cemetery.

Haynes' fortune had shrunk considerably with the collapse of his auto company. He still held an estimated $2.85 million ($35 million in 2009 <a href="chained%20dollars">chained dollars</a>) in stocks, bonds, and other assets, but almost all of his cash savings were gone. He had already been forced to borrow money using future dividends and royalties as collateral, leaving his family with some difficulty in coming up with funds to maintain his home. Haynes' estate was left to his wife who continued to live in the family mansion until her own death from a stroke in August 1933. The family assets were distributed between Bernice and March who separately oversaw their portion of the family's interests. March inherited the family mansion, but sold it in 1957 to Martin J. Caserio, General Manager of the Delco Electronics Division of the <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors Company</a> who lived there until he was transferred to Detroit in 1964. General Motors purchased the house from Caserio at that time so that he could purchase a home in Detroit. GM maintained ownership for about a year (it was vacant) and then sold the mansion in 1965 to Bernice, who donated it to the city of Kokomo. The city converted it into the <a href="Elwood%20Haynes%20Museum">Elwood Haynes Museum</a> and it has been open to the public since 1967. In January 1944 the SS "Elwood Haynes", a <a href="Liberty%20Ship">Liberty Ship</a> built during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, was named in Haynes' honor.

Haynes is remembered as a pioneer of the American automobile, and as the creator of the first automobile design viable for mass production. He is credited as being one of those primarily responsible for the rapid growth of the natural gas industry in Indiana, a boom that made northern Indiana one of the leading industrial regions of the United States. He is also remembered for his development of stainless steel and stellite, materials that are commonly used across the world today. Stellite remains an important metal, as its ability to withstand high temperatures has made it a component in American spacecraft. In July 2015, he was inducted into the 75th class of the <a href="Automotive%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Automotive Hall of Fame</a> in Detroit, Michigan.

Haynes is the grandfather of <a href="Margaret%20Hillis">Margaret Hillis</a>, founder and director of the Chicago Symphony Chorus, and <a href="Elwood%20Hillis">Elwood Hillis</a>, an eight term Congressman representing Indiana's 5th District.

Adventure Time is an American <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> <a href="animated%20television%20series">animated television series</a> created by <a href="Pendleton%20Ward">Pendleton Ward</a> for <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a>. Produced by <a href="Frederator%20Studios">Frederator Studios</a> and Cartoon Network Studios, the series follows the adventures of a boy named <a href="Finn%20the%20Human">Finn</a> (voiced by <a href="Jeremy%20Shada">Jeremy Shada</a>) and his best friend and adoptive brother <a href="Jake%20the%20Dog">Jake</a> (<a href="John%20DiMaggio">John DiMaggio</a>)a dog with the magical power to change shape and size at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with <a href="Princess%20Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> (<a href="Hynden%20Walch">Hynden Walch</a>), the <a href="Ice%20King">Ice King</a> (<a href="Tom%20Kenny">Tom Kenny</a>), <a href="Marceline%20the%20Vampire%20Queen">Marceline the Vampire Queen</a> (<a href="Olivia%20Olson">Olivia Olson</a>), BMO (<a href="Niki%20Yang">Niki Yang</a>), and others. The series is based on a 2007 <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28pilot%29">short</a> produced for <a href="Nicktoons%20%28TV%20channel%29">Nicktoons</a> and Frederator Studios' animation <a href="%3Awikt%3Aincubation">incubator</a> series "<a href="Random%21%20Cartoons">Random! Cartoons</a>". After the short became a <a href="viral%20video">viral hit</a> on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010, and officially premiered on April 5, 2010.

The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes are decided by <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ing artists based off rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. On September 29, 2016, it was announced that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale aired on September 3, 2018.

"Adventure Time" has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over 3 million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a>s, a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>, three <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a>s, two <a href="British%20Academy%20Children%27s%20Awards">British Academy Children's Awards</a>, a <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors">Motion Picture Sound Editors Award</a>, a Pixel Award, and a <a href="Kerrang%21%20Awards">"Kerrang!" Award</a>. The series has also been nominated for three <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Television%20Award">Critics' Choice Television Award</a>s, two <a href="Annecy%20International%20Animated%20Film%20Festival">Annecy Festival Awards</a>, a <a href="TCA%20Awards">TCA Award</a>, and a <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival Award</a>, among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a> and two <a href="Harvey%20Awards">Harvey Awards</a>. Various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing, have been inspired by the series.

"Adventure Time" follows the adventures of a boy named <a href="Finn%20the%20Human">Finn the Human</a> (voiced by <a href="Jeremy%20Shada">Jeremy Shada</a>), and his best friend and adoptive brother <a href="Jake%20the%20Dog">Jake the Dog</a> (<a href="John%20DiMaggio">John DiMaggio</a>), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. <a href="Pendleton%20Ward">Pendleton Ward</a>, the series' creator, describes Finn as a "fiery little kid with strong morals". Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a>'s character in "<a href="Meatballs%20%28film%29">Meatballs</a>". This means that while Jake is somewhat care-free, he will "sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs it". Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic <a href="nuclear%20war">nuclear war</a> a thousand years before the series' events. Throughout the series, Finn and Jake interact with major characters, including: <a href="Princess%20Bubblegum">Princess Bubblegum</a> (<a href="Hynden%20Walch">Hynden Walch</a>), the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom and a sentient piece of <a href="chewing%20gum">gum</a>; the <a href="Ice%20King">Ice King</a> (<a href="Tom%20Kenny">Tom Kenny</a>), a menacing but largely misunderstood ice wizard; <a href="Marceline%20the%20Vampire%20Queen">Marceline the Vampire Queen</a> (<a href="Olivia%20Olson">Olivia Olson</a>), a thousand-year-old vampire and <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> enthusiast; Lumpy Space Princess (Pendleton Ward), a melodramatic and immature princess made out of "lumps"; BMO (<a href="Niki%20Yang">Niki Yang</a>), a sentient video game console-shaped <a href="robot">robot</a> that lives with Finn and Jake; and Flame Princess (<a href="Jessica%20DiCicco">Jessica DiCicco</a>), a flame <a href="elemental">elemental</a> and ruler of the Fire Kingdom.

According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's style was influenced by his time attending the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20the%20Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a> (CalArts) and his experiences working as a writer and <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> artist on "<a href="The%20Marvelous%20Misadventures%20of%20Flapjack">The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack</a>", a series which ran on <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> from 2008 until 2010. In an interview with "<a href="Animation%20World%20Network">Animation World Network</a>", Ward said he strives to combine "Adventure Time"s subversive humor with "beautiful" moments, using <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s film "<a href="My%20Neighbor%20Totoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a>" as inspiration for the latter. Ward has also named "<a href="Home%20Movies%20%28TV%20series%29">Home Movies</a>" and "<a href="Dr.%20Katz%2C%20Professional%20Therapist">Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist</a>" as influences, largely because both shows are "relaxing" and feature "conversational dialogue that feels natural [and is neither] over the top [nor] cartoony and shrill".

The series can trace its origin back to a seven-minute, stand-alone animated <a href="short%20film">short film</a> of <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28short%20film%29">the same name</a> (this short would later be identified as the show's pilot "post facto"). Ward created the short almost entirely by himself, and concluded its production in early 2006. It was first broadcast on <a href="Nicktoons%20Network">Nicktoons Network</a> on January 11, 2007, and was re-broadcast as part of <a href="Frederator%20Studios">Frederator Studios</a>' anthology show "<a href="Random%21%20Cartoons">Random! Cartoons</a>" on December 7, 2008. After its initial release, the video became a <a href="viral%20video">viral hit</a> on the Internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an "Adventure Time" series to Nicktoons Network, which rejected it twice. Eventually, Nicktoons' rights to commission a full series expired, and Frederatorthe short's production animation studiopitched it to other channels. One of the studios that Frederator approached was Cartoon Network, which was interested in producing a full series. However, they would only commit to a deal if Ward could prove that the pilot "wasn’t a <a href="one-hit%20wonder">one-hit wonder</a>." Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network to take a chance on the show; he recognized the series as "something that felt really indie ... comic book-y [and] new".

Cartoon Network asked Ward to submit a sample script for their consideration, but Frederator convinced him to rough out a storyboard instead, as "a board would give a better sense of what was on Pen's mind", according to Frederator's vice president Eric Homan. Ward and his college friends <a href="Patrick%20McHale%20%28cartoonist%29">Patrick McHale</a> and <a href="Adam%20Muto">Adam Muto</a> (the former of whom served as a writer, storyboard artist, and creative director for the show during its first few seasons, while the latter served as a storyboard artist and creative director for the show before eventually becoming its <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a>) began developing ideas, all the while concentrating on "keep[ing] the good things about the original short [while also] improv[ing] on" them. The group's first product was a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. Cartoon Network was not happy with this story, and so Ward, McHale, and Muto created a storyboard for the episode "<a href="The%20Enchiridion%21">The Enchiridion!</a>", which was their attempt to consciously emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short. This tactic proved successful, and Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008. "The Enchiridion!" was the first episode to enter into production.

Ward and his production team began storyboarding episodes and writing plot outlines, but Cartoon Network was still concerned about the direction of the new series. McHale later recalled that during the pitch of an episode titled "Brothers in Insomnia" (which, for various reasons, was eventually scrapped) the room was filled with executives from Cartoon Network. The pitch went well, but the production staff was soon inundated with questions about the stylistic nature of the series. Hoping to resolve these issues, Cartoon Network management hired three veteran animators who had worked on "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>": Derek Drymon (who served as executive producer for the first season of "Adventure Time"), Merriwether Williams (who served as head story editor for the show's first and second seasons), and <a href="Nick%20Jennings%20%28artist%29">Nick Jennings</a> (who became the series' long-serving art director). <a href="Thurop%20Van%20Orman">Thurop Van Orman</a>, the creator of "The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack", was also hired to guide Ward and his staff for the first two seasons. Eventually, the storyboard for "Prisoners of Love" managed to assuage many of the fears that some Cartoon Network executives had expressed.

As production for season one progressed, more artists were brought on board. <a href="Ghostshrimp">Dan "Ghostshrimp" Bandit</a>, a freelance illustrator who had also written and storyboarded on "Flapjack", was hired as the show's lead background designer; Ward told him to create background art that set the show "in a 'Ghostshrimp World". Ghostshrimp designed major locations, including Finn and Jake's home, the Candy Kingdom, and the Ice Kingdom. The position of lead character designer was eventually given to Phil Rynda, who held this role for two-and-a-half seasons. The lead production crew for the show (which included Ward and McHale) were initially hesitant to bring him on board, but they were soon convinced by director <a href="Larry%20Leichliter">Larry Leichliter</a>, who assured them that Rynda was talented and could draw in a variety of styles. With the producers satisfied, Rynda quickly began designing characters that were simple but that still fell in line with "Pen's natural aesthetic". Around this time, Rynda and McHale began drafting artistic guidelines for the show, so that its animation style would always be somewhat consistent. With many of the lead production roles filled, Ward turned his attention to choosing storyboard artists for the first season. He eventually assembled a team made up largely of "younger, inexperienced people", many of whom he discovered on the Internet. Many of these individuals had backgrounds in <a href="Alternative%20comics">indie comics</a>, and Pendleton Ward has called them "really smart, smartypants people" who were eventually responsible for inserting more idiosyncratic and spiritual ideas into the series.

For the first four-and-a-half seasons of the show, Ward served as the showrunner for "Adventure Time". In an interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Ward revealed that he had stepped down from this role sometime during the <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%205%29">fifth season</a>. As a naturally introverted person, he found interacting with and directing people every day to be exhausting. Following Ward's resignation from the post, Adam Muto became the series' new showrunner. Until late 2014, Ward continued to work on the cartoon as a storyboard artist and storyline writer. After November 2014, he stopped regularly contributing to episode outlines, although he still looked over stories, provided occasional input, and continued to storyboard for the series on a limited basis.

In terms of tone and genre, Warda self-professed fan of <a href="ambivalence">ambivalent emotions</a>, such as feeling "happy and scared at the same time"has described the show as a "dark comedy". He has also cited the fantasy <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> "<a href="Dungeons%20and%20Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a>"of which many of the show's writers are devoteesas an inspiration for the show. In the United States, the series is rated <a href="TV-PG">TV-PG</a>; Ward said that he never wanted to push the boundaries of the PG rating, writing in the "Art of Ooo" book that he "never really even thought about the rating ... we don't like stuff that's overly gross. We like cute stuff and nice things." Ward intended the show's world to have a coherent physical logic, and although magic exists in the story, the show's writers tried to create an internal consistency in the characters' interactions with the world.

In an interview with "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Ward said the show's writing process usually began with the writers telling each other what they had done the previous week to find something humorous to build on. He also said, "A lot of the time, if we're really stuck, we'll start saying everything that comes to our mind, which is usually the worst stuff, and then someone else will think that's terrible but it'll give him a better idea and the ball just starts rolling like that". Because of the busy schedule of writing and coordinating a television series, the writers did not have time to play "Dungeons and Dragons", but they still wrote stories they would "want to be playing D&D with". Sometimes, the writers and storyboard artists convened and played writing games. One game that was often used is called <a href="exquisite%20corpse">exquisite corpse</a>; one writer starts a story on a sheet of paper, and another writer tries to finish it. But while a few episodes (such as the fifth-season episode "<a href="Puhoy">Puhoy</a>" and the <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%206%29">sixth-season</a> episode "<a href="Jake%20the%20Brick">Jake the Brick</a>") have been generated using this game, Ward has confessed that "the ideas are usually terrible". Former storyboard artist and creative director <a href="Cole%20Sanchez">Cole Sanchez</a> said episode scripts are either created by expanding the good ideas produced by these writing games, or are based on an idea proposed by a storyboard artist in the hope it can be developed into an episode.

After the writers pitched stories, the ideas were compiled onto a two-or-three-page outline that contained "the important beats". The episodes were then passed to storyboard artists (often referred to colloquially as "boarders"). While many cartoons are based on script pitches to network executives, Cartoon Network allowed "Adventure Time" to "build their own teams organically" and communicate using storyboards and <a href="animatics">animatics</a>. Rob Sorcher said this novel approach was sanctioned because the company was dealing with "primarily visual people", and that by using storyboards the writers and artists could learn and grow "by actually doing the work". The storyboard artists generally worked on an episode in pairs, independent from other storyboarders, which, according to freelance writer David Perlmutter in his book "America Toons In", countered creative <a href="ennui">ennui</a> and prevented episodes from being "alike in either content or tone". The storyboard artists were given a week to "thumbnail" (roughly sketch out) a storyboard and fill in the details complete with action, dialogue, and jokes. The series' showrunner and his creative directors then reviewed the storyboard and made notes. The artists were then given another week to implement the notes and to clean up the episode. Storyboard writing and revising usually took up to a month.

Following the writing revisions, voice actors would record their parts for the episodes and an animatic would be compiled to reduce the running time to the necessary eleven minutes. Specialized artists then created prop, character, and background designs. According to former lead character designer Phil Rynda, most of this pre-production was done in <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. While the episodes' design and coloring was done in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>, the actual animation was handled in South Korea by either <a href="Rough%20Draft%20Studios">Rough Draft Korea</a> or <a href="Saerom%20Animation">Saerom Animation</a>. Animating an episode often took between three and five months alone. The animation was hand-drawn on paper, which was then digitally composited and painted with <a href="digital%20ink%20and%20paint">digital ink and paint</a>. Executive producer <a href="Fred%20Seibert">Fred Seibert</a> compared the show's animation style to that of "<a href="Felix%20the%20Cat%20%28TV%20series%29">Felix the Cat</a>" and various <a href="Max%20Fleischer">Max Fleischer</a> cartoons, but said its world was equally inspired by "the world of videogames ".

While the episodes were being handled in South Korea, the production crew in the United States worked on retakes, <a href="Underscoring">music scoring</a>, and <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a>. Upon being completed, the animation was sent back to the United States, at which point it was inspected by the production crew, who looked for mistakes in the animation or "things that didn't animate the way [the staff] intended". These problems were then fixed in Korea and the animation was finalized. From story outlining to broadcast, it took between eight and nine months for each episode to be created; because of this, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently.

While a great majority of the series' episodes were animated by Korean animation studios, "Adventure Time" occasionally featured guest animators and directors. For instance, the <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%202%29">second-season</a> episode "<a href="Guardians%20of%20Sunshine">Guardians of Sunshine</a>" was partly rendered in 3-D to emulate the style of a video game. The fifth-season episode "<a href="A%20Glitch%20is%20a%20Glitch">A Glitch is a Glitch</a>" was written and directed by Irish filmmaker and writer <a href="David%20OReilly%20%28artist%29">David OReilly</a>, and features his distinctive 3-D animation. Animator <a href="James%20Baxter%20%28animator%29">James Baxter</a> animated select scenes and characters in both the fifth-season episode "<a href="James%20Baxter%20the%20Horse">James Baxter the Horse</a>" as well as the <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%208%29">eighth-season</a> episode "Horse & Ball". The sixth-season episode "<a href="Food%20Chain%20%28Adventure%20Time%29">Food Chain</a>" was written, storyboarded, and directed by Japanese <a href="anime">anime</a> director <a href="Masaaki%20Yuasa">Masaaki Yuasa</a>, and was animated entirely by Yuasa's own studio. Another sixth-season episode, "<a href="Water%20Park%20Prank">Water Park Prank</a>", features <a href="Flash%20animation">Flash animation</a> by David Ferguson. A <a href="stop-motion">stop-motion</a> episode titled "<a href="Bad%20Jubies">Bad Jubies</a>", directed by <a href="Kirsten%20Lepore">Kirsten Lepore</a>, aired near the middle of the show's <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a>. Finally, Alex and Lindsay Small-Butera, noted for their web series "Baman Piderman", contributed animation to the eighth-season episode "Beyond the Grotto" and the ninth-season episode "<a href="Ketchup%20%28Adventure%20Time%29">Ketchup</a>".

The series' voice actors include: Jeremy Shada (Finn the Human); John DiMaggio (Jake the Dog); Tom Kenny (The Ice King); Hynden Walch (Princess Bubblegum); and Olivia Olson (Marceline the Vampire Queen). Ward provides voices for several minor characters and <a href="Lumpy%20Space%20Princess">Lumpy Space Princess</a>. Former storyboard artist Niki Yang voices the sentient video game console <a href="BMO%20%28character%29">BMO</a> in English, as well as Jake's girlfriend <a href="Lady%20Rainicorn">Lady Rainicorn</a> in Korean. Polly Lou Livingston, a friend of Pendleton Ward's mother Bettie Ward, plays the voice of the small elephant named <a href="Tree%20Trunks">Tree Trunks</a>.

The "Adventure Time" cast members recorded their lines together at group recording sessions rather than individually, with the aim of recording natural-sounding dialogue. Hynden Walch has described these group recordings as being akin to "doing a play readinga really, really out there play". The series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters, and crew members cast people with whom they were interested in working. For instance, in a panel, both Adam Muto and <a href="Kent%20Osborne">Kent Osborne</a> said the "Adventure Time" crew often sought out actors who had had roles in the television programs "" and "<a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>" to play various supporting or background characters.

The show is set in the fictional "Land of Ooo", in a post-apocalyptic future about a thousand years after a <a href="nuclear%20holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> called the "Great Mushroom War". According to Ward, the show takes place "after the bombs have fallen and magic has come back into the world". Before the series was fully developed, Ward intended the Land of Ooo to simply be "magical". After the production of the episode "Business Time", in which an iceberg containing reanimated businessmen floats to the surface of a lake, the show became explicitly post-apocalyptic; Ward said the production crew "just ran with it". Ward later described the setting as "candyland on the surface and dark underneath", noting he had never intended the Mushroom War and the post-apocalyptic elements to be "hit over the head in the show". He limited it to "cars buried underground in the background [and other elements that do not] raise any eyebrows". Ward has said the series' post-apocalyptic elements were influenced by the 1979 film "<a href="Mad%20Max">Mad Max</a>". Kenny called the way the elements are worked into the plot "very fill-in-the-blanks", and DiMaggio said, "it's been obvious the Land of Ooo has some issues".

The series has a <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> <a href="mythology%20%28fiction%29">mythology</a>or, an overarching plot and backstorythat is expanded upon in various episodes. The backstory involves mainly the Mushroom War, the origin of the series' principal antagonist the Lich, and the backstories of several of the series' principal and recurring characters. Ward has said the details behind the Mushroom War and the series' dark mythology form "a story worth telling", but that he feels the show will "save it and continue to dance around how heavy the back-history of Ooo is".

When Ward was developing the series' title sequences, the rough draft version consisted of quick shots and vignettes that were "just sort of crazy [and] nonsensical", which alluded to the show's theme of quirky adventures. These drafts included "the characters ... just punching random ghosts and monsters, jumping through anything and everything [and] there were a bunch of atomic bombs at the end of it". Ward later called this version "really silly". He sent the draft to Cartoon Network; they did not like it and wanted something more graphical like the introduction to "<a href="The%20Brady%20Bunch">The Brady Bunch</a>". Inspired by the title sequences of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Playhouse">Pee-wee's Playhouse</a>", Ward developed a new title sequence that featured a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added "silly character stuff", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a "high school [year]book" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct. After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the "simple" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film "<a href="Superbad%20%28film%29">Superbad</a>". When the theme mentions "Jake the Dog" and "Finn the Human", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background. The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.

The show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a>. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele. The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a <a href="Temp%20track">temporary version</a>. Ward said, "I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it ... I only liked the temp one!" Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. According to Ward, much of the series' music has similar "hiss and grit" because one of the show's original composers, Casey James Basichis, "lives in a pirate ship he's built inside of an apartment [and] you can hear floorboards squeak and lots of other weird sounds". As the show progressed, Basichis's friend Tim Kiefer joined the show as an additional composer. The two now work together on its music.

The show's title sequence and theme song have stayed mostly consistent throughout its run, with seven exceptions. During the <a href="Fionna%20and%20Cake">Fionna and Cake</a> episodes (<a href="viz.">viz.</a> <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%203%29">season three</a>'s "Fionna and Cake", season five's "<a href="Bad%20Little%20Boy">Bad Little Boy</a>", season six's "The Prince Who Wanted Everything", season eight's "Five Short Tables", and <a href="Adventure%20Time%20%28season%209%29">season nine</a>'s "Fionna and Cake and Fionna") the series runs a different intro sequence that mirrors the original, with the major exception that all the characters are <a href="Gender%20bender">gender-bent</a>, and the theme is sung by former storyboard revisionist <a href="Natasha%20Allegri">Natasha Allegri</a>. Likewise, the intro to the series' three miniseries are each unique: the introduction to the Marceline-centric "<a href="Stakes%20%28miniseries%29">Stakes</a>" (2015) places most of the emphasis on Marceline, and the theme song is sung by Olivia Olson; the introduction to "<a href="Islands%20%28miniseries%29">Islands</a>" (2017) adopts a nautical theme, highlights the principal characters in the miniseries, and is sung by Jeremy Shada; and the intro to "<a href="Elements%20%28miniseries%29">Elements</a>" (2017) features imagery reflecting the four primary elements in the "Adventure Time" universe (that is: fire, ice, slime, and candy) and is sung by Hynden Walch. The introductions to the guest-animated episodes "A Glitch Is a Glitch" and "Food Chain" are each unique, featuring animation courtesy of David OReilly and Masaaki Yuasa, respectively. Finally, the series finale, "Come Along With Me", features an introduction offering viewers a glimpse of future Ooo, one thousand years after Finn and Jake. This intro features the new characters Shermy and Beth, and is sung by the latter (voiced by <a href="Willow%20Smith">Willow Smith</a>).

The series regularly features songs and musical numbers. Many of the cast membersincluding Shada, Kenny, and Olsonsing their characters' songs. Characters often express their emotions in song; examples of this include Marceline's song "I'm Just Your Problem" (from season three's "<a href="What%20Was%20Missing">What Was Missing</a>") and Finn's "All Gummed Up Inside" (from season three's "<a href="Incendium">Incendium</a>"). While the series' background music is composed by Basichis and Kiefer, the songs sung by characters are often written by the storyboard artists. And while it is a general rarity, the show also occasionally refers to <a href="pop%20music">popular music</a>. Early during the show's run, Frederator, Seibert's production company, occasionally uploaded demos and full versions of songs sung by the characters to their official website, and when the production crew set up a series <a href="Tumblr">Tumblr</a> account, this tradition of publishing demos and full versions of songs to the public was revived. On November 20, 2015, the label Spacelab9 released a limited-edition 12" <a href="long%20play">LP</a> featuring many of Marceline's songs, which was followed by a <a href="The%20Music%20of%20Ooo">38-song series soundtrack</a> in October 2016.

Each "Adventure Time" episode is about eleven minutes in length; pairs of episodes are often telecast in order to fill a half-hour program time slot. Before the official debut of the first season, Cartoon Network aired both "Business Time" and "<a href="Evicted%21">Evicted!</a>" on March 11 and March 18, respectively, advertising these showings as "previews" of the series-to-come. The show officially debuted with "Slumber Party Panic" on April 5, 2010.

During the latter part of its run, the show began to experiment with the <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> format. The first of these was "Stakes" (2015), which aired during the show's seventh season. The following miniseries, "Islands" (2016) aired as part of the eight season. The third and final miniseries, "Elements" (2016), aired during the show's ninth season.

For its first six seasons, episodes would regularly air once a week. However, starting in November 2014, the show began to air new episodes via "bombs", or weeks in which new episodes debuted every day. This change in airing style disrupted the viewing patterns of some fans, as Dave Trumbore of <a href="Collider%20%28website%29">Collider</a> explained: "Back when [the show] was regularly airing in a more traditional schedule, it was a little easier to keep track of the completely insane episodes full of half-explained mythology and lots and lots of non-sequiturs. During the last few seasons, however, [when] the episodes started to arrive in more of a scattershot fashion scheduled around multi-part specials [it became easier to miss] the random airings of certain episodes."

The series concluded in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. Reruns have also aired on <a href="Boomerang%20%28TV%20channel%29">Boomerang</a> and <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>.

Upon its debut, "Adventure Time" was a ratings success for Cartoon Network. In March 2013, it was reported that the show averaged roughly 2 to 3 million viewers an episode. According to a 2012 report by <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen</a>, the show consistently ranked first in its time slot among boys aged 214. The show premiered on April 5, 2010, and was watched by 2.5 million viewers. The episode was a ratings success. According to a press release by Cartoon Network, the episode's time slot saw triple-digit percentage increases from the previous year. The program was viewed by 1.661 million children aged 211, which marked a 110 percent increase from the previous year's figures. It was watched by 837,000 children aged 914, a 239 percent increase on the previous year's figures.

Between the second and sixth seasons, the show's ratings continued to grow; the second-season premiere was watched by 2.001 million viewers, the third-season premiere by 2.686 million, the fourth-season premiere by 2.655 million, the fifth-season premiere by 3.435 million, and the sixth-season premiere by 3.321 million. The show's seventh-season opener took a substantial ratings tumble, being watched by only 1.07 million viewers. Likewise, the eighth-, ninth-, and tenth-season premieres were watched by only 1.13, 0.71, and 0.77 million viewers, respectively. The series finale, "Come Along with Me", was viewed by 0.92 million viewers and scored a 0.25 <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, which means that the episode was seen by 0.25 percent of all individuals aged 18 to 49 years old who were watching television at the time of the episode's airing.

The show has received positive reviews from critics. "The A.V. Club" reviewer Zack Handlen called it "a terrific show [that] fits beautifully in that gray area between kid and adult entertainment in a way that manages to satisfy both a desire for sophisticated (i.e., weird) writing and plain old silliness".

"Adventure Time" has been complimented for its resemblance to cartoons of the past. In an article for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", television critic Robert Lloyd compared the series to "the sort of cartoons they made when cartoons themselves were young and delighted in bringing all things to rubbery life". Robert Mclaughlin of <a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a> expressed a similar sentiment when he wrote that "Adventure Time" "is the first cartoon in a long time that is pure imagination". He complimented the show for "its non-reliance on continually referencing pop culture". Eric Kohn of "<a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>" said the show "represents the progress of [cartoon] medium" in the current decade.

A number of reviews have positively compared the series and its creators to other culturally significant works and individuals, respectively. In 2013, "Entertainment Weekly" reviewer Darren Franich called the series "a hybrid sci-fi/fantasy/horror/musical/fairy tale, with echoes of "<a href="Calvin%20and%20Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a>", Hayao Miyazaki, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>", <a href="Richard%20Linklater">Richard Linklater</a>, "<a href="Where%20the%20Wild%20Things%20Are">Where the Wild Things Are</a>", and the music video you made with your high school garage band". Emily Nussbaum of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" praised "Adventure Time"s unique approach to emotion, humor, and philosophy by likening it to ""<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>" as recapped by <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>". Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" concluded that the show was "basically what would happen if you asked a bunch of 12-year-olds to make a cartoon, only it's the best possible version of that, like if all the 12-year-olds were super geniuses and some of them were <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a> and <a href="Jack%20Kirby">Jack Kirby</a> and the <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>".

"Adventure Time"s willingness to explore dark, sad, and complex issues has received praise. Kohn applauded the fact that the show "toys with an incredibly sad subtext." Novelist <a href="Lev%20Grossman">Lev Grossman</a>, in an interview with <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition in the third-season episode "<a href="Holly%20Jolly%20Secrets">Holly Jolly Secrets</a>", the fourth-season episode "<a href="I%20Remember%20You%20%28Adventure%20Time%29">I Remember You</a>", and the fifth-season episode "<a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Marcy">Simon & Marcy</a>", noting that his origin is "psychologically plausible." Grossman praised the way the series was able to tackle the issues of <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a>, saying: "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's</a>, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying." Critics have suggested that the show has grown and matured as it has aged. In a review of season four, for instance, Mike LeChevallier of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant</a>" magazine complimented the show for "growing up" with its characters. He concluded that the series has "strikingly few faults" and awarded the fourth season three-and-a-half stars out of four.

The series has been included on a number of best-of lists. "Entertainment Weekly" ranked it number 20 (out of 25) in a list of the "Greatest Animated TV Series". Similarly, "The A.V. Club", in a non-ranked run-down of the "best animated series ever", called the series "one of the most distinctive cartoons currently on the air".

The show has also received limited criticism from reviewers. LeChevallier, in an otherwise largely positive review of the third season for "Slant" magazine, wrote that "the short-form format leaves some emotional substance to be desired", and that this was inevitable for a series with such short episodes. The independent cartoon scholar and critic David Perlmutter, who otherwise applauded the show's voice acting and its ability to surpass its source material, argued that the show's vacillation between high and low comedy epitomizes the fact that Cartoon Network is "unsure of what direction to pursue". He noted that "while some of ["Adventure Time"s] episodes work well, others [are] simply confusing." The newspaper "<a href="Metro%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Metro</a>" cited the show's frightening situations, occasional adult themes, and use of <a href="innuendo">innuendo</a> as reason why parents might not want their young children watching it.

Several former storyboard artists and production crew members who worked on "Adventure Time" have gone on to create their own series, including Pat McHale (a former storyline writer, storyboard artist, and creative director who went on to create "<a href="Over%20the%20Garden%20Wall">Over the Garden Wall</a>"), Rebecca Sugar (a former storyboard artist who went on to create "<a href="Steven%20Universe">Steven Universe</a>"), Ian Jones-Quartey (a former storyboard revisionist and supervisor who went on to create "<a href="OK%20K.O.%21%20Let%27s%20Be%20Heroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a>"), Skyler Page (a former storyboard artist who went on to create "<a href="Clarence%20%282014%20TV%20series%29">Clarence</a>"), Julia Pott (a former storyline writer who went on to create "<a href="Summer%20Camp%20Island">Summer Camp Island</a>"), and Kent Osborne (the show's former head story writer who went on to create "<a href="Cat%20Agent">Cat Agent</a>").

Heidi MacDonald of "Slate" has argued that the scouting of indie comic creators employed by "Adventure Time" (as well as several other Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon series) has led to an "animation gold rush" in which major studios are actively seeking under-the-radar talent for their shows, with her article surmising that "your favorite brilliant indie cartoonist is probably storyboarding for "Adventure Time"." MacDonald also pointed out that "Adventure Time" has influenced the tone of modern comics, noting:

If anything, walking around [comic] shows like SPX, I've noticed something of an "Adventure Time" track among many of the small press comics now coming out: Where once young cartoonists overwhelmingly produced gloomy masculine self-absorption and misanthropy in the tradition of <a href="Daniel%20Clowes">Daniel Clowes</a> or <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a>, these days many booths feature fantasy epics with colorful characters and invented worlds heavy on the talking animals. It shouldn't be surprising that up-and-coming cartoonists are absorbing the "Adventure Time" aesthetic. A 20-year-old making comics now could have been watching the show since she was 15, after all.

"Adventure Time" has attracted academic interest for its presentation of gender and <a href="gender%20roles">gender roles</a>. Emma A. Jane, a senior research fellow at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> in <a href="Sydney%2C%20Australia">Sydney, Australia</a>, said although the two main characters are male, and that many episodes involve them engaging in violent acts to save princesses, "Finn and Jake are part of an expansive ensemble cast of characters who are anything but stereotypical and who populate a program which subverts many traditional gender-related paradigms". She said the show features "roughly equal numbers of female and male characters in protagonist, antagonist, and minor roles"; includes characters with no fixed gender; uses "gendered 'design elements'" such as eyelashes and hair to illustrate character traits rather than gender; equally distributes traits regardless of gender; privileges found, adoptive families or <a href="Family%23Extended%20family">extended families</a>; frames gender in ways that suggest it is <a href="genderfluid">fluid</a>; and features elements of <a href="queer">queer</a> and <a href="transgender">transgender</a> sub-text. Carolyn Leslie, writing in "<a href="Screen%20%28journal%29">Screen</a>", agrees, saying, "despite having two male leads, "Adventure Time" is particularly strong when it comes to questioning and challenging gender stereotypes". She uses Princess Bubblegum, BMO, and Fionna and Cake as examples of characters who refuse to be readily categorized and genderized.

Since its debut, "Adventure Time" has developed a strong following among children, teenagers, and adults; according to "A.V. Club" critic Noel Murray, fans are drawn to "Adventure Time" because of "the show's silly humor, imaginative stories, and richly populated world". While the show is often described as having a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>, Eric Kohn of "IndieWire" said that the series has "started to look like one of the biggest television phenomenons of the decade". According to Alex Heigl of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine, "The show's <a href="fandom">fandom</a> is especially Internet-savvy as well, with huge communities on <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a>, <a href="Imgur">Imgur</a> and <a href="Tumblr">Tumblr</a>, who swap <a href="GIF">GIF</a>s, fan art and theories with fervent regularity." In 2016, a study by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" of the 50 TV shows with the most <a href="Facebook%20Like">Facebook Like</a>s found that "Adventure Time" "is the most popular show among the young in our datajust over two-thirds of 'likes' come from viewers [aged] 1824".

The show is popular at <a href="fan%20convention">fan convention</a>s, such as the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con">San Diego Comic-Con</a>. Reporter Emma-Lee Moss said, "This year's [2014] Comic-Con schedule reflected "Adventure Time"s growing success, with several screenings [as well as] a dramatic reading with the show's voice talent". The show is also popular with <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a>ers, or <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a>ists who wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent characters from the "Adventure Time" universe. Moss wrote, "Looking into the crowd, it was clear that [Finn's] distinctive blue shirt and white hat were being mirrored by hundreds of Cosplayers, male and female." In an interview, Olivia Olson (who voices the character Marceline) said, "Literally, anywhere you look, anywhere in your range, you're going to see at least two people dressed up like Finn. It's crazy."

On November 19, 2011, <a href="Boom%21%20Studios%23BOOM%20Kids%21%20and%20KaBOOM%21">KaBOOM! Studios</a> announced plans for an "Adventure Time" comic book series written by independent web comic creator <a href="Ryan%20North">Ryan North</a>, who wrote the series "<a href="Dinosaur%20Comics">Dinosaur Comics</a>". The series launched on February 8, 2012, with art by Shelli Paroline and Braden Lamb. In October 2014, it was revealed that North had left the comic series after three years. His duties were assumed by <a href="Christopher%20Hastings">Christopher Hastings</a>, the creator of "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Dr.%20McNinja">The Adventures of Dr. McNinja</a>". This comic book line ended in April 2018 with its seventy-fifth issue, which North returned to co-write.

After the success of the original comic book line, several spin-off mini-series were launched. In April 2012, a six-issue miniseries titled "Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens" written by Meredith Granwho created the series "<a href="Octopus%20Pie">Octopus Pie</a>"was announced. It was launched in July 2012 and features the characters Marceline and Princess Bubblegum touring the Land of Ooo as part of Marceline's rock band, The Scream Queens. Another six-issue miniseries, "Adventure Time with Fionna & Cake" was launched in January 2013. This series, drawn by "Adventure Time" series character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri, follows the gender-bent characters Fionna the Human and Cake the Cat from the episode "Fionna and Cake". Other spin-off comic series including "Candy Capers", "Flip Side", "Banana Guard Academy", and "Adventure Time: Ice King", have been released, each written and illustrated by different writers and artists. One-shot spin-offs have also been announced; the first, "Spoooktacular #1", was released in October 2015.

A separate line of comics, officially denoted as <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>s, have also been released. Books in this line include "Playing with Fire" (June 14, 2013), "Pixel Princesses" (November 6, 2013), "Seeing Red" (May 2, 2014), "Bitter Sweets" (November 11, 2014), "Graybles Schmaybles" (May 12, 2015), "Masked Mayhem" (November 11, 2015), "The Four Castles" (May 17, 2016), "President Bubblegum" (September 27, 2016), "Marshall Lee Spectaculur" (18 January 2018), "Brain Robbers" (March 28, 2017), "The Ooorient Express" (July 18, 2017), "Princess & Princess" (January 30, 2018), "Thunder Road" (June 19, 2018), and "Marceline the Pirate Queen" (February 26, 2019).

On July 21, 2018, it was announced that after the conclusion of the television series, <a href="BOOM%21%20Studios">BOOM! Studios</a> would begin serializing a comic book line entitled "Season 11". These comics would pick up after the series finale "<a href="Come%20Along%20with%20Me%20%28Adventure%20Time%29">Come Along with Me</a>" and focus on "all new stories in the aftermath of The Great Gum War." However, series show runner Adam Muto later wrote on his <a href="Ask.fm">ASKfm</a> account: "No one from the show is involved in them so ... [c]alling it Season 11 feels like a stretch." He also confirmed that the comics would not be canon to the main show.

On October 15, 2018, it was announced that a limited-run series entitled "Marcy and Simon" would be released starting in January 2019. Written by actress Olivia Olson and illustrated by Slimm Fabert, the series will "take place after the show's series finale as Marceline aims to help Simon in his quest to atone for his previous time as the Ice King."

Other "Adventure Time"-themed books have also been released. "The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia", published on July 22, 2013, was written by comedian <a href="Martin%20Olson">Martin Olson</a>, father of Olivia Olson and the voice of recurring character Hunson Abadeer. This was followed by "Adventure Time: The Enchiridion & Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook!!!", which was released on October 6, 2015. Written by Martin and Olivia Olson, it is presented as a combination of the "Enchiridion" and Marceline's secret diary. An official "Art of ..." book, titled "The Art of Ooo" was published on October 14, 2014. It contains interviews with cast and crew members, and opens with an introduction by film-maker <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>. Two volumes with collections of the show's <a href="title%20card">title card</a>s have also been released, as has a cookbook with recipes inspired by the show, and a series of prose novels published under the header "Epic Tales from "Adventure Time"" (which includes "The Untamed Scoundrel", "Queen of Rogues", "The Lonesome Outlaw", and "The Virtue of Ardor", all of which were published under the <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> "T. T. MacDangereuse").

The series has spawned several major video game releases. The first game based on the series, "", was announced by Pendleton Ward on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account in March 2012. The game was developed by <a href="WayForward%20Technologies">WayForward Technologies</a> for <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, and was released by <a href="D3%20Publisher">D3 Publisher</a> on November 20, 2012. A year later, the game "", which follows Finn and Jake as they strive "to save the Candy Kingdom by exploring the mysterious Secret Royal Dungeon deep below the Land of Ooo", was released in November 2013. On November 18, 2014, "" was released for Nintendo 3DS, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. In October 2015, the fourth major "Adventure Time" video game, titled "", was released for 3DS, Windows PC and other consoles. It is the first in the series to feature full 3D graphics. Another game, "Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion", was released for the PlayStation 4, <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, Windows, and Xbox One in July 2018. The game was published by Outright Games, developed by <a href="Climax%20Studios">Climax Studios</a>, and features the show's original cast. That game won the award for "Performance in a Comedy, Lead" with John DiMaggio at the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Video%20Game%20Trade%20Reviewers">National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers</a> Awards, in which Jeremy Shada was also nominated for the same category.

Various other minor video games have also been released. Several, including "Legends of Ooo", "Fionna Fights", "Beemo Adventure Time", and "Ski Safari: Adventure Time", have been released on the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">iOS App Store</a>. A game titled "Finn & Jake's Quest" was released on April 11, 2014, on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. Cartoon Network also released a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game titled "" on Cartoon Network's official site, on June 23, 2014. In April 2015, two downloadable content packs for "<a href="LittleBigPlanet%203">LittleBigPlanet 3</a>" on PlayStation 3 and <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> were released; one contained "Adventure Time" costumes, while the other contained a level kit with decorations, stickers, music, objects, a background, and a bonus Fionna costume.

A second VR game, entitled "Adventure Time: I See Ooo", was released on September 29, 2016. In that same month, "Adventure Time" characters were added to the "<a href="Lego%20Dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>" game. Finn and Jake became playable characters in a video game called "" which was released for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> on November 8, 2016 and the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> on October 31, 2017.

A variety of officially licensed merchandiseincluding action figures, role-playing toys, bedding, dishware, and various other productshave been released. Since the dramatic increase in popularity of the series, many graphic T-shirts have been officially licensed through popular clothing retailers. Pendleton Ward hosted T-shirt designing contests on the websites of both We Love Fine and <a href="Threadless">Threadless</a>. Other shirts can be purchased directly from Cartoon Network's store. A <a href="collectible%20card%20game">collectible card game</a> called "Card Wars", inspired by the fourth-season episode of the same name, has been released. On March 11, 2016, it was announced by <a href="Lego">Lego</a> via Lego Ideas that an official "Adventure Time" Lego set from an idea by site user, aBetterMonkey, had met voting qualifications and was approved to be produced in cooperation with Cartoon Network. The set was released in January 2017.

In February 2015, it was reported that a theatrical "Adventure Time" film was being developed by <a href="Cartoon%20Network%20Studios">Cartoon Network Studios</a>, <a href="Frederator%20Films">Frederator Films</a>, <a href="Vertigo%20Entertainment">Vertigo Entertainment</a>, and <a href="Warner%20Animation%20Group">Warner Animation Group</a>. The film is being executive-produced and written by Pendleton Ward, and produced by <a href="Roy%20Lee">Roy Lee</a> and <a href="Chris%20McKay">Chris McKay</a>. In October 2015, series producer Adam Muto confirmed that series creator Pendleton Ward is still currently "working on the premise" for the film, but that there was "nothing official to announce yet". On July 22, 2018, Muto noted that "an ["Adventure Time"] movie was never officially announced." On August 31, 2018, Muto stated that the finale of the show would not affect a potential movie, nor would the finale lead directly into a film. He also noted that "all the lore and stuff would not work for a first time viewer", indicating that a potential movie would have to be highly accessible in order to be fully developed.

"<a href="Leela%20and%20the%20Genestalk">Leela and the Genestalk</a>", an episode from the <a href="Futurama%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> of the animated <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> program "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>", features a cameo of Finn and Jake, with DiMaggio reprising his role as Jake for the appearance.

According to <a href="Al%20Jean">Al Jean</a>, the executive producer of "The Simpsons", "[The couch gag] was the brain child of Mike Anderson, our supervising director ... It's a really beautiful, elaborate crossover."

Early in the movie "<a href="Deadpool%20%28film%29">Deadpool</a>" (2016), there is a scene where Wade is riding in a taxi. When he looks down at his wrist, he is seen wearing an "Adventure Time" watch, which he has on upside down.

On the Portuguese talk show "<a href="5%20Para%20A%20Meia-Noite">5 Para A Meia-Noite</a>", the humorist Eduardo Madeira, who portrayed a hater called Osório, used Princess Bubblegum and Marceline to mock the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202018">Eurovision Song Contest 2018</a>'s Portuguese contestants, <a href="Cl%C3%A1udia%20Pascoal">Cláudia Pascoal</a> and <a href="Isaura%20%28singer%29">Isaura</a>.

On September 27, 2011, Cartoon Network released the <a href="DVD%20region%20code%23Region%20codes%20and%20countries">region 1</a> DVD "My Two Favorite People", which features a selection of twelve episodes from the series' first two seasons.

Norte Chico civilization

The Norte Chico civilization (also Caral or Caral-Supe civilization) was a complex <a href="pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian era</a> society that included as many as thirty major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. The civilization flourished between the fourth and second millennia BC, with the formation of the first city generally dated to around 3500 BC, at <a href="Huaricanga">Huaricanga</a>, in the Fortaleza area. It is from 3100 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction become clearly apparent, which lasted until a period of decline around 1800 BC. Since the early 21st century, it has been established as the oldest known civilization in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>.

This civilization flourished along three rivers, the <a href="Fortaleza%20River%20%28Peru%29">Fortaleza</a>, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters of sites. Further south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, is derived from the city of <a href="Caral">Caral</a> in the <a href="River%20Supe">Supe Valley</a>, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose a millennium after <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, was contemporaneous with the <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">Egyptian pyramids</a>, and predated the <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> by nearly two millennia.

In <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian <a href="Periodization%20of%20pre-Columbian%20Peru">Late Archaic</a>; it <a href="Aceramic">completely lacked</a> <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large <a href="Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">earthwork</a> <a href="platform%20mound">platform mound</a>s and sunken circular <a href="plaza">plaza</a>s. Archaeological evidence suggests use of <a href="textile">textile</a> technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian <a href="Andes">Andean</a> cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.

Archaeologists have been aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work occurred at <a href="Aspero">Aspero</a> on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral further inland. In the late 1990s, Peruvian archaeologists, led by <a href="Ruth%20Shady">Ruth Shady</a>, provided the first extensive documentation of the civilization with work at Caral. A 2001 paper in "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>", providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", describing fieldwork and <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.

Norte Chico has established an earlier estimate for complex societies in the Peruvian region by more than one thousand years. The <a href="Chav%C3%ADn%20culture">Chavín culture</a>, circa 900 BC, had long been considered the first civilization of the area. It is still regularly cited as such in general works.

The discovery of Norte Chico has also shifted the focus of research away from the <a href="Highland%20%28landform%29">highland</a> areas of the Andes and lowlands adjacent to the mountains (where the Chavín, and later <a href="Inca">Inca</a>, had their major centers) to the Peruvian <a href="littoral">littoral</a>, or coastal regions. Norte Chico is located in a north-central area of the coast, approximately 150 to 200 <a href="km">km</a> north of <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, roughly bounded by the <a href="Lur%C3%ADn%20Valley">Lurín Valley</a> on the south and the <a href="Casma%20Valley">Casma Valley</a> on the north. It comprises four coastal valleys: the <a href="Huaura%20Valley">Huaura</a>, <a href="Supe%20Valley">Supe</a>, <a href="Pativilca%20Valley">Pativilca</a>, and <a href="Fortaleza%20Valley">Fortaleza</a>; known sites are concentrated in the latter three, which share a common coastal plain. The three principal valleys cover only 1,800 km², and research has emphasized the density of the population centers.

The Peruvian littoral appears an "improbable, even aberrant" candidate for the "pristine" development of civilization, compared to other world centers. It is extremely arid, bounded by two <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a>s (caused by the Andes to the east, and the <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> <a href="trade%20wind">trade wind</a>s to the west). The region is punctuated by more than 50 rivers that carry Andean snowmelt. The development of widespread <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> from these water sources is seen as decisive in the emergence of Norte Chico; since all of the monumental architecture at various sites has been found close to irrigation channels.

The <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon work</a> of Jonathan Haas "et al.", found that 10 of 95 samples taken in the Pativilca and Fortaleza areas dated from before 3500 BC; the oldest, dating from 9210 BC, provides "limited indication" of human settlement during the Pre-Columbian Early Archaic era. Two dates of 3700 BC are associated with communal architecture, but are likely to be anomalous. It is from 3200 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction are clearly apparent. Mann, in a survey of the literature in 2005, suggests "sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC" as the beginning date of the Norte Chico formative period. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at <a href="Huaricanga">Huaricanga</a>, in the Fortaleza area of the north, based on Haas' dates.

Haas' early third millennium dates suggest that the development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).

Circa 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast, and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. Norte Chico's success at irrigation-based agriculture may have contributed to its being eclipsed. Anthropologist Professor Winifred Creamer of Northern Illinois University notes that "when this civilization is in decline, we begin to find extensive canals farther north. People were moving to more fertile ground and taking their knowledge of irrigation with them". It would be a thousand years before the rise of the next great Peruvian culture, the <a href="Chav%C3%ADn%20culture">Chavín</a>.

Cultural links with the highland areas have been noted by archaeologists. In particular, the links with the <a href="Kotosh%20Religious%20Tradition">Kotosh Religious Tradition</a> have been suggested.

Numerous architectural features found among the settlements of Supe, including subterranean circular courts, stepped pyramids and sequential platforms, as well as material remains and their cultural implications, excavated at Aspero and the valley sites we are digging (Caral, Chupacigarro, Lurihuasi, Miraya), are shared with other settlements of the area that participated in what is known as the Kotosh Religious Tradition. Most specific among these features are rooms with benches and hearths with subterranean ventilation ducts, wall niches, biconvex beads, musical flutes, etc.
Research into Norte Chico continues, with many unsettled questions. Debate is ongoing over two related questions: the degree to which the flourishing of the Norte Chico was based on maritime food resources, and the exact relationship this implies between the coastal and inland sites.

A broad outline of the Norte Chico diet has been suggested. At Caral, the edible <a href="domestication">domesticated plants</a> noted by Shady are <a href="Cucurbita">squash</a>, <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="Pouteria%20lucuma">lúcuma</a>, <a href="guava">guava</a>, pacay ("<a href="Inga%20feuillei">Inga feuillei</a>"), and <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a>. Haas "et al." noted the same foods in their survey further north, while adding <a href="avocado">avocado</a> and <a href="Canna%20%28plant%29">achira</a>. In 2013, good evidence for maize was also documented by Haas et al. (see below).

There was also a significant <a href="seafood">seafood</a> component at both coastal and inland sites. Shady notes that "animal remains are almost exclusively marine" at Caral, including <a href="clam">clam</a>s and <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s, and large amounts of <a href="anchovy">anchovies</a> and <a href="sardine">sardine</a>s. That the anchovy fish reached inland is clear, although Haas suggests that "<a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> [which would include clams and mussels], <a href="marine%20mammal">sea mammals</a>, and <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> do not appear to have been significant portions of the diet in the inland, non-maritime sites".

The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has aroused debate. Much early fieldwork was done in the region of Aspero on the coast, before the full scope and inter-connectedness of the several sites of the civilization were realized. In a 1973 paper, <a href="Michael%20E.%20Moseley">Michael E. Moseley</a> contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of the society and its remarkably early flourishing, a theory later elaborated as a "maritime foundation of Andean civilization" (MFAC). He also confirmed a previously observed lack of ceramics at <a href="Aspero">Aspero</a>, and deduced that "<a href="hummock">hummock</a>s" on the site constituted the remains of artificial <a href="platform%20mounds">platform mounds</a>.

This thesis of a maritime foundation was contrary to the general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly of at least one <a href="cereal">cereal</a>. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.

Concomitant to the maritime subsistence hypothesis was an implied dominance of sites immediately adjacent to the coast over other centers. This idea was shaken by the realization of the magnitude of Caral, an inland site. Supplemental to Shady's 1997 article dating Caral, a 2001 "<a href="Science%20%28magazine%29">Science</a>" news article emphasized the dominance of agriculture and also suggested that Caral was the oldest <a href="urban%20center">urban center</a> in Peru (and the entire Americas). It deprecated the idea that civilization might have begun adjacent to the coast and then moved inland. One archaeologist was quoted as suggesting that "rather than coastal antecedents to monumental inland sites, what we have now are coastal satellite villages to monumental inland sites".

These assertions were quickly challenged by Sandweiss and Moseley, who observed that Caral, though the largest and most complex Preceramic site, is not the oldest. They admitted the importance of agriculture to industry and to augment diet, while broadly affirming "the formative role of marine resources in early Andean civilization". Scholars now agree that the inland sites did have significantly greater populations, and that there were "so many more people along the four rivers than on the shore that they had to have been dominant".

The remaining question is which of the areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served as a basis for the civilization.

<a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> (of the species "<a href="Gossypium%20barbadense">Gossypium barbadense</a>") likely provided the basis of the dominance of inland over coast (whether development was earlier, later, or contemporaneous). Though not edible, it was the most important product of irrigation in the Norte Chico, vital to the production of <a href="fishing%20net">fishing net</a>s (that in turn provided maritime resources) as well as to <a href="textile">textile</a>s and textile technology. Haas notes that "control over cotton allows a ruling elite to provide the benefit of cloth for <a href="clothing">clothing</a>, bags, wraps, and adornment". He is willing to admit to a mutual dependency dilemma: "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their <a href="protein">protein</a> and the <a href="Fisherman">fishermen</a> needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish." Thus, identifying cotton as a vital resource produced in the inland does not by itself resolve the issue of whether the inland centers were a progenitor for the coast, or vice versa. Moseley argues that successful maritime centers would have moved inland to find cotton. The exact relationship between food resources and political organization remains unresolved.

Norte Chico's development is particularly remarkable for the apparent absence of a <a href="staple%20food">staple food</a>. However, recent studies increasingly dispute this and point to <a href="maize">maize</a> as a dietary backbone of this and later pre-Columbian civilizations. Moseley found a small number of maize cobs in 1973 at Aspero (also seen in site work in the 1940s and 50s) but has since called the find "problematic". However, increasing evidence has emerged about the importance of maize in this period:

The Norte Chico chiefdoms were "almost certainly <a href="theocracy">theocratic</a>, though not brutally so", according to Mann. Construction areas show possible evidence of feasting, which would have included music and likely alcohol, suggesting an elite able to both mobilize and reward the population. The degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain, but architectural construction patterns are indicative of an elite that, at least in certain places at certain times, wielded considerable power: while some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral, appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases. As further evidence of centralized control, Haas points to remains of large stone <a href="warehouse">warehouse</a>s found at Upaca, on the Pativilca, as emblematic of authorities able to control vital resources such as cotton.

Haas suggests that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> (or three, if <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> is included as a separate case). While in other cases, the idea of government would have been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was "invented". Other archaeologists have rejected such claims as hyperbolic.

In exploring the basis of possible government, Haas suggests three broad bases of power for early complex societies:
He finds the first two present in ancient Norte Chico.

Economic authority would have rested on the control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that the scope of this economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were at the center of a broad regional trade network centered on these resources.

"<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>" magazine, citing Shady, suggests a rich and varied trade life: "[Caral] exported its own products and those of Aspero to distant communities in exchange for exotic imports: "<a href="Spondylus">Spondylus</a>" shells from the coast of <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, rich <a href="dye">dye</a>s from the <a href="Andes">Andean highlands</a>, <a href="Anadenanthera%20peregrina">hallucinogenic snuff</a> from the <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon</a>." (Given the still limited extent of Norte Chico research, such claims should be treated circumspectly.) Other reports on Shady's work indicate Caral traded with communities in the jungle farther inland and, possibly, with people from the mountains.

Leaders' ideological power was based on apparent access to <a href="deities">deities</a> and the <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a>. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: an image of the <a href="Staff%20God">Staff God</a>, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a <a href="gourd">gourd</a> dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.

The act of architectural construction and maintenance may also have been a spiritual or religious experience: a process of communal exaltation and ceremony. Shady has called Caral "the sacred city" ("la ciudad sagrada"): socio-economic and political focus was on the temples, which were periodically remodeled, with major burnt offerings associated with the remodeling.

Haas notes the absence of any suggestion of physical bases of power, that is, defensive construction. There is no evidence of warfare "of any kind or at any level during the <a href="Andean%20preceramic">Preceramic Period</a>". Mutilated bodies, burned buildings, and other tell-tale signs of violence are absent, and settlement patterns are completely non-defensive. The evidence of the development of complex government in the absence of warfare is in marked contrast to archaeological theory, which suggests that human beings move away from kin-based groups to larger units resembling "<a href="Sovereign%20state">states</a>" for mutual defense of often scarce resources. A vital resource was present: <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> generally, and the cotton crop specifically, but the move to greater complexity was apparently not driven by the need for defense or warfare.

Norte Chico sites are known for their density of large sites with immense architecture. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, <a href="Northern%20China">Northern China</a>). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and <a href="Huaura%20River">Huaura River</a> valleys each have several related sites.

Evidence from the ground-breaking work of 1973 at <a href="Aspero">Aspero</a>, at the mouth of the Supe Valley, suggested a site of approximately . Surveying of the <a href="midden">midden</a> suggested extensive prehistoric construction activity. Small-scale <a href="Terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terracing</a> is noted, along with more sophisticated platform mound <a href="masonry">masonry</a>. As many as eleven artificial mounds "could be" present. Moseley calls these "Corporate Labor Platforms", given that their size, layout, and construction materials and techniques would have required an organized workforce.

The survey of the northern rivers found sites between ; between one and seven large <a href="platform%20mound">platform mound</a>s—rectangular, <a href="Terrace%20%28building%29">terraced</a> <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>s—were discovered, ranging in size from to over . Shady notes that the central zone of Caral, with monumental architecture, covers an area of just over . Six platform mounds, numerous smaller mounds, two sunken circular plazas, and a variety of residential architecture were also discovered at this site.

The monumental architecture was constructed with <a href="quarry">quarried</a> stone and river cobbles. Using <a href="Phragmites">reed</a> "shicra-bags", some of which have been preserved, laborers would have hauled the material to sites by hand. Roger Atwood of <a href="Archaeology%20%28magazine%29">"Archaeology" magazine</a> describes the process:

Armies of workers would gather a long, durable grass known as "<a href="shicra">shicra</a>" in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive <a href="retaining%20wall">retaining wall</a> of the <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a>s with the stone-filled bags.
In this way, the people of Norte Chico achieved formidable architectural success. The largest of the platforms mounds at Caral, the "<a href="Piramide%20Mayor">Piramide Mayor</a>", measures and rises high. In its summation of the 2001 Shady paper, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> suggests workers would have been "paid or compelled" to work on centralized projects of this sort, with dried <a href="anchovy">anchovies</a> possibly serving as a form of currency. Mann points to "ideology, charisma, and skilfully timed reinforcement" from leaders.

When compared to the common <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n models of the development of civilization, Norte Chico's differences are striking. A total lack of ceramics persists across the period. The BBC observes that Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art. In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: "In the Norte Chico we see almost no <a href="visual%20art">visual art</a>s. No sculpture, no carving or <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>, almost no painting or drawing—the interiors are completely bare. What we do see are these huge mounds—and textiles."

While the absence of ceramics appears anomalous, the presence of textiles is intriguing. "<a href="Quipu">Quipu</a>" (or khipu), string-based recording devices, have been found at Caral, suggesting a writing, or "proto-writing", system at Norte Chico. (The discovery was reported by Mann in "Science" in 2005, but has not been formally published or described by Shady.) The exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated. Originally it was believed to be simply a <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> used to record numeric information, such as a count of items bought and sold. Evidence has emerged that the quipu may also have recorded <a href="logographic">logographic</a> information in the same way writing does. Research has focused on the much larger sample of a few hundred quipu dating to Inca times; the Norte Chico discovery remains singular and undeciphered.

Other finds at Norte Chico have proved suggestive. While visual arts appear absent, the people may have played instrumental music: thirty-two flutes, crafted from <a href="pelican">pelican</a> bone, have been discovered.

The oldest known depiction of the <a href="Staff%20God">Staff God</a> was found in 2003 on some broken gourd fragments in a burial site in the <a href="Pativilca%20River%20Valley">Pativilca River Valley</a> and carbon dated to 2250 BCE. While still fragmentary, such archaeological evidence corresponds to the patterns of later Andean civilization and may indicate that Norte Chico served as a template. Along with the specific finds, Mann highlights "the primacy of exchange over a wide area, the penchant for collective, festive civic work projects, [and] the high valuation of textiles and textile technology" within Norte Chico as patterns that would recur later in the Peruvian cradle of civilization.

The magnitude of the Norte Chico discovery has brought academic controversy in its wake. The "monumental feud", as described by "<a href="Archaeology%20%28magazine%29">Archaeology</a>", has included "public insults, a charge of plagiarism, ethics inquiries in both Peru and the United States, and complaints by Peruvian officials to the U.S. government". The lead author of the seminal paper of April 2001 was Peruvian <a href="Ruth%20Shady">Ruth Shady</a>, with co-authors Jonathan Haas and Winifred Creamer, a married United States team; the coauthoring was reportedly suggested by Haas, in the hopes that the involvement of United States researchers would help secure funds for carbon dating as well as future research funding. Later, Shady charged the couple with <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a> and insufficient attribution, suggesting the pair had received credit for her research, which had been going on since 1994.

At issue is credit for the discovery of the civilization, naming it, and developing the theoretical models to explain it. That Shady was describing a civilization is clear in 1997 ("Los albores de la civilización en el Perú"). While locating it on the Supe River, with Caral at its center, she suggested a larger geographic base for the society: 

In 2004, Haas "et al." wrote that "Our recent work in the neighboring Pativilca and Fortaleza has revealed that Caral and Aspero were but two of a much larger number of major Late Archaic sites in the Norte Chico", while only noting Shady in footnotes. Attribution of this type is what has angered Shady and her supporters. Shady's position has been hampered by a lack of funding for archeological research in her native Peru, as well as the media advantages of North American researchers in disputes of this type.

Haas and Creamer were cleared of the plagiarism charge by their institutions. The Chicago <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a>'s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple's role as discoverers. The dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns that it could make it more difficult for United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru.

Fiji parrotfinch

The Fiji parrotfinch ("Erythrura pealii") is a species of <a href="estrildid%20finch">estrildid finch</a> <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> that was formerly considered to be a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="red-headed%20parrotfinch">red-headed parrotfinch</a>. This <a href="parrotfinch">parrotfinch</a> is a small, mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a stubby dark grey <a href="beak">bill</a>. It is found in both forested and open habitats, and has adapted well to man-made environments such as grasslands, pasture and gardens. Pairs have a <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a> in which they fly above the trees in an undulating flight, calling constantly. Breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance, and lay a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> normally of four white eggs. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, with blue balls at the upper and lower corners of the <a href="gape">gape</a>, and black markings inside the mouth; older fledglings resemble the adults, but lack the red head colouring. The Fiji parrotfinch eats seeds, especially of grasses, and also readily feeds on insects and <a href="nectar">nectar</a>. It forms small <a href="Flock%20%28birds%29">flocks</a> of up to six birds after the breeding season.

Parrotfinches may be <a href="predation">preyed upon</a> by indigenous <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> such as the endemic <a href="Fiji%20goshawk">Fiji goshawk</a>, or by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> mammals such as the <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a>, rats, and mice, and they may be susceptible to disease. The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers. It is therefore classified as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, and it is protected under Fijian law.

The parrotfinches are a genus of <a href="estrildid%20finch">estrildid finch</a>es found in Southeast Asia and Australasia. They are small birds with short rounded wings and tails. Most species have green bodies, and all but one have the red tail that gives the genus its scientific name "Erythrura", which is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ερυθρός "erythros", "red", and ουρά "oura", "tail". The English name of Fijian Fire-tail Finch was used in early writings.

The Fiji parrotfinch was initially described by American <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> and <a href="entomology">entomologist</a> <a href="Titian%20Peale">Titian Peale</a>. As chief naturalist for the <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a> of 1838–1842 led by <a href="Charles%20Wilkes">Charles Wilkes</a>, Peale collected and preserved many specimens, including the <a href="red-throated%20parrotfinch">red-throated parrotfinch</a> from <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> and the Fiji parrotfinch from <a href="Vanua%20Levu">Vanua Levu</a>. Peale named the latter species as "Geospiza prasina". Peale's birds were reviewed by German physician and <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Gustav%20Hartlaub">Gustav Hartlaub</a>. Hartlaub moved the Fiji species to the genus "Erythrura", and then had to change the <a href="species">specific name</a>, since another bird, the <a href="pin-tailed%20parrotfinch">pin-tailed parrotfinch</a> already had the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> "E. prasina". He renamed the Fiji bird as "E. pealii" in honour of its finder. The Fijian common names "kulakula" and "qiqikula" are derived from "kula", red.

The Fiji parrotfinch and the <a href="royal%20parrotfinch">royal parrotfinch</a> of northern <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> are now again usually considered to be distinct species, but they were formerly frequently treated as subspecies of the <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>n red-headed parrotfinch, "E. cyaneovirens".

The Fiji parrotfinch is a small finch, 10 cm (4 in) in length. The adult male has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish feathering of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female is very similar to the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, but the rest of the plumage is like the adult. Full mature <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.

The flight of the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats, and frequent calling. It tends to fly fairly high, landing in the tree tops, then descending to seek food. Its call is a high, thin "seep" or "peep", similar to those of other parrotfinches such as <a href="blue-faced%20parrotfinch">blue-faced</a> and red-throated, and is often repeated in bursts of varying length. The song is a long whistled double note similar to, but less urgent, than that of the <a href="orange-breasted%20myzomela">orange-breasted myzomela</a>, a Fijian endemic <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>.

Fiji has another "Erythrura" species, the rare and endangered <a href="pink-billed%20parrotfinch">pink-billed parrotfinch</a>. This is a larger bird with a green head, blue crown and black face, and a very large pink bill. The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and red-headed parrotfinches, and the rare blue-headed variant is very like the <a href="blue-faced%20parrotfinch">blue-faced parrotfinch</a>, but these three species do not occur in Fiji.

The Fiji parrotfinch is endemic to Fiji, where it is found on the four largest islands (<a href="Viti%20Levu">Viti Levu</a>, <a href="Vanua%20Levu">Vanua Levu</a>, <a href="Taveuni">Taveuni</a> and <a href="Kadavu%20Island">Kadavu</a>) and also in the smaller western islands of the <a href="Mamanuca%20Islands">Mamanuca</a> and the <a href="Yasawa%20Islands">Yasawa groups</a>. It is uncommon but widespread, found in both forested and open habitats, from sea level to at least 1,200 m (3,900 ft) on Viti Levu. It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, but American ornithologist <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> has suggested that in the central Pacific, where there are no seed-eating <a href="munia">munia</a>s occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's <a href="blue-faced%20parrotfinch">blue-faced parrotfinch</a> and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.

This species has a <a href="courtship">courtship</a> flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending while the other is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for <a href="tricolored%20parrotfinch">three-coloured</a> and <a href="red-throated%20parrotfinch">red-throated parrotfinch</a>es, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive <a href="gape">gape</a> has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a>s at the upper and lower corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.

When not breeding, the Fiji parrotfinch is gregarious, and is usually found in small flocks of up to six birds. It feeds on seeds, usually at the "milk" (watery ripe) stage. A favourite is the Guinea grass, "<a href="Megathyrsus%20maximus">Megathyrsus maximus</a>". The finch will also take seed from rice <a href="ear%20%28botany%29">ears</a>, and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant, carpet grass, "<a href="Axonopus%20compressus">Axonopus compressus</a>", which is a common lawn grass in Fiji. This finch readily takes insects, often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices. It also feeds on nectar and small berries. In some areas, this finch's diet may bring it into conflict with rice growers, but there is no evidence that this protected species is seen as a serious agricultural threat either in Fiji, or in Australia, where it is kept in captivity in small numbers.

The common endemic <a href="Fiji%20goshawk">Fiji goshawk</a> is a specialist predator of small and medium-sized birds, and the <a href="swamp%20harrier">swamp harrier</a> is also a widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, "Falco peregrinus nesiotes" will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. <a href="Barn%20owl">Barn owl</a>s eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The <a href="fan-tailed%20cuckoo">fan-tailed cuckoo</a>, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>, but the parrotfinch does not appear to be a host of this large cuckoo.

No specific parasites of Fiji parrotfinch have been recorded, but <a href="microsporidiosis">microsporidiosis</a> and <a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a>, both spread by parasites, have been found in captive populations of other parrotfinch species.

The Fijian parrotfinch is endemic to a single country; although its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population is believed to be stable, and it is therefore classed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the <a href="Codiaeum%20variegatum">croton bush</a>, but the <a href="Wildlife%20trade">pet trade</a> appears not to be a significant factor at present.

Fiji's native birdlife has been badly affected by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s. Although <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a>s have been established on <a href="Taveuni">Taveuni</a> and the forest east of <a href="Vanua%20Levu">Vanua Levu</a>, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced <a href="common%20myna">common</a> and <a href="jungle%20myna">jungle myna</a>s. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.

Edmonds station (Washington)

Edmonds is a <a href="train%20station">train station</a> serving the city of <a href="Edmonds%2C%20Washington">Edmonds, Washington</a>, in the United States. The station is served by <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>'s "<a href="Amtrak%20Cascades">Cascades</a>" and "<a href="Empire%20Builder">Empire Builder</a>" routes, as well as <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>'s <a href="Sounder%20North%20Line">Sounder North Line</a>, which runs between <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. It is located west of Downtown Edmonds adjacent to the city's <a href="ferry%20terminal">ferry terminal</a>, served by the <a href="Edmonds%E2%80%93Kingston%20ferry">Edmonds–Kingston ferry</a>, and a <a href="Community%20Transit">Community Transit</a> bus station. Edmonds station has a passenger waiting area, a single platform, and a <a href="model%20railroad">model railroad</a> exhibit.

The station building was opened by the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Great Northern Railway</a> in 1957, replacing the city's older depot from 1910. Great Northern merged into <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Railroad">Burlington Northern</a> (later <a href="BNSF%20Railway">BNSF Railway</a>) in 1970; passenger service ceased when Amtrak took over Burlington Northern's passenger routes the following year. Amtrak began operating passenger service from Edmonds station in July 1972 and it has been served by "Cascades" (originally the "<a href="Mount%20Baker%20International">Mount Baker International</a>") since 1995. Sound Transit began operating Sounder trains to Edmonds station in December 2003, and later funded a project to rebuild the station and transit center in 2011. The Sound Transit project was conceived after earlier plans to build a combined ferry–rail facility southwest of the city were cancelled in 2008.

Edmonds station is located on a single-tracked segment of the BNSF <a href="Scenic%20Subdivision">Scenic Subdivision</a> on Railroad Avenue in downtown Edmonds, adjacent to the Edmonds ferry terminal. It has a single, <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a> on the east side of the tracks, running from Dayton Street to Main Street and paved with asphalt; the southern half of the platform, measuring , has <a href="ticket%20vending%20machine">ticket vending machine</a>s, <a href="bicycle%20locker">bicycle locker</a>s, and passenger waiting shelters. The Amtrak building is located south of James Street and includes a staffed ticket office, waiting room, <a href="vending%20machine">vending machine</a>s, and restrooms. The building was designed with <a href="Modernist%20architecture">Modernist</a> elements, including clean lines in the exterior brick walls laid in a stacked bond and large floor-to-ceiling windows. The south end of the station building includes a freight room with a garage, and a hobbyist <a href="model%20railroad">model railroad</a> exhibit in the station's former baggage room.

At the north end of the station platform is a transit center used by <a href="Community%20Transit">Community Transit</a> buses. It contains "Standing Wave", a <a href="bronze">bronze</a>-and-<a href="patina">patina</a> sculpture by <a href="Gerard%20Tsutakawa">Gerard Tsutakawa</a> resembling a series of waves, installed as part of Sound Transit's art program. To the west of the transit center is the <a href="Washington%20State%20Ferries">Washington State Ferries</a> terminal, which is adjacent to Brackett's Landing Park and the city's downtown commercial district. Edmonds station has 259 parking spaces for Amtrak and Sound Transit passengers, including leased spaces from the nearby Salish Crossing shopping mall—home to the <a href="Cascadia%20Art%20Museum">Cascadia Art Museum</a> and several businesses.

Edmonds was founded in 1876 and received its first railroad in 1891, constructed by the <a href="Seattle%20and%20Montana%20Railroad">Seattle and Montana Railroad</a> between Seattle and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Great Northern Railway</a> later acquired the railroad and completed its transcontinental route to Seattle in 1893, bringing long-distance passenger service to Edmonds. The original station was located on the west side of the tracks away from downtown and derided as inaccessible and undersized for the growing city. A formal investigation of stations across <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish County</a> by the <a href="Washington%20State%20Railroad%20Commission">Washington State Railroad Commission</a> in 1909 led to a court order for Great Northern to improve their depots, including a modernized facility for Edmonds at James Street, which the railroad resisted in their failed appeal to the state court. Great Northern later agreed to build the new depot after further consultation with Edmonds city leaders over its location and amenities. Later visits by the commission attracted crowds of up to a hundred citizens, and the city agreed to a right of way franchise with Great Northern for the new depot in January 1910. The railroad and city continued to argue over the proposed depot's distance from James Street until the chamber of commerce intervened and requested a compromise be reached.

The new Edmonds depot opened in November 1910, constructed with <a href="clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a> sidings and had a wooden platform that was connected to street level by a series of ramps, which were later decorated with railroad <a href="wikt%3Aknick-knack">knick-knacks</a>. It was initially served by eight daily passenger trains: limited transcontinental trains and local service to Seattle and <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia. Freight services from the new depot also accepted shipments from the <a href="Olympic%20Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a>, delivered by boat from various <a href="Wood%20shingle">shingle</a> mills. By the late 1950s, Great Northern's declining passenger service left Edmonds with only one daily train: the "<a href="Cascadian%20%28train%29">Cascadian</a>" from Seattle to Spokane.

In March 1956, Great Northern announced plans to build a modern station in Edmonds to serve the suburban areas north of Seattle, at a cost of $185,000. The new station would include a 175-stall parking lot, a <a href="blacktop">blacktop</a> platform, and a streamlined waiting room with contemporary design elements. Construction of the new station building began in May 1956 and was substantially complete by the end of November. The former depot was demolished on December 18, 1956, and the near-complete station was put into service by the end of the month. It was dedicated on January 2, 1957, and the first transcontinental "<a href="Empire%20Builder">Empire Builder</a>" train to stop at Edmonds arrived on January 7, greeted by a crowd of 1,000 residents and civic leaders from across the region, including <a href="Washington%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Earl%20Coe">Earl Coe</a>.

In March 1970, Great Northern was merged with three other major railroads into the <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a>, which continued to operate passenger service for one year. In November, the federal government established <a href="Railpax">Railpax</a> (later Amtrak) to consolidate unprofitable transcontinental passenger services previously operated by competing railroads. The six passenger trains serving Edmonds were eliminated or rerouted elsewhere under the Railpax plan; the final "Empire Builder" train departed from Edmonds on the afternoon of April 30, 1971. The station remained open as a Burlington Northern freight stop and maintained by the railroad in hopes of restored passenger service. Passenger trains to Edmonds station returned a year later on July 17, 1972, with the restored "<a href="Pacific%20International">Pacific International</a>" between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Transcontinental service to Edmonds returned on June 13, 1973, via an extension of the "<a href="North%20Coast%20Hiawatha">North Coast Hiawatha</a>" over <a href="Stevens%20Pass">Stevens Pass</a>, and was supplemented by the rerouted "Empire Builder" in 1981. Amtrak cancelled the "North Coast Hiawatha" in 1979 and "Pacific International" in 1981 due to poor patronage and ticket sales, leaving Edmonds with only two daily train departures. Edmonds was slated to lose its ticketing office and <a href="baggage%20claim">baggage claim</a> in 1983 as part of national cuts to stations with low ridership, but was spared by Amtrak because of an increase in ticket revenue.

The <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20Corridor">Seattle–Vancouver corridor</a> was designated as a priority high-speed rail corridor by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">United States Department of Transportation</a> in 1992. Reinstatement of passenger rail service to Vancouver was supported by Congressman <a href="Al%20Swift">Al Swift</a>, who lobbied for its inclusion in the national transportation budget, along with a contribution from Washington state. The reinstated service would require raised speed limits through Edmonds, which was opposed by residents and the city council in a dispute that began in the late 1980s. The raised speed limits were approved by an <a href="administrative%20law%20judge">administrative law judge</a>, against the city's wishes, and new fences were slated to be built along the railroad using city permits. The permits remained unapproved in early May 1995, only weeks before service was scheduled to begin, and Amtrak threatened to skip Edmonds station until they were issued. An agreement was signed by Amtrak and Edmonds, allowing for trains on the "<a href="Mount%20Baker%20International">Mount Baker International</a>" to use the station beginning May 25, 1995. The train was later folded into the <a href="Amtrak%20Cascades">Amtrak "Cascades"</a> brand introduced in January 1999.

In conjunction with the Amtrak "Cascades" program, the city's government proposed the development of a <a href="multimodal%20transport">multimodal</a> center for Amtrak, <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter rail</a>, buses, and ferries to replace separate facilities in downtown Edmonds. The multimodal project, named "Edmonds Crossing", was evaluated in the 1990s and a preferred location on part of a disused <a href="Unocal%20Corporation">Unocal</a> fuel terminal at Point Edwards, to the southwest of downtown, was chosen in 1998. The multimodal hub would include a rail station with 570 parking spaces shared with ferry users, as well as a bus terminal.

The Edmonds Crossing plan included provisions for an interim commuter rail station in downtown Edmonds, to be built by the new regional transit authority (later renamed <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>). The transit authority ran a pilot commuter rail service to Seattle in early 1995, stopping at Everett and Edmonds, to promote a $6.7 billion transit plan that would be placed on a regional ballot measure in March. The ballot measure was rejected by voters, but a $3.9 billion plan was approved in the November 1996 election, including a commuter rail line from Everett to Seattle and $6 million in funding for an Edmonds station on the line. The Amtrak station was selected by Sound Transit as the site of the interim station in 2000 and the city government approved a fifteen-year plan for the interim station in 2002. The commuter rail line was originally scheduled to begin service in 2001, but was delayed due to negotiations with the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a> and <a href="BNSF%20Railway">BNSF Railway</a>, the successor to Burlington Northern. The interim station in Edmonds included an extended platform and new parking lot on the south side of the Amtrak facility, both located on property acquired from BNSF. Sounder commuter rail service from Everett and Edmonds began on December 21, 2003.

The final <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> for the Edmonds Crossing project was published in 2004 and received a <a href="Record%20of%20Decision">Record of Decision</a> the following year, but lacked a funding source. Jurisdiction of the $171 million project was transferred to Washington State Ferries in 2007, but the ferry system instead prioritized repair and replacement of vessels over capital projects, and announced in 2009 that the Edmonds Crossing project would be left unfunded for a 20-year period. Funding for the permanent Edmonds station had been approved in the <a href="Sound%20Transit%202">Sound Transit 2</a> passed by voters in 2008 and was scheduled to begin construction in the summer of 2009. In response to the cancellation of the Edmonds Crossing project, the Edmonds City Council requested the expedited design and construction of a permanent Sounder station.

Construction of the permanent Sounder station began in July 2010, following agreements signed by Sound Transit and the city government, and a formal <a href="groundbreaking">groundbreaking</a> was held in August. The $12.9 million project included the construction of a new platform, four passenger waiting shelters, a new transit center, improved lighting, and repaving of the parking lots. The new platform was opened on July 9, 2011, and was followed by the opening of the transit center in October. As part of the project, the number of parking spaces for commuter rail users was reduced from 200 to 161. An additional 53 parking spaces were opened for Sounder passengers in November 2012, leased from the private Waterfront Antique Mall while another lot with 103 spaces was built and leased to Sound Transit. Future plans call for double tracking of the railroad through Edmonds and a second platform at Edmonds station, located to the west along Railroad Avenue.

The Story of Miss Moppet

The Story of Miss Moppet is a tale about teasing, featuring a kitten and a mouse, that was written and illustrated by <a href="Beatrix%20Potter">Beatrix Potter</a>. It was published by <a href="Frederick%20Warne%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Frederick Warne & Co</a> for the 1906 Christmas season. Potter was born in London in 1866, and between 1902 and 1905 published a series of small format children's books with Warne. In 1906, she experimented with an atypical panorama design for "Miss Moppet", which booksellers disliked; the story was reprinted in 1916 in small book format.

Miss Moppet, the story's eponymous main character, is a kitten teased by a mouse. While pursuing him she bumps her head on a cupboard. She then wraps a duster about her head, and sits before the fire "looking very ill". The curious mouse creeps closer, is captured, "and because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet". She ties him up in the duster and tosses him about. However, the mouse makes his escape, and once safely out of reach, dances a jig atop the cupboard.

Although, critically, "The Story of Miss Moppet" is considered one of Potter's lesser efforts, for young children it is valued as an introduction to books in general, and to the world of <a href="Peter%20Rabbit">Peter Rabbit</a>. The character of Miss Moppet was released as a porcelain figurine in 1954 and a <a href="plush">plush</a> toy in 1973. The book has been published in a <a href="Braille">Braille</a> version, translated into seven languages, and was released in an <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">electronic format</a> in 2005. First editions in the original format are available through antiquarian booksellers.

Helen Beatrix Potter was born on July 28 1866 to <a href="barrister">barrister</a> Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter in London. She was educated by <a href="governess">governess</a>es and tutors, and passed a quiet childhood reading, painting, drawing, tending a nursery menagerie of small animals, and visiting museums and art exhibitions. Her interests in the natural world and country life were nurtured with holidays in Scotland, the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, and Camfield Place, the <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> home of her paternal grandparents.

Potter's adolescence was as quiet as her childhood. She matured into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six illustrations of her pet rabbit to a greeting card publisher. She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in <a href="mycology">mycology</a>, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as nothing more than an amateur and she abandoned fungi.
In 1900, Potter revised a tale that she had written for a child in 1893, fashioning it into a dummy book similar to the size and style of <a href="Helen%20Bannerman">Helen Bannerman</a>'s "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Little%20Black%20Sambo">The Story of Little Black Sambo</a>". Unable to find a buyer for her book, partially because the children's book market of the time depended on brightly coloured illustrations unlike Potter's line drawings, she decided to publish it privately in December 1901. <a href="Frederick%20Warne%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Frederick Warne & Co</a> had once rejected the tale but, to maintain their position in the small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the "bunny book" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist <a href="L.%20Leslie%20Brooke">L. Leslie Brooke</a>. Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations according to Warne's requirements, and she suggested Warne use the new Hentschel <a href="Four-colour%20printing%23Color%20separation%20process">three-colour printing technique</a> in the printing process for "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Peter%20Rabbit">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</a>".

Potter continued to publish children's books with Warne, and by 1905 she found herself financially independent. Her books were selling well, and her income, combined with a small inheritance, allowed her to buy <a href="Hill%20Top%2C%20Cumbria">Hill Top</a>, a farm of at <a href="Near%20Sawrey">Near Sawrey</a> in the Lake District in July of that year. When her longtime editor and fiancé <a href="Norman%20Warne">Norman Warne</a> died a few weeks after their secret engagement, she became depressed, but went on to devote herself to her stories.

In 1906, as Potter was finishing "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Mr.%20Jeremy%20Fisher">The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher</a>", she considered developing books for a younger audience. Three stories were the result: "The Story of Miss Moppet", "The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit" and "The Sly Old Cat". Inspired by <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>'s illustrations, she intended to have the stories published in "panoramic format in the style of Cruikshank's "Comic Alphabet"", as explained by Taylor. The panorama format consisted of "long strips of paper, on which the individual pages of pictures and text were arranged in order from left to right."
Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 during the development of "Miss Moppet", and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from <a href="Windermere%2C%20Cumbria%20%28town%29">Windermere</a> was a difficult subject. "[A]n exasperating model," Potter wrote, "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." Biographer <a href="Linda%20Lear">Linda Lear</a> explains that "pickle" was a word Potter used to describe "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." Potter used the same drawings of the kitten as a model for her next book, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Tom%20Kitten">The Tale of Tom Kitten</a>", which she dedicated in 1907 "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: "The Tale of Tom Kitten" and "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Samuel%20Whiskers%20or%20The%20Roly-Poly%20Pudding">The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding</a>" (1908).

Potter was an admirer of American author <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a> and created a series of plates in the 1890s for his <a href="Uncle%20Remus">Uncle Remus</a> stories, possibly in an attempt to find career direction. So deep was her admiration, Lear speculates the scene of Miss Moppet wrapping her head in the duster comes from a similar scene in an Uncle Remus tale in which <a href="Br%27er%20Fox">Br'er Fox</a> "feigns illness in a rocking chair, wrapped up with flannel". Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and, wanting not to show cruelty, she wrote of the kitten: "She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant". Children's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories.

Ten thousand copies of "The Story of Miss Moppet" were released in a panorama format priced at a <a href="%C2%A3sd">shilling</a> in November 1906, and another 10,000 copies in December 1906. There were no subsequent printings in the panorama format. The strip folded accordion-fashion into a grey cloth wallet measuring . When opened, the panorama strip measured . As Lear writes, Potter "experimented with a panorama format of fourteen pictures on one long strip of paper which folded into a wallet tied with a ribbon". Lear explains that the format "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said, "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long strips—The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again". MacDonald points out that the fragile panorama format was inappropriate for very young children.
Twenty thousand copies of "The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit" were published in panorama format in November and December 1906 in exactly the same measurements as "Miss Moppet". Both were later published in a small book format. "The Sly Old Cat" was scheduled for publication in 1907 but fell victim to the pressures exerted by booksellers. It was set aside, but was proposed for publication in 1916 as "The Story of the Sly Old Cat". Potter's eyesight was failing and she refused to develop it. The story was published in book format with Potter's 1906 rough sketches for the first time in 1971. It is not included in the standard 23-volume Peter Rabbit library.

By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had discontinued "Miss Moppet" in its panorama format, and republished the story in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette of a mouse on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that "<a href="Appley%20Dapply%27s%20Nursery%20Rhymes">Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes</a>" be published in the smaller "Miss Moppet" format.

The tale opens with an illustration of a wide-eyed kitten: "This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!" The following illustration depicts a mouse wearing a pink bowtie and green jacket "peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten." Miss Moppet darts at him, but misses and bumps her head on the cupboard. She hits the cupboard very hard and rubs her nose. The mouse scurries to the top of the cupboard and watches her.

Miss Moppet ties a duster about her head and sits before the fire on a red hassock. The mouse's curiosity is piqued; he thinks she looks very ill and comes sliding down the <a href="bell%20pull">bell-pull</a>. "Miss Moppet looks worse and worse." The mouse creeps nearer. Miss Moppet holds her head in her paws and peeks at the mouse through a hole in the duster. "The Mouse comes "very" close." Miss Moppet jumps and snags him by the tail.

"And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet." The kitten ties the mouse up in the duster then tosses it about like a ball. The mouse peeks from the hole in the duster. In the last illustration but one, Miss Moppet is seated upright on her rump and staring at the reader. The duster lies opened and empty in her paws. "She forgot about that hole in the duster", and the mouse has escaped. He dances a jig safely out of Miss Moppet's reach atop the cupboard.

<a href="James%20M.%20Redfield">James M. Redfield</a>, a <a href="classics">classics</a> professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, in his article "An Aristotelian Analysis of "Miss Moppet"" finds the story follows the tenets of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "<a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">Poetics</a>", with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes the outcome of the plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouse ..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing "us that teasing is a kind of loving when it is a kind of teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches us what it is to live in the real world."

In her essay "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix" professor of English Katherine Chandler points out that Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, making Miss Moppet nothing more than a story describing the natural behaviour of kittens. Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale. At the end of Miss Moppet, the kitten is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard. This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of <a href="modernism">modernism</a> <a href="Humphrey%20Carpenter">Humphrey Carpenter</a>, "there is nothing in [Potter's] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact if might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales". In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>.

Ruth K. MacDonald, English and children's literature professor at <a href="New%20Mexico%20State%20University">New Mexico State University</a>, agrees, writing in "Beatrix Potter" that "Miss Moppet" demonstrates Potter's ability to pare text and illustrations to essentials noting that she worked best with more complicated plots, more complicated characters, and stories with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. "Miss Moppet" is a <a href="vignette%20%28literature%29">vignette</a>, she indicates, rather than the typical Potter tale of causality, extended plot, and variety of character, and depends upon the archetypal animosity between cat and mouse with the cat being the dominant character.

"Miss Moppet" was more successful than its companion piece "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20A%20Fierce%20Bad%20Rabbit">The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit</a>" according to M. Daphne Kutzer, an English professor at the <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20Plattsburgh">State University of New York at Plattsburgh</a> and author of "Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code" (2003). Kutzer writes: "the illustrations are more fluid and the storyline more humorous and less moralistic". Potter was never at her best when writing for a clearly defined audience, Kutzer observes, and in writing a Victorian moral tale about teasing, Potter failed to completely engage the reader's imagination in either the story or the illustrations. Though, as MacDonald notes, "Miss Moppet" remains in the Potter <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>, and serves as a good initial approach to Potter's literature.

Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the "longevity of her books comes from strategy", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald. She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper. Similar "side-shows" (as she termed the ancillary merchandise) were produced throughout her life. For a number of years Potter designed Christmas cards with characters from her books that were sold to raise money for charities.

Potter died on December 22, 1943, and left her home and the original illustrations for almost all of her books, including "Miss Moppet", to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>. Hilltop was opened to visitors in 1946, and displayed her original artwork there until 1985. After Potter's death, Frederick Warne & Co granted licences to various firms for the production of merchandise based on her characters. <a href="Beswick%20Pottery">Beswick Pottery</a> of <a href="Longton%2C%20Staffordshire">Longton, Staffordshire</a> released a porcelain figurine of Miss Moppet in 1954; the firm was eventually acquired by <a href="Royal%20Doulton">Royal Doulton</a> which continued to issue the figurine under the "Royal Albert" brand until it was discontinued in 2002. From 1980 to 1995 when it went out of business, Schmid & Co. of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="Randolph%2C%20Massachusetts">Randolph, Massachusetts</a> produced a Miss Moppet music box figurine. From 1983 to 1991, Schmid distributed two Miss Moppet Christmas ornaments ( tall), made by the Italian firm ANRI. Stuffed toy manufacturers requested licensing for Potter's figures early in the 20th century; however she refused to grant permission, having been disappointed with the quality of the proposed stuffed toys. Frederick Warne & Co retained rights to all Potter merchandise and in 1973 granted a licence to the Eden Toys company of <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a> to manufacture stuffed animals based on Potter's characters. Beginning in 1975 these included a <a href="plush">plush</a> Miss Moppet, which was discontinued in 2001 when Eden Toys went out of business.
As of 2010, all 23 of Potter's small format books, including "Miss Moppet", remain in print, and are available as a complete set in a presentation box. A 400-page omnibus edition is also available, as is an <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">electronic format</a>, released in 2005. First edition and early edition Potter books are offered by antiquarian booksellers.

Although sold to <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in 1984, Frederick Warne & Co remained a subsidiary company and continues to publish Potter's books. A 2002 "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" article, written for the centennial of the publication of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit", reported that Potter was considered one of the most popular classic writers, that anniversary editions of her work were published in 1993 and 2002, and the artwork has been "re-scanned to make the illustrations look fresher and brighter". The Frederick Warne name still appears on editions of Potter's books in English.

Languages that "Miss Moppet" has been translated into include Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Vietnamese, and a <a href="Braille">Braille</a> edition in English has been prepared. "Miss Moppet" was parodied by <a href="Nicholas%20Garland">Nicholas Garland</a> in a policial cartoon in the 11 June 1976 issue of the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>". <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> had lost a <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">motion of no confidence</a> in the government of Prime Minister <a href="James%20Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>, and Garland's cartoon copied the text and parodied four panels of the story, with Callaghan as the mouse who escapes Thatcher the kitten. In 1986, MacDonald observed that Potter's books had become a "traditional part of childhood in most only English-speaking countries and in many of the countries into whose languages Potter's books have been translated".

Invisible rail

The invisible rail, Wallace's rail, or drummer rail ("Habroptila wallacii") is a large <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless</a> <a href="Rallidae">rail</a> that is <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a> in <a href="North%20Maluku">North Maluku</a>, Indonesia, where it inhabits impenetrable <a href="Metroxylon%20sagu">sago</a> swamps adjacent to forests. Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is predominantly dark slate-grey, and the bare skin around its eyes, the long, thick bill, and the legs are all bright red. Its call is a low drumming sound which is accompanied by wing-beating. The difficulty of seeing this shy bird in its dense habitat means that information on its behaviour is limited.

Recorded dietary items include sago shoots and insects, and it also swallows small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl in the top of a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black <a href="down%20feather">down</a> typical of <a href="precocial">precocial</a> newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.

The <a href="Rallidae">rails</a> are a large and very widespread family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct <a href="taxon">taxa</a> restricted to islands, 32 have lost the ability to fly.

The invisible rail, first classified by English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> in 1860, is the only member of the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus "Habroptila". The <a href="genus">genus</a> name "Habroptila" derives from the Greek "habros", "delicate, pretty, splendid" and "ptilon", "feather, wing"; " wallacii " commemorates British zoologist <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>. Local names include "soisa", "tibiales" and "rèie".

This rail is related to the <a href="New%20Guinea%20flightless%20rail">New Guinea flightless rail</a>, "Megacrex inepta", and the <a href="chestnut%20rail">chestnut rail</a>, "Eulabeornis castaneoventris", all three Australasian genera probably being derived from "<a href="Amaurornis">Amaurornis</a>" ancestors. <a href="Storrs%20Olson">Storrs Olson</a> argued that the genus "Megacrex" was so similar to "Habroptila" that "Megacrex" should be considered a junior synonym of "Habroptila", resulting in two species in the genus. This was further lumped in <a href="Sidney%20Dillon%20Ripley">Sidney Dillon Ripley</a>'s 1977 monograph of the Rallidae; he included "Habroptila" within the large genus "Rallus". This suggestion was, however, not accepted by <a href="Gerlof%20Fokko%20Mees">Gerlof Fokko Mees</a>, who pointed out distinct differences in the shape and structure of the bill. A <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> analysis based on mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity found that "Habroptila" is part of <a href="evolutionary%20radiation">evolutionary radiation</a> within the broad genus "Gallirallus" that took place around 400,000 years ago in the region.

The invisible rail is a large, long, flightless bird. The adult has a mainly dark slate-grey body, dark brown plumage on the lower back, rump and wings, and a black uppertail. Its underparts are slightly paler slate-grey than the back, and the bare skin around the eye, the long, thick <a href="Beak">bill</a> and the strong legs are bright red. It has a small spine at the bend of the wings. The sexes are identical in appearance; the plumage of <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d immature birds has not been described.

The invisible rail is superficially similar to the <a href="purple%20swamphen">purple swamphen</a>, "Porphyrio porphyrio", which has recently been found in <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a>, but that species is larger, with a short, thick red bill and a red forehead shield; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail. The invisible rail is different from the <a href="Calayan%20rail">Calayan rail</a>, "Gallirallus calayanensis", in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species; there is no overlap between the ranges of the two species.

The call is a low drumming, accompanied by a "tuk, tuk, tuk" made with the wings. The nature of the vocalisation led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet. Gerd Heinrich noted the local name "soisa", meaning drum, and described the call as being a subdued drumming "purre – purre – purre – purre – purre" which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream. The bird also produced a dull hum similar to the voice of the <a href="banded%20pig">banded pig</a> ("Sus scrofa vittatus") and reminiscent of the call of the <a href="snoring%20rail">snoring rail</a> ("Aramidopsis plateni"). Calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening, and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird. A quieter version of the call is given at the nest.
Other sounds attributed to this rail, such as loud screams, may be incorrect, since they are like those produced by the <a href="pale-vented%20bush-hen">pale-vented bush-hen</a> ("Amaurornis moluccana").

The invisible rail inhabits the dense, spiky <a href="Metroxylon%20sagu">sago</a> swamps of Halmahera, particularly where forest adjoins the boggy areas. Claims that the rail occurs in <a href="Imperata%20cylindrica">alang-alang</a> grass are thought to have arisen from confusion with the pale-vented bush-hen. German <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Gerd%20Heinrich">Gerd Heinrich</a>, who prepared for his Halmahera trip by rolling in <a href="Urtica%20dioica">stinging nettles</a>, wrote of the sago swamp habitat in the 1930s:

I am solidly confident no European has ever seen this rail alive, for that requires such a degree of toughening and such demands on oneself as I cannot so easily attribute to others. "Habroptila" is shielded by the awful thorns of the sago swamps... In this thorn wilderness, I walked barefoot and half-naked for weeks.
Sightings of the rail from 1950 to 2003 were from a restricted area of <a href="West%20Halmahera%20Regency">West Halmahera Regency</a>, at the base of the western peninsula of the island, but it was recorded prior to 1950 as far as the southern point of Halmahera. More recent records showed that it is still present in a significantly larger area, including the northeast of the island, and locals claim that it also occurs in the swamps near <a href="Kao%2C%20Indonesia">Kao</a>, in the northwest.

The difficult habitat and retiring nature of the invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although it is unclear whether it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small <a href="gastrolith">stones</a>, as do all rails, to help break up its food in the <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a>.

The invisible rail is thought to be <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour prior to nesting. A report of 4–5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect, since such a plumage is not normal for rails. In this family, chicks are typically <a href="precocial">precocial</a>, downy and black, with any ornamentation confined to the head, bare flesh, or specially modified plume feathers.

The issue was resolved in November 2010 when a nest was found in the top of a rotting tree stump, above ground level and in from the edge of a dry swamp forest in <a href="Aketajawe-Lolobata%20National%20Park">Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park</a>. The nest depression was in depth, with a lower layer of small wood chips at its base and a lining of dead leaves. The egg shells were brownish-white with dark brown and black markings of different sizes. The two very young chicks were entirely covered in black down, contrasting with a white pollux (the equivalent of the thumbnail on a human hand) and pink <a href="index%20finger">index</a> nail. The bill was black with a white tip, and the legs were black-streaked brown. The eyes had grey <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> and blue <a href="pupil">pupil</a>s. Rail chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, so the chicks were assumed to be only a day or two old.

Bird species with a restricted <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> are especially vulnerable to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost a quarter of all rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.

Habitat loss has occurred through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest was in an area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending the area in which this bird has been seen in recent years.

Zapata rail

The Zapata rail ("Cyanolimnas cerverai") is a medium-sized, dark-coloured <a href="Rallidae">rail</a>, the only member of the <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus Cyanolimnas. It has brown upperparts, greyish-blue underparts, a red-based yellow <a href="Beak">bill</a>, white undertail <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">covert</a>s, and red eyes and legs. Its short wings render it almost <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless</a>. It is <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the wetlands of the <a href="Zapata%20Peninsula">Zapata Peninsula</a> in southern <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, where its only known nest was found in <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> <a href="tussock%20%28grass%29">tussocks</a>. Little is known of its diet or reproductive behaviour, and its described calls may belong to a different species.

The species was discovered by Spanish zoologist <a href="Ferm%C3%ADn%20Zan%C3%B3n%20Cervera">Fermín Zanón Cervera</a> in March 1927 in the <a href="Zapata%20Swamp">Zapata Swamp</a> near Santo Tomás, in the southern <a href="Matanzas%20Province">Matanzas Province</a> of Cuba. The swamp holds one other bird found nowhere else, the <a href="Zapata%20wren">Zapata wren</a>, and also gives its name to the <a href="Zapata%20sparrow">Zapata sparrow</a>. Due to ongoing <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a> in its limited range, its small population size, and <a href="predation">predation</a> by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, the Zapata rail is evaluated as <a href="Critically%20Endangered">critically endangered</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of threatened species. Tourism and climate change may pose threats in the future.

The Zapata rail was formally described by American <a href="herpetology">herpetologist</a> <a href="Thomas%20Barbour">Thomas Barbour</a> and his compatriot, ornithologist <a href="James%20Lee%20Peters">James Lee Peters</a>, in 1927. They considered it distinctive enough to merit its own genus, "Cyanolimnas". The genus name derives from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "kuanos" "dark blue" and <a href="New%20Latin">Modern Latin</a> "limnas" "rail or crake"; the <a href="species">specific name</a> "cerverai" honours the rail's discoverer, <a href="Ferm%C3%ADn%20Zan%C3%B3n%20Cervera">Fermín Zanón Cervera</a>, a Spanish soldier who had stayed on after the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and became a professional naturalist.

Barbour had been accompanied by the Spaniard on his previous visits to Cuba, and on hearing of the strange birds to be found in the Zapata area, he sent Cervera on a series of trips into the region. Cervera eventually found the rail near the very small settlement which is commemorated in the Spanish name for the rail, "Gallinuela de Santo Tomás". Cervera also discovered the Zapata wren and the Zapata sparrow, and his name is commemorated by the new ecological centre in the Ciénaga de Zapata National Park.

The rail family contains more than 150 species divided into at least 50 genera, the exact number depending on the authority. The Zapata rail is the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">only member</a> of the genus "Cyanolimnas", and is considered to be intermediate between two other New World genera, "<a href="Mustelirallus">Mustelirallus</a>" and "<a href="Pardirallus">Pardirallus</a>". All six species in the three genera are long-billed, five have drab <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, and all but one have a red spot at the bill base. They are believed to be descended from "<a href="Amaurornis">Amaurornis</a>"-like ancestral stock.

This is a medium-sized, dark rail, approximately 29 cm (11.4 in) long. The upperparts are olive-brown and the forehead, head sides and underparts are slate-grey, with some white barring on the lower belly. The flanks are grey-brown and the undertail is white. The iris, legs and feet are red, and the bill is yellow with a red base. The tail feathers are only sparsely barbed, and the wings are very short and rounded. The sexes are similar in appearance, but immature birds are duller and have olive feet and bill; the chicks, as with all rails, are covered with blackish <a href="down%20feather">down</a>. The Zapata rail's call is described as a bouncing "cutucutu-cutucutu-cutucutu" similar to that of the <a href="bare-legged%20owl">bare-legged owl</a>, and a loud <a href="limpkin">limpkin-like</a> "kuvk kuck". However, these calls may actually be those of the <a href="spotted%20rail">spotted rail</a>.

There are no similar species in Cuba; the <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> spotted rail is much the same size, but is heavily spotted and barred with white. The Zapata rail's plumage is intermediate between those of the <a href="Colombian%20crake">Colombian crake</a> and the <a href="plumbeous%20rail">plumbeous rail</a>, but these are mainland birds of Central and South America.

This rail is a Cuban endemic restricted to the northern part of the 4500 km (1740 mi) Zapata Swamp, which is also the only location for the <a href="Zapata%20wren">Zapata wren</a>, and the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> of the <a href="Zapata%20sparrow">Zapata sparrow</a>. The favoured habitat of the Zapata rail is flooded vegetation, 1.5–2.0 m (60–80 in) tall, consisting of tangled, bush-covered swamp and low trees, and preferably near higher ground. Typical plants of the swamp are <a href="Myrica%20cerifera">wax myrtle</a>, the <a href="willow">willow</a> "Salix longipes", the <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> "<a href="Cladium%20jamaicensis">Cladium jamaicensis</a>", and the <a href="Typha%20angustifolia">narrow leaf cattail</a>.

The species was once more widespread, with fossil bones found at Havana, <a href="Pinar%20del%20R%C3%ADo">Pinar del Río</a> and the <a href="Isla%20de%20la%20Juventud">Isla de la Juventud</a>. Barbour did not believe that the rail, Zapata sparrow and Zapata wren were relics in the sense that they once ranged widely over Cuba (as did, for example, the <a href="dwarf%20hutia">dwarf hutia</a> and the <a href="Cuban%20crocodile">Cuban crocodile</a>), since the birds are so highly modified for swamp conditions. He considered that conditions similar to those found today may once have extended over the large submerged area now represented by the shallow banks, with scattered <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> keys, which stretch towards the Isla de la Juventud and perhaps eastward along the southern Cuban coast. The birds fossilized at Isla de la Juventud are smaller than the single extant specimen, but the paucity of available material makes it impossible to establish whether the populations were genuinely different.

The Zapata rail usually breeds in "Cladium jamaicensis" sawgrass, building the nest above water-level on a raised tussock. Breeding occurs around September, and possibly also in December and January. American <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="James%20Bond%20%28ornithologist%29">James Bond</a> found a nest containing three white eggs 60 cm (2 ft) above water level in sawgrass, but little else is known of the breeding biology. Rails are usually <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, and all have <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks which are fed and guarded by the adults.

The bird prefers to feed in sawgrass. The diet is not recorded, but most marsh rails are <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>, feeding on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s and plant material. The rails may disperse in the <a href="wet%20season">rainy season</a>, returning to permanently flooded areas in the dry months.

Like other rails, this species is difficult to observe as it moves through the sawgrass, and may crouch to avoid detection, but is not usually particularly wary. When disturbed, it may run a short distance and then stop with its tail raised and the conspicuous white undertail showing. Despite its short wings, the Zapata rail may not be completely flightless. On <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> grounds it would be classed as a flightless species, since the <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> and wing are as reduced as in other species of rails that are considered to be flightless, but Bond reported that he saw one flutter about ten feet across a canal.

Island species of rails are particularly vulnerable to population loss since they frequently and rapidly evolve to become flightless or very weak fliers, and are very susceptible to introduced predators. Fifteen species have become extinct since 1600, and more than 30 are endangered.

The species appears to have been easily found in the Santo Tomás area until 1931, but there were no further records until the 1970s when birds were found 65 km (40 mi) away at Laguna del Tesoro. The few records in subsequent years suggest that numbers remain low, although after no official sightings for two decades, a 1998 survey found the birds at two new locations in the Zapata Swamp. Ten rails were detected at Peralta, and seven at Hato de Jicarita. On the basis of this sample it was estimated that 70–90 rails were present in the 230 hectares (570 acres) between the two sites. As of 2016, the only sighting for several years was in November 2014.

The Zapata rail is restricted to a single area, with an extent of about 1,000 km (400 mi), and its small population, estimated on the basis of recent surveys and local assessments of population densities at 250–1,000 individuals, is assessed as decreasing. In the past, grass-cutting for roof thatch was a cause of extensive loss of breeding habitat, and habitat loss through dry-season burning of the vegetation continues. Predation by introduced <a href="small%20Asian%20mongoose">small Asian mongoose</a>s and rats is a problem and, more recently, introduced <a href="Clarias%20gariepinus">African sharptooth catfish</a> ("Clarias gariepinus") have been identified as major predators of rail chicks.

"C. cerverai" was classified as <a href="endangered">endangered</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> until 2011, when its status was uplisted to <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a>. This had already been suggested since, given the lack of knowledge about its calls, the rail's population may be lower than currently estimated.

Two remaining sites are in protected areas: the Corral de Santo Tomás Faunal Refuge, and the Laguna del Tesoro nature tourism area. Surveys have recently been conducted throughout the species' range and proposed <a href="conservation%20area">conservation</a> measures include the control of dry season burning.

Cuba has plans to encourage more tourists, including to the Zapata area, and changes to United States policy mean that its citizens are allowed to visit Cuba. In the future, this could further increase the effects of <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>; this might have a dangerous impact on the wetland, but there are ways in which the impact of mass tourism can be mitigated.

In the longer term, the <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar-listed</a> swamp itself may be threatened. Rising sea levels due to global warming could contaminate the wetland with saltwater, damaging the plants and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>, and by 2100 the area of Ciénaga de Zapata would be reduced by one-fifth. Higher ocean temperatures resulting from climate change could also lead to stronger hurricanes and drought. Bouza warned that the fallen vegetation left by hurricanes could act as fuel for further damaging fires once it had dried out.

Snoring rail

The snoring rail ("Aramidopsis plateni"), also known as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail, is a large flightless <a href="Rallidae">rail</a> and the only member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> Aramidopsis. The species is <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and it is found exclusively in dense vegetation in wet areas of <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> and nearby <a href="Buton">Buton</a>. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a <a href="rufous">rufous</a> patch on the hind-neck. The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>. The typical call is the snoring: "ee-orrrr" sound that gives the bird its English name.

Its inaccessible <a href="habitat">habitat</a> and retiring nature mean that the snoring rail is rarely seen and as a result, little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a> (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and <a href="predation">predation</a> by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>; it is therefore evaluated as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The <a href="Rallidae">rails</a> are a large and very widespread family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct <a href="taxon">taxa</a> restricted to islands, 32 have lost the ability to fly.

The snoring rail was first classified as "Rallus plateni" by German ornithologist <a href="August%20Wilhelm%20Heinrich%20Blasius">August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius</a> in 1886, but was moved to its current <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus "Aramidopsis" by English zoologist <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a> in 1893. Following Taylor (1998), it was considered to be more similar to the <a href="Inaccessible%20Island%20rail">Inaccessible Island</a> and <a href="white-throated%20rail">white-throated rail</a>s than to members of the genus "<a href="Rallus">Rallus</a>", but a 2012 <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l <a href="gene">gene</a> study suggests that it should actually be placed in "<a href="Gallirallus">Gallirallus</a>", with <a href="Lewin%27s%20rail">Lewin's rail</a> and the <a href="slaty-breasted%20rail">slaty-breasted rail</a> as its closest relatives.

" Aramidopsis " derives from the genus name of the <a href="limpkin">limpkin</a>, "Aramus" and the Greek suffix "opsis", "resembling". Although the rail shares the origin of its name with the South American "<a href="Aramides">Aramides</a>" species, its distinctive bill, thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group. The species name " plateni" commemorates <a href="Carl%20Constantin%20Platen">Carl Constantin Platen</a>, a German doctor who collected birds and butterflies in the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a> and gave Blasius his specimen of the rail. The common name refers to the rail's distinctive call, and was given to the bird as "der Vogel Schnarch" (the snoring bird) by German <a href="entomology">entomologist</a> <a href="Gerd%20Heinrich">Gerd Heinrich</a> when he rediscovered the species in 1932.

The snoring rail is long and weighs . It is flightless, with short wings, a very short tail and strong legs and feet. The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey, apart from a white chin, and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange-red. Most of the rest of the upperparts are brown, and the belly, flanks, and undertail have white barring. The male has black legs, a yellow <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and a brown and greenish down-curved bill. The female is similar but has a brighter hindneck colour, less white on the chin, a red iris, a cream and reddish bill and blue-grey legs. Immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed. Visual confusion with <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> rails is unlikely. The <a href="blue-faced%20rail">blue-faced rail</a> is similar in size, but is chestnut above and black below, and the <a href="buff-banded%20rail">buff-banded rail</a> has strongly marked upperparts, breast, and head. The <a href="slaty-breasted%20rail">slaty-breasted rail</a> is smaller and has barred upperparts.

The call, given frequently, is a short "wheez" followed by a distinctive snoring "ee-orrrr". A deep "hmmmm" sound has also been recorded.

The species is an uncommon Indonesian <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> of lowland and hill forests in northern, north central and southeastern <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>. Another population was found on <a href="Buton">Buton</a> island in 1995.

The typical habitat of this species is dense vegetation in wet areas. This may include impenetrable <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> and <a href="liana">liana</a> in forests, <a href="rattan">rattan</a> in regrown forests, or <a href="Miscanthus%20sinensis">elephant grass</a> and bushes on the hillsides of <a href="Minahassa%20Peninsula">Minahassa Peninsula</a>. Claims of the species occurring in rice fields are believed to be due to confusion with the buff-banded rail. The snoring rail occurs from sea level to .

Its inaccessible habitat and sparse distribution means that little is known about this species. A few birds were shot by Platen and another expedition led by <a href="Paul%20Sarasin">Paul Sarasin</a> and his second cousin, <a href="Fritz%20Sarasin">Fritz</a>, between 1893 and 1898, but the rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until Heinrich found it almost at the end of a two-year survey of Sulawesi, then known as Celebes. He described it as "the most priceless catch that I have ever hunted or will hunt". More than a decade later, Dutch ornithologist Louis Coomans de Ruiter also took a year to find the rail, despite concentrating on known suitable habitat. There were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989. Sight records remain infrequent, and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied.

The snoring rail catches crabs in highland streams, and these crustaceans may be a major dietary item. It also forages in muddy areas, and has been recorded as consuming lizards. Nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983, but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting.

The snoring rail is restricted to Sulawesi and Buton and has an estimated population of 3,500–15,000 individuals. Its numbers are thought to be decreasing, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

It may always have been thinly spread, but there has been widespread deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large <a href="Lore%20Lindu%20National%20Park">Lore Lindu</a> and <a href="Bogani%20Nani%20Wartabone%20National%20Park">Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park</a>s are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.

Sophie Blanchard

Sophie Blanchard (25 March 1778 – 6 July 1819), commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard, was a French <a href="aeronautics">aeronaut</a> and the wife of <a href="Balloon%20%28aircraft%29">ballooning</a> pioneer <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Blanchard">Jean-Pierre Blanchard</a>. Blanchard was the first woman to work as a professional balloonist, and after her husband's death she continued ballooning, making more than 60 ascents. Known throughout Europe for her ballooning exploits, Blanchard entertained <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, who promoted her to the role of "Aeronaut of the Official Festivals", replacing <a href="Andr%C3%A9-Jacques%20Garnerin">André-Jacques Garnerin</a>. On the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1814 she performed for <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a>, who named her "Official Aeronaut of the Restoration".

Ballooning was a risky business for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, she became the first woman to be killed in an <a href="Aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents">aviation accident</a> when, during an exhibition in the <a href="Jardin%20de%20Tivoli%2C%20Paris">Tivoli Gardens</a> in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death.

Sophie Blanchard was born Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at <a href="Trois-Canons">Trois-Canons</a>, near <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a>. Little is known of her life before her marriage to <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Blanchard">Jean-Pierre Blanchard</a>, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's "small, ugly, nervous wife", "small with sharp bird-like features" and later as "small and beautiful", Sophie was more at home in the sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. She was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.

Sophie made her first ascent in a balloon with Blanchard in <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> on 27 December 1804. The couple faced bankruptcy as a result of Blanchard's poor business sense, and they believed a female balloonist was a novelty that might attract enough attention to solve their financial problems. She described the feeling as an "incomparable sensation" (""sensation incomparable""). Sophie made a second ascent with Blanchard and for her third ascent on 18 August 1805, she flew solo from the garden of the Cloister of the Jacobins in <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>.

She was not the first woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a trip on a tethered balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, <a href="Citoyenne%20Henri">Citoyenne Henri</a>, who had made an ascent with <a href="Andr%C3%A9-Jacques%20Garnerin">André-Jacques Garnerin</a> in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to <a href="Elizabeth%20Thible">Elizabeth Thible</a>. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain <a href="Gustav%20III%20of%20Sweden">Gustav III of Sweden</a> in <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning as a career.

In 1809, her husband died from injuries sustained when he fell from his balloon in the <a href="Hague">Hague</a> after suffering a heart attack. After his death, Sophie continued to make ascents, specialising in night flights, often staying aloft all night.

Sophie conducted experiments with parachutes as her husband had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, and as part of her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, <a href="%C3%89lisa%20Garnerin">Élisa Garnerin</a>, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.

The couple had still been in debt at the time of Blanchard's death, so to minimise her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>-filled <a href="gas%20balloon">gas balloon</a> (or "Charlière"), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a>. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Having a smaller, easily inflatable balloon was also important in an era when "balloon riots" were common, and disappointed crowds were known to destroy balloons and attack aeronauts when balloons failed to go up as planned. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel <a href="Francis%20Maceroni">Francis Maceroni</a> recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.

She became a favourite of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, and he appointed her to replace André-Jacques Garnerin in 1804. Garnerin had disgraced himself by failing to control the balloon that he had sent up to mark Napoleon's coronation in Paris; the balloon eventually drifted as far as Rome, where it crashed into the <a href="Lake%20Bracciano">Lago di Bracciano</a> and became the subject of many jokes at Napoleon's expense. The title given to her by Napoleon is unclear: he certainly made her "Aeronaut of the Official Festivals" (""Aéronaute des Fêtes Officielles"") with responsibility for organising ballooning displays at major events, but he may have also made her his Chief Air Minister of Ballooning, in which role she is reported to have drawn up plans for an <a href="Napoleon%27s%20invasion%20of%20England">aerial invasion of England</a>. She was able to dissuade Napoleon from this impractical plan by pointing out that the prevailing winds over the Channel made such an invasion nearly impossible. 

She made ascents for Napoleon's entertainment on 24 June 1810 from the <a href="Champ%20de%20Mars">Champ de Mars</a> in Paris and at the celebration mounted by the <a href="Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29">Imperial Guard</a> for his marriage to <a href="Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma">Marie-Louise of Austria</a>. On the birth of Napoleon's <a href="Napoleon%20II%20of%20France">son</a>, Blanchard took a balloon flight over Paris from the Champs de Mars and threw out leaflets proclaiming the birth. She performed at the official celebration of his <a href="baptism">baptism</a> at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Saint-Cloud">Château de Saint-Cloud</a> on 23 June 1811, with a firework display launched from the balloon, and again at the "Féte de l'Emperor" in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> on 15 August 1811. She made an ascent in bad weather over the Campo Marte in Naples to accompany the review of the troops by Napoleon's brother-in-law <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, the King of Naples, in 1811. When <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a> entered Paris on 4 May 1814 after being <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restored</a> to the French throne, Blanchard ascended in her balloon from the <a href="Pont%20Neuf">Pont Neuf</a> as part of the triumphal procession. Louis was so taken with her performance that he dubbed her "Official Aeronaut of the Restoration".

Known throughout Europe, Blanchard drew large crowds for her ascents. In <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> she was apparently the cause of the poor reception of <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Carl Maria von Weber</a>'s opera "<a href="Silvana%20%28opera%29">Silvana</a>" on its opening night, 16 September 1810: the people of the city flocked to see her demonstration while only a few attended the opera's debut. She gave many displays in Italy. In 1811 she travelled from Rome to <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, splitting the journey in half with a stop after 60 miles (97 km), and later ascended again from Rome to a height of 12,000 feet (3,660 m) where she claimed that she fell into a profound sleep for a while before landing at <a href="Tagliacozzo">Tagliacozzo</a>. In the same year she again lost consciousness after having to ascend to avoid being trapped in a <a href="hail">hail</a>storm near <a href="Vincennes">Vincennes</a>. She spent 14½ hours in the air as a result. Sophie crossed the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> by balloon, and on a trip to <a href="Turin">Turin</a> on 26 April 1812 the temperature dropped so low that she suffered a nose bleed and icicles formed on her hands and face. She almost died on 21 September 1817 when, on a flight from <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> (her 53rd), she mistook a marshy field for a safe landing spot. The canopy of her balloon became caught in a tree which caused the chair to tip over; Blanchard, entangled in the rigging, was forced into the water of the marsh and would have drowned had not help arrived soon after her landing. Sympathising with <a href="Marie-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20Charlotte%20de%20Lamourous">Marie Thérèse de Lamourous</a> who was attempting to run a shelter for "fallen women" ("La Miséricorde") in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, she offered to donate the proceeds from one of her ascents to the venture. De Lamourous refused the offer on the grounds that she could not be the cause of another risking their life.

On 6 July 1819, the <a href="Jardin%20de%20Tivoli%2C%20Paris">Tivoli Gardens</a> in Paris, her hydrogen-filled balloon caught fire and Blanchard, entangled in the surrounding net, fell to her death. She was reported to be unusually nervous before starting this ascent.

Blanchard had performed regularly at the Tivoli Gardens, making ascents twice a week when she was in Paris. She had been warned repeatedly of the danger of using fireworks in her exhibitions. This display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual, and it appears that the warnings had made an impression on her. Some spectators implored her not to make the ascent, but others, eager to see the show, urged her on. One report suggested that she finally made up her mind and stepped into her chair with the words ""Allons, ce sera pour la dernière fois"" ("Let's go, this will be for the last time").

At about 10:30 p.m. (accounts differ as to the exact time), Blanchard began her ascent, carrying a white flag and wearing a white dress and a white hat topped with ostrich plumes. The wind was blowing strongly, and it appears the balloon struggled to rise. By shedding ballast Blanchard managed to get some lift, but the balloon brushed through the trees as it ascended. Once she had cleared the treetops Blanchard began the display by waving her flag. The balloon was illuminated by baskets containing "<a href="Bengal%20fire">Bengal fire</a>", a slow-burning, coloured pyrotechnic.

A few moments after beginning the display, and while still ascending, the balloon was seen to be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events were part of the show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that "several arteries had snapt through the effort." 
Just above the rooftops of the Rue de Provence the balloon's gas was exhausted, and the craft struck the roof of a house. It was thought likely that she would have survived had that been the end of the incident, but the ropes holding the chair to the body of the balloon may have burnt through, or the impact may have thrown her forwards, with the result that Blanchard, trapped in the netting of the balloon, pitched over the side of the roof into the street below. John Poole, an eyewitness, described her final moments:

Some reports credit her with crying out ""À moi"!" ("help", or literally, "to me"), as she struck the roof. Although the crowds rushed to her assistance and attempts were made to save her, she had either died instantly, from a broken neck, or at most ten minutes later.

The most likely cause of the accident seemed to be that the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.

<a href="Norwich%20Duff">Norwich Duff</a>, who had witnessed Blanchard's ascent and the accident, recorded:

On hearing she had died, the proprietors of the Tivoli Gardens immediately announced that the admission fees would be donated for the support of her children, and some spectators stood at the gates appealing to the citizens of Paris for donations. The appeal raised 2,400 <a href="french%20franc">francs</a>, but after the collection it was discovered that she had no surviving children, so the money was used instead to erect a memorial, topped with a representation of her balloon in flames, above her grave in <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>. Her tombstone was engraved with the epitaph ""victime de son art et de son intrépidité"" ("victim of her art and intrepidity"). The remainder of the money, about 1,000 francs, was donated to the <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> "" which Blanchard had attended. Though not rich, at the time of her death she had cleared the debts left to her by her husband and was financially secure. Each of her ascents had cost her around 1,000 francs, not including the cost of maintenance of the balloon. In her will she left property worth between 1,000 and 50,000 francs to the daughter of some acquaintances. In total, she had made 67 balloon ascents.

The story of her death was recounted throughout Europe. <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> mentioned her in "<a href="Five%20Weeks%20in%20a%20Balloon">Five Weeks in a Balloon</a>" and, in "<a href="The%20Gambler%20%28novel%29">The Gambler</a>", <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> likened the thrill of committing oneself in gambling to the sensation that Blanchard must have felt as she fell. For others, her death proved a cautionary tale, either as an example of a woman exceeding her station (as with <a href="Grenville%20Mellen">Grenville Mellen</a>, who said that it proved "a woman in a balloon is either out of her element or too high in it") or as the price of vanity for attempting such spectacular shows. <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> commented "The jug goes often to the well, but is pretty sure to get cracked at last". With the advent of powered flight, ballooning and Blanchard's story were relegated to the margins of aviation history. A novel inspired by Blanchard's story, Linda Donn's "The Little Balloonist", was published in 2006.

Nothomyrmecia

Nothomyrmecia, also known as the dinosaur ant or dawn ant, is a rare <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="ant">ant</a>s consisting of a single <a href="species">species</a>, Nothomyrmecia macrops. These ants live in South Australia, nesting in old-growth <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee</a> woodland and "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" woodland. The full distribution of "Nothomyrmecia" has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread the species truly is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour <a href="Old-growth%20forest">old-growth</a> mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. "Nothomyrmecia" is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as "<a href="carpenter%20ant">Camponotus</a>" and "<a href="Iridomyrmex">Iridomyrmex</a>", and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> lists the ant as <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>.

As a medium-sized ant, "Nothomyrmecia" measures . Workers are <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">monomorphic</a>, showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a> and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as <a href="Honeydew%20%28secretion%29">honeydew</a> from <a href="scale%20insect">scale insect</a>s and other <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are <a href="Voltinism">univoltine</a> (they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared.

"Nothomyrmecia" was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> by Australian entomologist <a href="John%20S.%20Clark">John S. Clark</a> in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from <a href="Israelite%20Bay%2C%20Western%20Australia">Israelite Bay</a> in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the '<a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a>' of <a href="myrmecology">myrmecology</a>, the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world. In <a href="Poochera%2C%20South%20Australia">Poochera</a> (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stencilled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the <a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic Eocene fossil</a> ant genus "<a href="Prionomyrmex">Prionomyrmex</a>" based on <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, "Nothomyrmecia" is regarded to be the most <a href="plesiomorphic">plesiomorphic</a> ant alive and a '<a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes.

"Nothomyrmecia" is a medium-sized ant measuring in length. Workers are <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">monomorphic</a>, meaning that there is little morphological differentiation among one another. The mandibles, <a href="Clypeus%20%28arthropod%20anatomy%29">clypeus</a> (one of the <a href="sclerite">sclerite</a>s that make up the "face" of an arthropod or insect), antennae and legs are pale yellow. The hairs on the body are yellow, erect and long and abundant, but on the antennae and legs they are shorter and suberect (standing almost in an erect position). It shows similar characteristics to "<a href="Myrmecia%20%28ant%29">Myrmecia</a>", and somewhat resembles "<a href="Oecophylla">Oecophylla</a>", commonly known as weaver ants. Workers are strictly <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a> (active mainly at night) but navigate by vision, relying on large <a href="Eye%23Compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a>. The mandibles are shorter than the head. They have 10 to 15 intermeshing teeth and are less specialised than those of "Myrmecia" and "<a href="Prionomyrmex">Prionomyrmex</a>", being elongate and triangular. The head is longer than it is wide and broader towards the back. The sides of the head are convex around the eyes. The long antennal <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29%23Structure">scape</a>s (the base of the antenna) extend beyond the occipital border, and the second <a href="Segmentation%20%28biology%29">segment</a> of the <a href="Pedicel%20%28antenna%29">funiculus</a> (a series of segments between the base and <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29%23Structure">club</a>) is slightly longer than the first, third and fourth segment. The node, <a href="pronotum">pronotum</a>, <a href="propodeum">epinotum</a> and thorax are longer than broad, and the <a href="mesonotum">mesonotum</a> is just as long as it is wide. The first segment of the <a href="Gaster%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">gaster</a> (the bulbous posterior portion of the <a href="metasoma">metasoma</a>) is broader than long by a third and broader at the back than the front with strongly convex sides.

A long and retractable <a href="stinger">stinger</a> is present at the rear of the abdomen. It has been described as "prominent and effective" and is capable of inflicting a painful sting to humans. A 'sting bulb gland' is also present in "Nothomyrmecia"; this is a small <a href="exocrine%20gland">exocrine gland</a> of unknown function, first discovered and named in 1990. It is situated in the basal part of the insect's sting, and is located between the two ducts of the venom gland and the <a href="Dufour%27s%20gland">Dufour's gland</a>. Despite its many <a href="Primitive%20%28phylogenetics%29">plesiomorphic</a> features, the <a href="Stinger%23Arthropods">sting apparatus</a> of "Nothomyrmecia" is considered less primitive than those found in other ants such as "<a href="Stigmatomma%20pallipes">Stigmatomma pallipes</a>". It is the only known species of ant that contains both a sting and a 'waist' (i.e. it has no <a href="Petiole%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">postpetiole</a> between the first and second gastral segments).
Queens look similar to workers, but several morphological features distinguish the two castes from each other. The queen's body is usually larger. <a href="Ocelli">Ocelli</a> are highly developed, but the eyes on the queen are not enlarged. The structure of the pterothorax (the wing-bearing area of the thorax) is consistent with other reproductive ants, but it does not occupy as much of its mesosomal bulk. The wings of the queens are reduced to the point that they are not functional (they are <a href="Brachyptery">brachypterous</a>). Their wings are rudimentary and stubby, barely overlapping the first gastral segment. Males resemble those of "Myrmecia", but "Nothomyrmecia" males bear a single waist node. The wings on the male ant are not stubby like a queen's; rather they are long and fully developed, exhibiting a primitive <a href="wikt%3Avenation">venational complement</a>. They have a jugal anal lobe (a portion of the hindwing), a feature found in many primitive ants, and basal <a href="Hamulus%23Arthropoda">hamuli</a> (hook-like projections that link the forewings and hindwings). Most male specimens collected have two <a href="Arthropod%20leg%23Tibia">tibial spur</a>s (spines located on the distal end of the tibia); the first spur is a long <a href="calcar">calcar</a> and the second spur is short and thick. Adults have a <a href="Stridulation">stridulatory</a> organ on the ventral side of the abdomen – unlike all other <a href="hymenoptera">hymenoptera</a>ns in which such organs are located dorsally.

In all castes, these ants have six maxillary <a href="Pedipalp">palp</a>s (palps that serve as organs of touch and taste in feeding) and four labial palps (sensory structures on the <a href="Insect%20mouthparts%23Labium">labium</a>), a highly primitive feature. The females have a 12-segmented antenna, whereas males have 13 segments. Other features include paired calcariae found on both the hind and middle tibiae, and the claws have a median tooth. The unspecialised nature of the <a href="Arthropod%20cuticle">cuticle</a> (outer exoskeleton of the body) is similar to "<a href="Pseudomyrmex">Pseudomyrmex</a>", a member of the subfamily <a href="Pseudomyrmecinae">Pseudomyrmecinae</a>. Many of the features known in "Nothomyrmecia" are found in Ponerinae and Pseudomyrmecinae.
The eggs of "Nothomyrmecia" are similar to those of "Myrmecia", being subspherical and non-adhesive. The larvae bear a primitive body structure with no specialised <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a>s, sharing similar characteristics with the subfamily Ponerinae, but the <a href="Sensillum">sensilla</a> are more abundant on the mouthparts. The larvae are characterised into three stages: very young, young, and mature, measuring , and , respectively. The cocoons have thin walls and produce meconium (a metabolic waste product expelled through the anal opening after an insect emerges from its pupal stage). The cuticular <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s have internally branched <a href="alkenes">alkenes</a>, a feature rarely found in ants and most insects.

In general, the body structure of all "Nothomyrmecia" castes demonstrates the primitive nature of the species. Notable <a href="Synapomorphy">derived features</a> include vestigial ocelli on workers, brachypterous queens, and the <a href="Mesothorax">mesoscutal structure</a> on males. The morphology of the abdomen, mandibles, gonoforceps (a sclerite, serving as the base of the <a href="ovipositor">ovipositor</a>s sheath) and basal hamuli show it is more primitive than "Myrmecia". The structure of the abdominal region can separate it from other Myrmeciinae relatives (the fourth abdominal segment of "Myrmecia" is tubulate, whereas "Nothomyrmecia" has a non-tubulated abdominal segment). The appearance of the fourth abdominal segment is consistent with almost all <a href="Aculeata">aculeate</a> insects, and possibly "<a href="Sphecomyrma">Sphecomyrma</a>".

The feature of non-functional, vestigial wings may have evolved in this species relatively recently, as wings might otherwise have long-since disappeared completely had they no function for dispersal. Wing-reduction could somehow relate to population structure or some other specialised ecological pressure. Equally, wing-reduction might be a feature that only forms in drought-stressed colonies, as has been observed in several "<a href="Monomorium">Monomorium</a>" ant species found throughout semi-arid regions of Australia. As yet, scientists do not fully understand how the feature of non-functional, vestigial wings arose in "Nothomyrmecia macrops".

The first collection of "Nothomyrmecia" was made in December 1931 by amateur entomologist, Amy Crocker, whose colleagues had collected a range of insect samples for her during a field excursion, including specimens of two worker ants, reportedly near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. Crocker then passed the ants to Australian entomologist <a href="John%20S.%20Clark">John S. Clark</a>. Recognised shortly afterwards as a new species, these specimens became the <a href="syntype">syntype</a>s. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor subsequently expressed doubt about the accuracy of recording of the original discovery site, stating the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a>, south from <a href="Balladonia%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balladonia</a>. The discovery of "Nothomyrmecia" and the appearance of its unique body structure led scientists in 1951 to initiate a series of searches to find the ant in Western Australia. Over three decades, teams of Australian and American collectors failed to re-find it; entomologists such as <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> and William Brown, Jr., made attempts to search for it, but neither was successful. Then, on 22 October 1977, Taylor and his party of entomologists from Canberra serendipitously discovered a solitary worker ant at <a href="Poochera%2C%20South%20Australia">Poochera, South Australia</a>, southeast of <a href="Ceduna%2C%20South%20Australia">Ceduna</a>, some from the reported site of the 1931 discovery. In 2012, a report discussing the possible presence of "Nothomyrmecia" in Western Australia did not confirm any sighting of the ant between Balladonia and the Western Australian coastal regions. After 46 years of searching for it, entomologists have dubbed the ant the '<a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a>' of <a href="myrmecology">myrmecology</a>.

In 1934 entomologist John S. Clark published a formal <a href="species%20description">description</a> of "Nothomyrmecia macrops" as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe (Nothomyrmecii) of the <a href="Ponerinae">Ponerinae</a>. He did so because the two specimens (which then became the syntypes) bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of, but they did share similar morphological characteristics with the extinct genus "Prionomyrmex". Clark notes that the head and mandibles of "Nothomyrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex" are somewhat similar, but the two can be distinguished by the appearance of the node (a segment between the <a href="mesosoma">mesosoma</a> and gaster). In 1951, Clark proposed the new ant subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his "Nothomyrmecia", based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants. This proposal was rejected by American entomologist William Brown Jr., who placed it in the subfamily <a href="Myrmeciinae">Myrmeciinae</a> with "Myrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex", under the tribe Nothomyrmeciini. Its distant relationship with extant ants was confirmed after its rediscovery, and its placement within the Formicidae was accepted by most scientists until the late 1980s. The single waist node led scientists to believe that "Nothomyrmecia" should be separate from "Myrmecia" and retained Clark's original proposal. This proposal would place the ant into its own subfamily, despite many familiar morphological characteristics between the two genera. This separation from "Myrmecia" was retained until 2000.
In 2000, entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil "Prionomyrmex" species ("P. janzeni"). After examining specimens of "Nothomyrmecia", Baroni Urbani stated that his new species and "N. macrops" were so morphologically similar that they belonged to the same genus. He proposed that the name "Prionomyrmex" should replace the name "Nothomyrmecia" (which would then be just a synonym), and also that the subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae should be called Prionomyrmeciinae.

In 2003, Russian palaeoentomologists G. M. Dlussky and E. B. Perfilieva separated "Nothomyrmecia" from "Prionomyrmex" on the basis of the fusion of an abdominal segment. In the same year, American entomologists P. S. Ward and S. G. Brady reached the same conclusion as Dlussky and Perfilieva and provided strong support for the <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> of "Prionomyrmex". Ward and Brady also transferred both taxa as distinct genera in the older subfamily Myrmeciinae under the tribe <a href="Prionomyrmecini">Prionomyrmecini</a>. In 2005 and 2008, Baroni Urbani suggested further evidence in favour of his former interpretation as opposed to Ward and Brady's. This view is not supported in subsequent relevant papers, which continue to use the classification of Ward and Brady, rejecting that of Baroni Urbani.

The ant is commonly known as the dinosaur ant, dawn ant, or <a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a> ant because of its plesiomorphic body structure. The generic name "Nothomyrmecia" means "false bulldog ant". Its <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a>, "macrops" ("big eyes"), is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words ', meaning "long", or "large", and ', meaning "eyes".

Studies show that all <a href="hymenoptera">hymenoptera</a>n insects that have a <a href="Ploidy">diploid</a> (2n) chromosome count above 52 are themselves all ants; "Nothomyrmecia" and another Ponerinae ant, "<a href="Platythyrea%20tricuspidata">Platythyrea tricuspidata</a>", share the highest number of chromosomes within all the Hymenoptera, having a diploid chromosome number of 92–94.

Genetic evidence suggests that the age of the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> for "Nothomyrmecia" and "Myrmecia" is approximately 74 million years old, giving a likely origin in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. There are two hypotheses of the internal phylogeny of "Nothomyrmecia": subfamily <a href="Formicinae">Formicinae</a> is more closely related to "Nothomyrmecia" than it is to "Myrmecia", evolving from "Nothomyrmecia"-like ancestors. Alternatively, "Nothomyrmecia" and <a href="Aneuretinae">Aneuretinae</a> may have shared a common ancestor; the two most likely separated from each other, and the first formicines evolved from the Aneuretinae instead. Currently, scientists agree that "Nothomyrmecia" most likely evolved from ancestors to the Ponerinae. "Nothomyrmecia" and other primitive ant genera such as "<a href="Amblyopone">Amblyopone</a>" and "Myrmecia" exhibit behaviour similar to a clade of soil-dwelling families of vespoid wasps. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> generated by Canadian entomologist S. B. Archibald and his colleagues shows the possible <a href="phylogenetic%20relationship">phylogenetic position</a> of "Nothomyrmecia" among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. They suggest that "Nothomyrmecia" may be closely related to extinct Myrmeciinae ants such as "<a href="Avitomyrmex">Avitomyrmex</a>", "<a href="Macabeemyrma">Macabeemyrma</a>", "<a href="Prionomyrmex">Prionomyrmex</a>", and "<a href="Ypresiomyrma">Ypresiomyrma</a>".

"Nothomyrmecia" is present in the cool regions of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> within <a href="Mallee%20%28habit%29">mallee</a> woodland and especially <a href="Old-growth%20forest">old-growth</a> areas populated with various "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" species, including "<a href="Eucalyptus%20brachycalyx">Eucalyptus brachycalyx</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20gracilis">E. gracilis</a>" and "<a href="Eucalyptus%20oleosa">E. oleosa</a>". It is possible that it also occurs in Western Australia, from where it was first collected. The full distribution of "Nothomyrmecia" has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is. If it does favour old-growth mallee woodland, it could have the potential for a wider range than is currently known from surveys and museum specimens. In 1998, "Nothomyrmecia" colonies were located in 18 areas along the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a> by a team of entomologists, a stretch of .

Nests are found in degraded limestone soil with "<a href="Callitris">Callitris</a>" trees present. Colony construction only occurs when the soil is moist. Nest entrance holes are difficult to detect as they are only in width, and are located under shallow leaf litter with no mounds or soil deposits present; guards are regularly seen. A single gallery, in diameter, forms inside a "Nothomyrmecia" colony. This gallery descends steeply into the ground towards a somewhat <a href="wikt%3Aelliptical">elliptical</a> and horizontal chamber that is in diameter and in height. This chamber is typically below the soil's surface.

Workers are <a href="nectarivore">nectarivore</a>s and can be found foraging on top of "Eucalyptus" trees, where they search for food and prey for the larvae. Workers are known to consume <a href="hemolymph">hemolymph</a> from the insects they capture, and a queen in a captive colony was observed consuming a fly. Captured prey items are given to larvae, which are carnivorous. The workers search for prey in piles of leaves, killing small arthropods including "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>" flies, <a href="microlepidoptera">microlepidoptera</a>ns and spiderlings. Prey items are usually less than in size, and workers grab them using their mandibles and forelegs, then kill them with their sting. Workers also feed on sweet substances such as honeydew secreted by <a href="scale%20insect">scale insect</a>s and other <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>; one worker alone may feed on these sources for 30 minutes. Pupae may be given to the larvae if a colony has a shortage of food. Workers are able to lay unfertilised eggs specifically to feed the larvae; these are known as <a href="trophic%20egg">trophic egg</a>s. Sometimes the adults, including the queen and other sexually active ants, consume these eggs. Workers <a href="Trophallaxis">transfer food</a> to other nestmates, including winged adults and larvae; the anal droplets are exuded by the larvae, which are taken up by the workers.

Age caste polyethism does not occur in "Nothomyrmecia", where the younger workers act as nurses and tend to the brood and the older workers go out and forage. The only ant known other than "Nothomyrmecia" which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is "Stigmatomma pallipes". Workers are strictly <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, and only emerge from their nests on cold nights. They are most active at temperatures of , and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights. Workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors, including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights. Cold temperatures may also hamper the escape of prey items, so increasing the ants' hunting success. Unless a forager has captured prey, workers stay on trees for the remainder of the night until dawn, possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest. There is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging; instead, workers rely on visual cues to navigate around. Chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances. The ants are solitary foragers. Waste material, such as dead nestmates, cocoon shells, and food remnants, are disposed of far away from the nest.

Workers from different "Nothomyrmecia" colonies are not antagonistic towards one another, so they can forage together on a single tree, and they attack if an outsider tries to enter an underground colony. Ants such as "<a href="Carpenter%20ant">Camponotus</a>" and "<a href="Iridomyrmex">Iridomyrmex</a>" may pose a threat to foragers or to a colony if they try to enter; foraging workers that encounter "Iridomyrmex" ants are vigorously attacked and killed. "Nothomyrmecia" workers counter this by secreting alarm <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s from the mandibular gland and Dufour's gland. Foraging workers also engage in alternative methods to protect themselves from predators. Adopting a posture by opening the jaws in a threatening stance or deliberately falling onto the ground and remaining motionless until the threat subsides are two known methods. With that said, "Nothomyrmecia" is a timid and shy species that retreats if exposed.

<a href="Nuptial%20flight">Nuptial flight</a> (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) does not occur in "Nothomyrmecia". Instead, they engage in long-range dispersal (they walk away from the colony for some distance and mate) which presumably begins by late summer or autumn, with the winged adults emerging around March and April, but sometimes a colony may <a href="Overwintering">overwinter</a> (a process by which an organism waits out the winter season). These winged adults, born around January, are usually quite young when they begin to mate. Queens are seen around vegetation trying to flutter their vestigial wings – a behaviour seen in some brachypterous "Myrmecia" queens. Due to the queen's brachypterous wings, it is likely that the winged adults mate near their parent nest and release sex pheromones, or instead climb on vegetation far away from their nests and attract fully winged males. "Nothomyrmecia" is a <a href="Polyandry%20in%20nature">polyandrous</a> ant, in which queens mate with one or more males. In one study of 32 colonies, it was found that queens mated with an average of 1.37 males. After mating, new colonies can be founded by one or more queens; a colony with two queens reduces to a single queen when the nest is mature, forming colonies that are termed <a href="Gyne">monogynous</a>. The queens will compete for dominance, and the subordinate queen is later expelled by workers who drag her outside the nest. An existing nest with no queen may adopt a foraging queen looking for an area to begin her colony, as well as workers. Queens are semi-claustral, meaning that during the initial establishment of the new colony the queen will forage among the worker ants so that she can ensure sufficient food to raise her brood. Sometimes a queen will leave her nest at night with the sole purpose of finding food or water for herself.

Eggs are not seen in nests from April to September. They are laid by late December and develop into adults by mid-February; pupation does not occur until March. "Nothomyrmecia" is univoltine, meaning that the queen produces a single generation of eggs per season, and it sometimes may take as many as 12 months for an egg to develop into an adult. Adults are defined as either juveniles or post-juveniles: juveniles are too young (perhaps several months old) to have experienced overwintering whereas post-juveniles have. The pupae generally overwinter and begin to hatch by the time a new generation of eggs is laid. Workers are capable of laying reproductive eggs; it is not known if these develop into males, females or both. This uncertainty results from the suggestion that, because some colonies have been shown to have high levels of <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>, worker ants could be inseminated by males and act as supplementary reproductives. Eggs are scattered among the nest, whereas the larvae and pupae are set apart from each other in groups. The larvae are capable of crawling around the nest. When the larvae are ready to spin their cocoons, they swell up and are later buried by workers in the ground to allow cocoon formation. Small non-aggressive workers that act as nurses provide assistance for newborns to hatch from their cocoons. At maturity, a nest may only contain 50 to 100 adults. In some nests, colony founding can occur within a colony itself: when a queen dies, the colony may be taken over by one of her daughters, or it may adopt a newly mated queen, restricting reproduction among workers; this method of founding extends the lifespan of the colony almost indefinitely.

Before its rediscovery in 1977, entomologists feared that "Nothomyrmecia" had already become extinct. The ant was listed as a protected species under the Western Australian <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Act%201950">Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</a>. In 1996, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> listed "Nothomyrmecia" as <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>, stating that only a few small colonies were known. The <a href="Threatened%20Species%20Scientific%20Committee">Threatened Species Scientific Committee</a> states that the species is ineligible for listing under the <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>. This is because there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that populations are declining. Colonies are also naturally depauperate (lacking in numbers of ants), and their distribution is potentially quite extensive across southern Australia, due to the ants' preference for old-growth mallee woodland. With 18 sites known for this species, and the potential for many more being discovered, there seems little immediate possibility of extinction. With this said, it is unknown how widespread the species actually is, and scientists are not yet clear what, if any, threats affect it.

Suspected <a href="Anthropogenic%20hazard">anthropogenic</a> threats that can significantly affect "Nothomyrmecia" include <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a> by railway lines, roads and wheat fields. In the town of Ceduna, west of Poochera, local populations of the ant were almost eliminated after the area was bulldozed and burned during the installation of an underground telephone line, although nearby sites had larger populations than those found in the destroyed site. Colonies may not survive tree-clearing, as they depend on overhead <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopies</a> to navigate. <a href="Wildfire">Bushfire</a>s are another major threat to the survival of "Nothomyrmecia", potentially destroying valuable food sources, including the trees they forage on, and reducing the population of a colony. These ants may have recovered from previous bushfires, but larger, more frequent fires may devastate the population. "Nothomyrmecia" ants can be safe from fires if they remain inside their nests. <a href="Climate%20change">Climate change</a> could be a threat to their survival, as they depend on cold temperatures to forage and collect food. An increase in the temperature will prevent workers from foraging, and very few areas would be suitable for the species to live in. The cold winds blowing off the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> allow "Nothomyrmecia" to benefit from the cool temperatures they need for night-time foraging, so an increase in sea temperature could also potentially threaten it.

Conservationists suggest that conducting surveys, maintaining known populations through habitat protection and fighting climate change may ensure the survival of "Nothomyrmecia". They also advocate protection of remaining mallee habitat from degradation, and for management actions to improve tree and understorey structure. Because most known populations are found outside protected areas in vegetation alongside roads, a species management plan is required to identify other key actions, including making local councils aware of the presence, conservation status and habitat requirement of "Nothomyrmecia". This could result in future land use and management being decided more appropriately at the local level. Not all colonies are found in unprotected areas; some have been discovered in the <a href="Lake%20Gilles%20Conservation%20Park">Lake Gilles Conservation Park</a> and the <a href="Chadinga%20Conservation%20Reserve">Chadinga Conservation Reserve</a>. More research is needed to know the true extent of the ant's geographical distribution.

"Nothomyrmecia macrops" is widely regarded as the most plesiomorphic living ant and, as such, has aroused considerable interest among the entomological community. Following its rediscovery it was the subject of a prolonged and rigorous series of studies involving Australian, American and European ant specialists and it soon became one of the most studied ant species on the planet. "Nothomyrmecia" can be cultured with ease, and could potentially prove a useful subject for research into learning in insects as well as the physiology of nocturnal vision. Since its chance discovery at Poochera, the town has become of international interest to myrmecologists, and it is possibly the only town in the world with ant-based tourism. Promoting it as a tourist attraction, "Nothomyrmecia" has been adopted as the emblem of the Poochera community. Pictures of the ant have been stencilled onto the pavements, and a large sculpture of "Nothomyrmecia" has been erected in the town.

Edmund Herring

<a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Edmund Francis Herring, (2 September 1892 – 5 January 1982) was a senior <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officer during the Second World War, <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor">Lieutenant Governor</a> of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, and <a href="Chief%20Justice">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a>. A <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes scholar</a>, Herring was at <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, when the First World War broke out and served with the <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a> on the <a href="Macedonian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Macedonian front</a>, for which he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. After the war he carved out a successful career as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> and <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a>. He also joined the Australian Army, rising to the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a> by 1939.

During the Second World War, Herring commanded the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> Artillery in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>. In 1942, as a corps commander, he commanded the land forces in the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>. The following year, he directed operations in the <a href="Salamaua-Lae%20campaign">Salamaua-Lae campaign</a> and <a href="Finisterre%20Range%20campaign">Finisterre Range campaign</a>. Herring left his corps to become the longest-serving Chief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of Victoria, serving for three decades. In the latter capacity, he was patron of many charitable organisations.

Edmund Francis Herring, known as Ned to his family, was born in <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Victoria">Maryborough, Victoria</a>, on 2 September 1892, the third of five children of Edmund Selwyn Herring, a solicitor, and his Irish-born wife Gertrude Stella Herring, formerly Fetherstonhaugh. He was educated at Maryborough College and High School and at <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar">Melbourne Grammar</a>, where he excelled at tennis and <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, and was both <a href="School%20Captain">School Captain</a> and <a href="Dux">Dux</a> in 1910. While at Melbourne Grammar, he served in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">Commonwealth Cadet Corps</a>, reaching the rank of <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>.

In 1911, Herring entered <a href="Trinity%20College%20%28University%20of%20Melbourne%29">Trinity College</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> residential college at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, where he played cricket and tennis. In 1912, he won a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to the University of Oxford in England. There, he joined the <a href="Officers%20Training%20Corps">Officers Training Corps</a> in 1913. In November of that year he enlisted as a trooper in <a href="King%20Edward%27s%20Horse">King Edward's Horse</a>, a cavalry unit in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>.

King Edward's Horse was mobilised in August 1914, but was not immediately sent overseas. In December 1914, Herring was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a>, and was posted to B Battery, 99th Field Artillery Brigade of the <a href="22nd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 22nd Division</a>. The division moved to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in August 1915, but was there only a month before being transferred to the <a href="Macedonian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Macedonian front</a>, where it served for the rest of the war.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Battle of Doiran</a> in April 1917, Herring served as an <a href="artillery%20observer">artillery observer</a>, directing artillery fire in support of the 22nd Division's attack from a front line <a href="observation%20post">observation post</a> on Pip Ridge. There was a furious artillery duel. Twenty minutes after Captain Thomas Winwood took Herring's place as forward observer, the observation post took a direct hit from an enemy shell, killing Winwood. Herring succeeded Winwood as battery captain, and was promoted to acting <a href="Captain%20%28army/air%20force%29">captain</a> in April 1917. For his "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty" under heavy shellfire, Herring received an immediate award of the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>.

After three years' service, Herring was granted three weeks' leave in Australia in October 1917. He returned to Maryborough, where he met <a href="Mary%20Herring">Mary Ranken Lyle</a>, the daughter of the mathematical physicist <a href="Thomas%20Ranken%20Lyle">Thomas Lyle</a>, then a medical student at the University of Melbourne, on New Year's Day 1918. The two became constant companions and agreed to correspond regularly.

Herring departed for Salonika in February, returning to duty there in March 1918, and was promoted to acting <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a> on 24 October 1918 on assuming command of B Battery, 99th Field Artillery Brigade. For his service as a <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> commander, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. He reverted to lieutenant on ceasing to command the battery on 22 January 1919.

When the war ended, Herring wished to return to Australia and see Mary before resuming his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Civil%20Law">Bachelor of Civil Law</a> (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">MA</a> as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.

Herring was admitted to practice in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> and solicitor on 1 March 1921 and signed the roll of counsel of the Victorian Bar on 8 June of that year, while Mary graduated with her <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Surgery">Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery</a> (MB BS) and became a <a href="Residency%20%28medicine%29">resident</a> surgeon at <a href="Royal%20Melbourne%20Hospital">Royal Melbourne Hospital</a>. The two were married on 6 April 1922, and had three daughters, Mary Cecile (Molly), born in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy), born in 1926, and Margaret Lyle, born in 1933. Herring worked as a barrister, and lectured in law at the University of Melbourne. He became a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> on 25 February 1936. Mary worked as a physician at antenatal clinics.

Herring joined the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> on 1 October 1922 as a legal staff officer in the part-time <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a>, with the rank of captain. On 1 August 1923 he transferred to <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Australian%20Artillery">Australian Field Artillery</a>. He was promoted to major on 1 July 1925, <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 1 July 1929, and temporary <a href="colonel">colonel</a> on 1 August 1939, commanding the <a href="Australian%203rd%20Division">3rd Division</a> Artillery.

Herring was involved in politics throughout the 1930s. He was elected to the <a href="Melbourne%20Club">Melbourne Club</a> in 1927, a year before Sir Thomas Lyle became its president. He joined the <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Young Nationalists</a>, an organisation founded by <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> and <a href="Wilfrid%20Kent%20Hughes">Wilfrid Kent Hughes</a>. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was also a member of the clandestine far-right wing paramilitary organisation known as the White Guard, White Army or League of National Security. Composed primarily of former soldiers, the White Guard saw themselves as defenders of order who stood ready to stop a Catholic or Communist revolution in the wake of an emergency like the <a href="1923%20Victorian%20Police%20strike">1923 Victorian Police strike</a>. After failing to gain <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a> preselection for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of <a href="Prahran%2C%20Victoria">Prahran</a> in 1931, he ran as an unendorsed candidate (i.e. one lacking formal <a href="political%20endorsement">political endorsement</a>) for the seat of <a href="Brighton%2C%20Victoria">Brighton</a> in 1936. He gained 12,258 votes, losing by just 528. Herring also joined the Christian service organisation <a href="Toc%20H">Toc H</a> in 1925 and became its Victorian Area Commissioner in 1936.

On 6 October 1939, Herring was informed that <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a> had decided to appoint him as Commander, Royal Artillery, of the <a href="Australian%206th%20Division">6th Division</a>, of the new <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) being raised for service overseas. A week later, Herring was promoted to substantive colonel and temporary <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a>, and given the AIF serial number VX15. His first task was to organise his new command, which was equipped with World War I vintage <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2018%20pounder">18 pounder</a> guns and <a href="QF%204.5%20inch%20Howitzer">4.5 inch howitzers</a>. Herring left for <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> on 15 April 1940, along with the 6th Division's commander, Major General <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Iven Mackay</a> and his headquarters. Training was difficult as the old ammunition was in short supply. His command was only partially reequipped with the new <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025%20pounder">25 pounders</a> before being committed to the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> in December 1940.

At the <a href="Operation%20Compass">Battle of Bardia</a>, Herring controlled all 120 guns used in the division's attack, in which the infantry were supported by Great-War-style barrages. After the victory at Bardia, Herring's gunners supported the attack on <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. More than half of his guns were British, and some were commanded by regular British officers who were sceptical of the ability of an Australian Militia officer. War Correspondent <a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Chester Wilmot</a> noted that:

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">campaign in Greece</a>, Herring had, in addition to his own gunners, the 2nd Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a>, 64th Medium Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> and, for a time, the 6th Field Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Artillery">Royal New Zealand Artillery</a>, under his command. His Australian, New Zealand and British gunners demonstrated "the extent to which, in such rugged country, artillery, with reliable infantry ahead, could halt and confuse a pursuer" but they were unable to stop the enemy advance.

Herring was ordered to evacuate from Greece. He was one of between 7,000 and 8,000 troops that gathered at <a href="Nafplion">Nafplion</a> on 24 April 1941, although transportation had been arranged for only 5,000. The ship that he was to sail on, the "Ulster Prince" ran aground near the harbour entrance. She was refloated but then ran aground again near the wharf. Despite this, some 6,600 men and women were embarked. Herring and fellow Brigadier <a href="Clive%20Steele">Clive Steele</a> were among 5,100 that managed to reach <a href="Crete">Crete</a> on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> transport . From there they flew back to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Others were transported by , , and , which carried 150 Australian and New Zealand nurses. For his service in Libya and Greece, Herring was made a Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE).

Herring was promoted to the temporary rank of major general on 14 August 1941 when he took over command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a> and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a> with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a> appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.

In Blamey's reorganisation of the Army in April 1942, Herring was given command of <a href="Northern%20Territory%20Force">Northern Territory Force</a>. At this time <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> was being subjected to Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was impractical, Herring developed a land line of communications running across the <a href="outback">outback</a> from <a href="Alice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Alice Springs</a>.

On 14 August 1942, Herring was ordered to <a href="Esk%2C%20Queensland">Esk, Queensland</a>, to assume command of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> with the temporary rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">lieutenant general</a>. As such, he was responsible for the defence of <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. At this time he was criticised in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a> by <a href="Arthur%20Calwell">Arthur Calwell</a> for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an <a href="Intermediate%20Certificate%20%28Australia%29">Intermediate Certificate</a>. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an <a href="elitist">elitist</a>.

In the wake of the dismissal of Lieutenant General <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a> for insubordination, Blamey ordered Herring to join him in <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> as the new commander of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>. Before departing, Herring met with General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, who emphasised that the first duty of a soldier was obedience to his superiors.
As at Darwin, Herring's primary difficulty was <a href="logistics">logistics</a>. The troops on the <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a> had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by <a href="Papuan%20peoples">Papuan</a> native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Dwight%20Johns">Dwight Johns</a>, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips in order to develop the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.

More controversial was Herring's relief of Brigadier <a href="Arnold%20Potts">Arnold Potts</a> and Blamey's of Major General <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur Samuel Allen</a> at Herring's urging. Herring acknowledged that the two men had faced a difficult task but felt that they were tired and that Brigadier <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a> and Major General Vasey could do better. Supporters of Allen, who left school at age 14, saw this as the action of an autocratic elitist who "ran his staff as he had controlled junior counsel in his barrister's chamber; they did his bidding, his way, or were forthwith dispensed with".

In a letter to Herring in 1959, General <a href="Robert%20L.%20Eichelberger">Robert L. Eichelberger</a> (who had himself relieved two division commanders – Major Generals <a href="Edwin%20F.%20Harding">Edwin F. Harding</a> and <a href="Horace%20H.%20Fuller">Horace H. Fuller</a>) had this to say about the matter:

In November, Herring flew across the mountains to take control of the fighting around <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna-Gona">Buna</a>, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass enough troops, equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.

Following the victory at Buna, for which Herring and Eichelberger were appointed Knights Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a>, Blamey ordered him to return to Australia for a rest. While in Melbourne, Herring had an attack of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May. Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>, the capture of <a href="Lae">Lae</a>. Herring would command I Corps, which would be part of <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a> command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on <a href="Madang">Madang</a>.

At this time operations were in train to drive the Japanese back to <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>. Once again, the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable. Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities of the Americans, Herring left the command arrangements between Major General <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>'s <a href="Australian%203rd%20Division%20%28World%20War%20II%29">3rd Division</a> and units of the American <a href="41st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">41st Infantry Division</a> ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General <a href="Frank%20Horton%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a> determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.
The new offensive, which opened on 5 September 1943 with the <a href="Australian%207th%20Division">7th Division</a> <a href="landing%20at%20Nadzab">landing at Nadzab</a> by air and <a href="Australian%209th%20Division">9th Division</a> <a href="landing%20at%20Lae">landing at Lae</a> from the ships of Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a>'s <a href="VII%20Amphibious%20Force">VII Amphibious Force</a>, saw the rapid capture of Lae. While the 7th Division moved up the <a href="Ramu%20Valley%20campaign">Markham and Ramu Valleys</a>, the 9th Division made another landing at <a href="Battle%20of%20Scarlet%20Beach">Scarlet Beach</a> near <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>. The timing of the landing was contentious, with Barbey, who feared air attack, wanting to land at night while Herring held out for a dawn landing, threatening to take the issue to General MacArthur. Eventually Berryman managed to persuade Herring to accept a compromise H-hour in the darkness before dawn. The U.S. Naval Historian <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a> noted: "The Australians proved to be right; 'Uncle Dan's' outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing. The usual SNAFU developed." But Berryman saw Herring as being uncooperative, and his intransigence as a sign of battle weariness.

In the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Finschhafen">Battle of Finschhafen</a>, it soon became clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a>, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Arthur%20S.%20Carpender">Arthur S. Carpender</a>, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.

Carpender was not inflexible, and reached a compromise with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in <a href="high%20speed%20transport">high speed transports (APDs)</a>. Herring was in <a href="Dobodura">Dobodura</a>, lunching with <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Brehon%20B.%20Somervell">Brehon B. Somervell</a>, when he heard this news. He decided to fly to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> to discuss the matter of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the <a href="Marston%20mats">Marston Mat</a> runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.

Mackay became convinced that Herring was becoming increasingly difficult to work with as a result of stress and fatigue and asked Blamey for permission to relieve him. Blamey's response was characteristic: Morshead would be on the next plane. Yet Blamey maintained his faith in Herring, who retained command of I Corps on the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a>, where he trained his men for the next operation. He did not know when or where this would be, so he focused on <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a>. He created the <a href="1st%20Beach%20Group">1st Beach Group</a> and developed tactics and doctrine for amphibious operations based on his own experience in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea Campaign</a> and reports from the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. The benefits of his work would be realised in the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo Campaign</a>.

On 2 February 1944, the Victorian government decided to appoint Herring as <a href="Chief%20Justice">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a>. Blamey advised the Prime Minister that:

It was not quite the end of his military service. Herring was recalled to duty for a year as Director General of Recruiting in August 1950 when the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> spurred efforts to build up the Army again. In January 1953, Herring was selected as leader of the Australian Services Contingent for the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation</a> of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>. This saw Australian soldiers as the <a href="Queen%27s%20Guard">Queen's Guard</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 26 May 1953, with Herring personally taking part in the procession. On 10 July, he was made a Knight of the <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Order of St John</a> at Buckingham Palace. At the same time, Mary was made a commander of the same order for her charity work.

Herring maintained connections with his comrades from both World Wars. On the way back from the coronation, the Herrings stayed with the Eichelbergers in <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville, North Carolina</a>. The two generals remained close friends, exchanging regular letters until Eichelberger's death in 1961. In 1962, Herring visited <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a> at his home in <a href="Ross%2C%20Scotland">Ross</a>. In 1967 and 1971, the Herrings again travelled to America where they were guests of Dwight Johns and his wife. In 1973, he visited Washington, D.C. for the annual reunion of MacArthur's staff, and resolved that the next reunion should be held in Australia. He obtained government backing for his idea, and arranged for more than twenty former American generals, including <a href="Leif%20J.%20Sverdrup">Leif J. Sverdrup</a>, <a href="Hugh%20John%20Casey">Hugh John Casey</a>, <a href="William%20C.%20Chase">William C. Chase</a> and <a href="Clyde%20D.%20Eddleman">Clyde D. Eddleman</a> and their wives, to visit Australia in 1974, with commemorative functions being held in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Herring steadfastly believed that MacArthur, like Blamey, was a great commander who was not fully appreciated in his own country.

Herring's twenty years as Chief Justice was a period of significant change and growth in the administration of the law. During his period of office the number of judges on the Court increased from six to fourteen, reflecting the growth in cases. Herring earned a reputation as a fine judge and able administrator. He set up the Chief Justice's Law Reform Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria's courts was abreast of the times, and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year. Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972, serving in the position for a record 27 years. For his service as Lieutenant Governor, Herring was made a Knight Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Order of St Michael and St George</a> in the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> of 9 June 1949.

In a speech given on the occasion of his retiring as Chief Justice of Victoria, Herring said:
While opening the Victorian <a href="Returned%20Services%20League">Returned Services League</a> Conference shortly before his retirement as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who had served in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. "People who throw stones at Americans," he said, "should stop and think where we would have been in 1942 without the Americans." Such remarks earned him a rebuke from the then acting State Opposition Leader, <a href="Frank%20Wilkes">Frank Wilkes</a>, as "untactful" for a representative of the Crown.

Herring again became the subject of controversy in May 1978 when <a href="Barry%20Jones%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Barry Jones</a> revealed in Federal Parliament that during the Second World War Herring had confirmed death sentences on 22 Papuans convicted of handing over seven Anglican missionaries to the Japanese, which Jones called "the darkest secret in modern Australian history". The Papuans had been convicted of offences including murder and treason. Herring claimed that they had been treated fairly under the conventions and circumstances applicable in wartime. "I have a clear conscience about it", he said. The seven missionaries had all been murdered by the Japanese. Four of them were women who had been raped as well. The Papuans had also handed over to the Japanese for execution two planters, six Australian soldiers, and two American airmen, and they had murdered Australian soldiers of the 39th Infantry Battalion near Kokoda. They were handed over to <a href="ANGAU">ANGAU</a>, which had carried out the executions at Higaturu in September 1943.

Herring was president of the <a href="The%20Scout%20Association">Boy Scouts' Association</a> of Victoria for 23 years, and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association from 1959 to 1977. He was chairman of trustees of the <a href="Shrine%20of%20Remembrance">Shrine of Remembrance</a> from 1945 to 1978 (and remained a trustee until his death) and chairman of trustees of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> from 1959 to 1974. He was made a fellow of <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, in 1949, received an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Civil%20Law">DCL</a> from Oxford in 1953, became an honorary bencher of the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a> in 1963 and received an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">LLD</a> from <a href="Monash%20University">Monash University</a> in 1973. He was also active in the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Church</a>, and for many years was <a href="Chancellor%20%28ecclesiastical%29">chancellor</a> of the <a href="diocese">diocese</a> of Melbourne, the highest church office that could be held by a layman. In 1980 he was elected one of the inaugural fellows of Trinity College, Melbourne, under its new constitution.

Herring died at a <a href="Camberwell%2C%20Victoria">Camberwell, Victoria</a>, nursing home on 5 January 1982. He was given a state funeral at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne">St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne</a>, planned by his wife, Dame Mary Ranken Herring, who had died three months before.

Victoria's <a href="Herring%20Island%20%28Victoria%29">Herring Island</a> is named after him; it is beside the <a href="Monash%20Freeway">Monash Freeway</a> (named for Herring's fellow "civilian soldier", general and lawyer, Sir <a href="John%20Monash">John Monash</a>) in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s <a href="Yarra%20River">Yarra River</a> at <a href="South%20Yarra">South Yarra</a>, approximately from the city. Herring's wartime portraits are in the Australian War Memorial in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, which featured him as one of the fifty most prominent Australians with a military background. His papers are in the <a href="State%20Library%20of%20Victoria">State Library of Victoria</a>.

Tank Girl (film)

Tank Girl is a 1995 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="Rachel%20Talalay">Rachel Talalay</a>. Based on the British <a href="post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> comic series of <a href="Tank%20Girl">the same name</a> by <a href="Alan%20Martin%20%28writer%29">Alan Martin</a> and <a href="Jamie%20Hewlett">Jamie Hewlett</a> that was originally published in "<a href="Deadline%20%28magazine%29">Deadline</a>" magazine, the film stars <a href="Lori%20Petty">Lori Petty</a>, <a href="Naomi%20Watts">Naomi Watts</a>, <a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>. "Tank Girl" is set in a drought-ravaged <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, years after a catastrophic <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a>. It follows the <a href="antihero">antihero</a> Tank Girl (Petty) as she, Jet Girl (Watts), and <a href="genetically%20modified%20organism">genetically modified</a> <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a>s called the Rippers fight "Water & Power", an oppressive corporation led by Kesslee (McDowell).

After reading an issue of the "Tank Girl" comic she had received as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from "Deadline"s publisher Tom Astor to direct a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a>. She selected <a href="Catherine%20Hardwicke">Catherine Hardwicke</a> to be the <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a>, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during the making of the film. "Tank Girl" was filmed primarily in <a href="White%20Sands%2C%20New%20Mexico">White Sands, New Mexico</a>, and <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by <a href="Courtney%20Love">Courtney Love</a>, and the Rippers' makeup and <a href="prosthetics">prosthetics</a> team was headed by <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a>. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget.

Financially unsuccessful, "Tank Girl" recouped only about $6 million of its $25 million budget at the box office and received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's negative reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the negative critical reception and box-office failure of the film, it has been cited as an example of a comic-book film with a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>, and it is noted for its <a href="feminist">feminist</a> themes.

In 2022, a comet strikes Earth, causing a drought that is still ongoing in 2033, the year in which the film is set. Most of the little remaining water is controlled by Kesslee (<a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>) and his Water & Power (W&P) corporation, which controls the population by monopolising the water supply. Rebecca Buck – "Tank Girl" (<a href="Lori%20Petty">Lori Petty</a>) – is a member of a commune in the Australian <a href="outback">outback</a> that operates the last <a href="water%20well">water well</a> not controlled by the corporation. In an attack on the commune, W&P troops kill Tank Girl's boyfriend, Richard (<a href="Brian%20Wimmer">Brian Wimmer</a>), and capture Tank Girl and her young friend Sam (Stacy Linn Ramsower). Rather than killing her, Kesslee enslaves and tortures the defiant Tank Girl. Jet Girl (<a href="Naomi%20Watts">Naomi Watts</a>), a talented but <a href="Extraversion%20and%20introversion">introverted</a> jet mechanic who has given up trying to escape W&P, urges Tank Girl to make less trouble for their captors, though Tank Girl refuses. Among other forms of torture, W&P personnel push her down into a long pipe to induce <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a>.

The mysterious Rippers slaughter guards at the W&P compound, then escape. Kesslee uses Tank Girl to lure the Rippers into the open, but they gravely wound him. Tank Girl and Jet Girl escape during the attack. Jet Girl steals a fighter jet from W&P and Tank Girl steals a tank, which she modifies heavily. The girls learn from the eccentric Sub Girl (<a href="Ann%20Cusack">Ann Cusack</a>) that Sam is working at a sex club called Liquid Silver. They infiltrate the club, rescue Sam from a <a href="Pedophilia">pedophile</a>, Rat Face (<a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>), and then humiliate the club's owner, "The Madame" (<a href="Ann%20Magnuson">Ann Magnuson</a>), by making her sing <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a>'s "<a href="Let%27s%20Do%20It%2C%20Let%27s%20Fall%20in%20Love">Let's Do It</a>" at gunpoint. W&P troops break up the performance and recapture Sam. Tank Girl and Jet Girl wander the desert and find the Rippers' hideout. They learn that the Rippers are <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a>s created from human and kangaroo <a href="DNA">DNA</a> by a man called Johnny Prophet. Tank Girl befriends a Ripper named Booga (<a href="Jeff%20Kober">Jeff Kober</a>), while a Ripper named Donner (<a href="Scott%20Coffey">Scott Coffey</a>) shows romantic interest in Jet Girl. Despite the objections of the Ripper T-Saint (<a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a>), who is suspicious of the girls, the Rippers' leader Deetee (<a href="Reg%20E.%20Cathey">Reg E. Cathey</a>) sends the pair out to capture a shipment of weapons. The girls bring the weapons crates back, though most of them are empty. After finding Johnny Prophet dead in one of the containers, the girls and the Rippers realize that W&P has tricked them.

The girls and the Rippers sneak into W&P, where they are ambushed. Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai (<a href="James%20Hong">James Hong</a>), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been <a href="Covert%20listening%20device">bugged</a>. Deetee sacrifices himself damaging the generator, and in the darkness the Rippers turn the tide of the battle. Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (<a href="Donald%20Patrick%20Harvey">Don Harvey</a>), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life endangered by rising water. Tank Girl kills Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.
Writing in the 1997 book "Trash Aesthetics: Popular Culture and Its Audience", Deborah Cartmell states that while the comic showed Tank Girl to be "unheroic or even [an] accidental <a href="antihero">antihero</a>", the film sets her up with "classic western generic" emotional and moral justifications for her liberation and revenge on W&P, as she witnesses the slaughter of her boyfriend and her "trusty steed". She also sees one of the commune's children being abducted, and is herself captured and enslaved. Cartmell also says Tank Girl holds parallels with other "contemporary '<a href="Postfeminism">postfeminist</a>' icons", as she displays dominant female sexuality and a "familiarity and knowing coolness of 'outlawed' modes of sexuality", such as <a href="masturbation">masturbation</a>, <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>, and lesbianism.

In her 2006 book "The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen", <a href="Dominique%20Mainon">Dominique Mainon</a> writes that the film has anti<a href="The%20Establishment">establishment</a> themes and, unlike many comic-book adaptation films which feature "gratuitous sexual objectification" of women, "Tank Girl" stands out as being "stridently feminist", with the exception of the "cliché victim/avenger complex". According to Mainon, the film makes fun of female stereotypes, as shown by Tank Girl's repeated emasculation of Kesslee with witty comebacks while she is being tortured, and by her response to the computer training device telling her how to present herself to men at the Liquid Silver club. The device provides seductive clothing and tells Tank Girl to remove her body hair and to wear make-up and a wig. Tank Girl completely ignores the advice and modifies the clothes to create her own style.

In the 2011 book "Cult Cinema", Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton discuss the issue of whether cult films purported to be feminist were truly feminist or "partly the effect of the performance of feminist attitudes in its reception". The authors consider "Tank Girl" to be a "'real' feminist cult film", as opposed to the feminist cult films of <a href="Kathryn%20Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a> and <a href="Catherine%20Hardwicke">Catherine Hardwicke</a>, which they consider to be too masculine and too eager to cater to "hetero-normativity", respectively.

In 1988, about a year after the launch of the "Tank Girl" comic in the British magazine "Deadline", its publisher, Tom Astor, began looking for a studio interested in making a film adaptation. While several studios, including <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a>, expressed interest, progress was slow. Rachel Talalay's stepdaughter gave her a "Tank Girl" comic to read while she was shooting her directorial debut film, "" (released in 1991). Talalay read the comic between takes and became interested in directing a "Tank Girl" film. She contacted Astor and, after hearing nothing for almost a year, was about to give up trying to secure the rights when he gave her permission to make the film. Talalay pitched the film to <a href="Amblin%20Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, which both turned it down. Talalay turned down an offer from <a href="Disney">Disney</a>, as she did not believe the studio would allow the levels of violence and the sexual references the plot required. An offer from <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> was accepted. Talalay worked closely with the "Tank Girl" comic's co-creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett during the film's production, and selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer. The studio was unhappy with Hardwicke, who was relatively unknown at the time, being chosen over more experienced designers, and Talalay had to meet with the producers to persuade them to allow Hardwicke to work on the project. <a href="Tedi%20Sarafian">Tedi Sarafian</a> wrote the screenplay, which marked his debut production credit, and <a href="Gale%20Tattersall">Gale Tattersall</a> was chosen as <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>. Believing that MGM would not allow the depiction of a <a href="Bestiality">bestial</a> relationship in the film, the romance between Tank Girl and Booga was only written into the second or third version of the script, after the character was already established in the minds of people involved in the production. By this stage, Booga: "was a character and not just a kangaroo [so] it wasn't an issue anymore."

MGM held open casting sessions in London, Los Angeles, and New York for the role of Tank Girl. According to Talalay, some were skeptical of the open casting, thinking that it was a publicity stunt. This was true to an extent, as she had been asking the studio to cast a well-known English actress, <a href="Emily%20Lloyd">Emily Lloyd</a>. Talalay says she fired Lloyd after she refused to cut her hair for the role. Lloyd, who had spent four months training for the role, disputes this, saying she simply rescheduled her appointment with the film's hair stylist to the following day, after which Talalay fired her for "being difficult". Talalay cast Lori Petty, an American, because "she is crazy in her own life and [the film] needed somebody like that." MGM faxed "Deadline" asking them for an "ideal cast" list; they selected Malcolm McDowell for Kesslee, but never believed MGM would actually contact him. McDowell has spoken favorably of his experience working on the film, saying it had the "same flavour" as "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28film%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>", and praised Talalay and Petty. Talalay was approached by several people who wanted <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameos</a> in the film, but she did not want the film to be overshadowed by such appearances. Two cameos were settled on – Iggy Pop was given the role of Rat Face, and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a> was offered Sub Girl. She later dropped out, her character's scenes were rewritten, and the role was then given to Ann Cusack.

"Tank Girl" was filmed over 16 weeks, in three locations; desert scenes were filmed in White Sands, New Mexico, the Liquid Silver club set was built at an abandoned shopping mall in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, and all remaining scenes were filmed within 40 miles of Tucson, Arizona. Many scenes were filmed in an abandoned <a href="Open-pit%20mining">open-pit mine</a>, where filming had to be halted one day due to a chemical leak. Permission was received to film the water pipe scenes at the <a href="Titan%20Missile%20Museum">Titan Missile Museum</a>, near the mine, but the day before shooting, permission was withdrawn. These scenes were filmed, instead, in a tunnel at the abandoned mine. New sets were often found by simply searching the mine. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> was completed on September27, 1994, two days over schedule, though still within the original budget.

In the comics, the Rippers are considerably more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the Rippers to make them more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions. Requests were sent out to "all the major make-up and effects people", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included <a href="Terminator%20%28franchise%29">the "Terminator" films</a>, "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>", and "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>". Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be the best, she did not expect to hear back from him. When she did, she still did not think that she would be able to afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the Rippers would be: "the best characters we've had the opportunity to do." Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Eight Rippers featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background Rippers also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths. Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the Rippers.

The tank used in the film is a modified <a href="M3%20Stuart%23Variants">M5A1 Stuart</a>. It was purchased from the government of Peru about 12 years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for "Tank Girl", the tank's 37 mm antitank gun was covered with a modified flag pole to give the appearance of a 105 mm gun. An entire 1969 <a href="Cadillac%20Eldorado">Cadillac Eldorado</a> was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the <a href="Fender%20%28vehicle%29">fender</a> welded to the front.

A "naked Ripper suit" incorporating a prosthetic penis was created for Booga and used in a filmed post<a href="Sexual%20intercourse">coital</a> scene which was removed from the final version of the film at the studio's insistence. Deborah Cartmell described the "postcoital scene" in the final version, which featured Booga fully clothed, as "carefully edited". Against Talalay's wishes, the studio made several other edits to the film. The scene in which Kesslee tortures Tank Girl was cut heavily on the grounds that she appeared "too ugly" while being tortured. Also cut was a scene showing Tank Girl's bedroom, which was shown to be decorated with dozens of <a href="dildo">dildo</a>s, and a scene in which she places a condom on a banana before throwing it at a soldier. The studio cut the original ending scene, a live-action scene in which it begins to rain; the film was to have ended with Tank Girl burping.

The film's soundtrack was assembled by <a href="Courtney%20Love">Courtney Love</a>; <a href="Graeme%20Revell">Graeme Revell</a> composed the original music. Love's band <a href="Hole%20%28band%29">Hole</a> contributed the song "Drown Soda". <a href="Greg%20Graffin">Greg Graffin</a> from <a href="Bad%20Religion">Bad Religion</a> was originally supposed to sing the duet of "Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love" with <a href="Joan%20Jett">Joan Jett</a>, but due to contractual restrictions he was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Westerberg">Paul Westerberg</a> from <a href="The%20Replacements%20%28band%29">The Replacements</a>. <a href="Devo">Devo</a> recorded a new version of their song "<a href="Girl%20U%20Want">Girl U Want</a>" specifically for the film, as they were big fans of the comic. "Girl U Want" plays in the film's opening sequence, featuring the singing of Jula Bell from <a href="Bulimia%20Banquet">Bulimia Banquet</a>; this version with Bell is in the film but not on the soundtrack album. The soundtrack featured Björk's song <a href="Army%20of%20Me%20%28Bj%C3%B6rk%20song%29">"Army of Me"</a> before it was released as a single. Because of the box-office failure of the film, both Björk and <a href="Elektra%20Records">her label</a> decided not to use footage from the film in the song's accompanying music video.

The song "Mockingbird Girl" by The Magnificent Bastards (a <a href="side%20project">side project</a> of <a href="Scott%20Weiland">Scott Weiland</a>) was recorded specifically for the album after Love approached Weiland asking if he would like to contribute a song. The single's cover showed the torso and thighs of an animated character resembling Tank Girl and featured the tracks "Ripper Sole" and "Girl U Want" from the album. In the United States it peaked at No.27 on the <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock</a> chart and No.12 on the <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart. The song "2¢" by <a href="Beow%C3%BClf">Beowülf</a> also appears in the film; Talalay lobbied <a href="Restless%20Records">Restless Records</a> to have the song included on the soundtrack but was unsuccessful. Instead, she directed the music video for the song, which featured both animated and live-action footage from the film.

The soundtrack album was released on March28, 1995, by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> and <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>. It peaked at number72 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The next week, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine wrote that the soundtrack was getting more attention than the film itself. However, Ron Hancock of <a href="Tower%20Records">Tower Records</a> stated that sales of the album were disappointing and attributed this to the financial failure of the film. Owen Gleiberman spoke favorably of the soundtrack, as did Laura Barcella writing in the book "The End", describing it as a "who's who of '90s female rock." <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of "<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>" said the album was "much better than the film", awarding it three out of five stars.


"Tank Girl" premiered at the <a href="TCL%20Chinese%20Theatre">Mann Chinese Theatre</a> on March30, 1995. Approximately 1,500 people attended the screening, including Talalay, Petty, , McDowell, Watts, and several other actors from the film, as well as <a href="Rebecca%20De%20Mornay">Rebecca De Mornay</a>, <a href="Lauren%20Tom">Lauren Tom</a>, <a href="Brendan%20Fraser">Brendan Fraser</a> and <a href="Jason%20Simmons">Jason Simmons</a>. Men in W&P costumes handed out bottles of mineral water, and girls dressed in Liquid Silver outfits gave out <a href="Astro%20Pops">Astro Pops</a>, candy cigarettes, and "Tank Girl" candy necklaces. About 400 people attended the official after-party at the <a href="Hollywood%20Roosevelt%20Hotel">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a>. The film opened in cinemas across the United States the following day.

"Tank Girl" opened in 1,341 theatres in the United States bringing in $2,018,183 in its first weekend and $2,684,430 at the end of its first week of release. By the end of its second week, "Tank Girl" had made only $3,668,762. Its final gross in the United States was $4,064,495. Internationally, the film added approximately $2,000,000 to that total, against a production budget of $25 million.

The website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative, surveyed 39 critics and determined that 38% of the reviews were positive with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "While unconventional, "Tank Girl" isn't particularly clever or engaging, and none of the script's copious one-liners have any real zing." Lamar Hafildason of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> gave the film one out of five stars, saying: "Sadly, the BBC does not pay out for one-word reviews. If it did, then this review would read simply: 'tiresome'." In 2001, Matt Brunson from <a href="Creative%20Loafing">Creative Loafing</a> gave the film one and a half stars out of four concluding: "a rockin' soundtrack ... and a peek at Watts early in her career are the only ingredients saving this from a bomb rating." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film two out of four stars. While praising the film's ambition and energy, he said he could not "care about it for much more than a moment at a time, and after a while its manic energy wore [him] down."

<a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> gave the film a C– rating, praising Petty's performance which he said was the only good part of an otherwise "amateurish" film. <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> and <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> gave moderately positive reviews, with Rosenbaum concluding: "unless you're a preteen boy who hates girls, it's funnier and a lot more fun than "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>"." Maslin wrote: "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a <a href="Fluoxetine">Prozac</a> necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy." Leonard Klady from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" gave a mixed review, saying: "What's missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits. And Lori Petty as 'Tank Girl' ... has the spunk but, sadly, not the heart of the post-apocalyptic heroine."

"Tank Girl" was released on DVD by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> on April10, 2001. Aaron Beierle from <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> gave the DVD three and a half stars out of five for both video and audio quality, though only half a star for special features, noting that only the original trailer was included.

<a href="Shout%21%20Factory">Shout! Factory</a> acquired the rights to several MGM films, including "Tank Girl", and subsequently released a US <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> version on November19, 2013. Special features included the original trailer, a 'Making of' featurette, a <a href="Audio%20commentary">commentary track</a> with Petty and Talalay, and interviews with Talalay, Petty, and Hardwicke. Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com gave the version four stars out of five for audio and video quality and three stars for special features. M. Enois Duarte from highdefdigest.com gave the version three and a half stars out of five for video quality, four stars for audio quality, and two and a half stars for extras. The blu-ray has not been released internationally.

To boost its declining readership, "Deadline" featured Tank Girl on its cover many times in 1994 and 1995 in anticipation of the film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it "a bit of a sore point" for them. "The script was lousy," Hewlett recalled, "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting "<a href="Grange%20Hill">Grange Hill</a>" jokes and <a href="Benny%20Hill">Benny Hill</a> jokes in, and they obviously weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them ... it was a horrible experience." Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been "in sync" and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. <a href="Peter%20Milligan">Peter Milligan</a> wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by <a href="Martin%20Millar%20%28writer%29">Martin Millar</a> was published in 1996. In 2008, Talalay was negotiating with Sony to obtain the rights to direct a Tank Girl <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot film</a>. Obtaining the rights was said to be a difficult process, due to legal issues of propriety related to the acquisition of MGM and United Artists by Sony and other companies.

Despite being a critical and commercial failure, "Tank Girl" is often said to have a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>. Petty's version of Tank Girl remains a popular character at <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> events. The music video for <a href="Avril%20Lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>'s 2013 song "<a href="Rock%20n%20Roll%20%28Avril%20Lavigne%20song%29">Rock n Roll</a>" was heavily influenced by "Tank Girl". During her interview included on the Blu-ray release of the film in 2013, Petty was asked why she thinks the film still resonates with fans, and replied: "There's no formula as to why "Tank Girl" was so fabulous and why people love it so much ... It was unique, it was new, it was fresh, it was way ahead of its time, and I'm happy that I got to do it and that I'll always have her." Luke Buckmaster from the BBC included the film in his 2015 list of the "ten weirdest superhero films", asserting that: "at its best, director Rachel Talalay captures an ostentatious steampunk vibe that proves weirdly addictive."

Act of Independence of Lithuania

The Act of Reinstating Independence of Lithuania () or Act of 16 February was signed by the <a href="Council%20of%20Lithuania">Council of Lithuania</a> on 16 February 1918, proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, governed by <a href="democracy">democratic</a> principles, with <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> as its capital. The Act was signed by all <a href="Signatories%20of%20the%20Act%20of%20Independence%20of%20Lithuania">twenty representatives</a> of the Council, which was chaired by <a href="Jonas%20Basanavi%C4%8Dius">Jonas Basanavičius</a>. The Act of 16 February was the result of a series of resolutions on the issue, including one issued by the <a href="Vilnius%20Conference">Vilnius Conference</a> and the Act of 8 January. The path to the Act was long and complex because the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> exerted pressure on the Council to form an alliance. The Council had to carefully maneuver between the Germans, whose troops were present in Lithuania, and the demands of the Lithuanian people.

The immediate effects of the announcement of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered, and Germans remained in control over Lithuania. The situation changed only when Germany lost <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in the fall of 1918. In November 1918 the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed, and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania. Independent Lithuania, although it would soon be battling the <a href="Lithuanian%20Wars%20of%20Independence">Wars of Independence</a>, became a reality.

The laconic Act is the legal basis for the existence of modern Lithuania, both during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a> and since 1990. The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all <a href="Constitution%20of%20Lithuania">Constitutions of Lithuania</a>. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's <a href="Act%20of%20the%20Re-Establishment%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Lithuania">re-establishment of independence in 1990</a>. Lithuania, breaking away from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.

On 29 March 2017, the original document was found at the Diplomatic archive in Berlin, Germany.

Lithuania had a centuries long tradition of statehood following the coronation of <a href="Mindaugas">Mindaugas</a> the <a href="King%20of%20Lithuania">King of Lithuania</a>.
After the last <a href="partitions%20of%20Poland">Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. During the 19th century, both the Lithuanians and the <a href="Poland">Poles</a> attempted to restore their independence. Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 <a href="November%20Uprising">November Uprising</a> and the 1863 <a href="January%20Uprising">January Uprising</a>, but their first real opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

In 1915, Germany occupied western parts of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. After the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution</a> in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of <a href="Mitteleuropa">Mitteleuropa</a> – a regional network of <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a>s that would serve as a buffer zone – and agreed to allow the <a href="Vilnius%20Conference">Vilnius Conference</a>, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany. However, this strategy backfired; the conference, held on 18–22 September 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany's formal recognition of the new state. On 21 September, the 214 attendees at the conference elected a 20-member <a href="Council%20of%20Lithuania">Council of Lithuania</a> to codify this resolution. The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published, but they did permit the Council to proceed. The Vilnius Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected "in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania".

The Act of 11 December was the second stage in the progression towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor <a href="Georg%20von%20Hertling">Georg von Hertling</a>, was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1. Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were <a href="Antanas%20Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a>, <a href="Steponas%20Kairys">Steponas Kairys</a>, <a href="Vladas%20Mironas">Vladas Mironas</a>, <a href="Jurgis%20%C5%A0aulys">Jurgis Šaulys</a>, <a href="Petras%20Klimas">Petras Klimas</a> and <a href="Aleksandras%20Stulginskis">Aleksandras Stulginskis</a>. After discussion amongst the parties, a compromise was reached on the document's text. The German representative, Kurt von Lersner, insisted that not one word be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.

After the delegation returned to Vilnius, a session of the Council was held on 11 December in order to discuss the Act. It was adopted without any further changes. Fifteen voted in favor of the Act, three voted against it, one member abstained, and one did not participate. It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document. The Act was written in <a href="German%20language">German</a>, and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared. Therefore, different sources provide slightly different translations. The Act of 11 December pronounced Lithuania's independence, but also asked German government for protection (clause 2) and called for "a firm and permanent alliance" with Germany. Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, customs, and currency, many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority: the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state.

When peace talks started between Germany and Russia in 1918, German authorities asked the <a href="Lithuanians">Lithuanian</a> representatives to prepare two notifications of independence—one for Russia, in which Lithuania's ties with Russia would be denounced and nothing would be mentioned about an alliance with Germany, and a version to be released in Germany that would essentially repeat the Act of 11 December. The Council decided to amend the first part of the Act of 11 December. <a href="Petras%20Klimas">Petras Klimas</a> included a sentence calling for the Constituent Assembly. Another important development was the statement that democratic principles would be the basis of the new state's governance, something that was declared by the Vilnius Conference, but omitted in the Act of 11 December. The second part, mentioning the "firm and permanent alliance with Germany", was completely omitted. Its final version was approved on 8 January 1918, the day that <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> announced his <a href="Fourteen%20Points">Fourteen Points</a>. In its essence, the Act of 8 January did not differ from the Act of 16 February.

However, <a href="Ober%20Ost">Ober Ost</a>, the German military administration, rejected the changes. On 26 January, in compliance with the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of 8 January. The texts were prepared based on the Act of 11 December. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – <a href="Mykolas%20Bir%C5%BEi%C5%A1ka">Mykolas Biržiška</a>, <a href="Steponas%20Kairys">Steponas Kairys</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Narutowicz">Stanisław Narutowicz</a> and <a href="Jonas%20Vilei%C5%A1is">Jonas Vileišis</a> – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman <a href="Antanas%20Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a>, who supported the Act of 11 December, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.

Germany failed to recognize Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk negotiations</a> that started on 22 December 1917, between the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> and <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Russia</a> in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was made clear that the Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.

The four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of 8 January and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany. After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on 15 February, at 10 am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of 8 January and <a href="promulgation">promulgation</a> and notification, drafted on 1 February. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document. The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, 16 February 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 <a href="Did%C5%BEioji%20Street">Didžioji Street</a> in Vilnius. The building has since been known as the <a href="House%20of%20the%20Signatories">House of the Signatories</a> () and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word "drauge", of the Act. This section was approved unanimously. The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word ""finally"" in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in ""... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ...""). They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions. Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3Aen%20bloc">en bloc</a>" but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.

"Note: the colors of the functional sections correspond to the colored lines in the original text above."

Soon after the signing, the Act was taken to Germany and handed to parties in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a>. On 18 February, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, including "<a href="Das%20Neue%20Litauen">Das Neue Litauen</a>", "<a href="Vossische%20Zeitung">Vossische Zeitung</a>", "<a href="Taegliche%20Rundschau">Taegliche Rundschau</a>" and "<a href="Kreuzzeitung">Kreuzzeitung</a>". In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in "<a href="Lietuvos%20aidas">Lietuvos aidas</a>", the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. Although the majority of the copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, <a href="Petras%20Klimas">Petras Klimas</a>, managed to hide about 60 of them.

On 3 March 1918, Germany and the now-<a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Russia</a> signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>. It declared that the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic nations</a> were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On 23 March, Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the 11 December declaration. However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered. This situation changed when the <a href="German%20Revolution">German Revolution</a> started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on 2 November. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and <a href="Augustinas%20Voldemaras">Augustinas Voldemaras</a> was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on 22 July 1922.

Two copies of the Act were signed: the original and a duplicate. The original was given to Jonas Basanavičius to safeguard and protect. The original was never published or used in any public matters; its existence was first mentioned in the press in 1933. The duplicate was used in day-to-day business, and was stored in the president's archives until 15 June 1940, the day when Lithuania <a href="1940%20Soviet%20ultimatum%20to%20Lithuania">received an ultimatum from the Soviet Union</a> and lost its independence. After that date the document disappeared. Both the original and the duplicate were missing for decades; historians and adventurers hunted for them. In 2006, a team of engineers searched the walls of the <a href="Vilei%C5%A1is%20Palace">former house</a> of <a href="Petras%20Vilei%C5%A1is">Petras Vileišis</a>. Two <a href="facsimile">facsimile</a>s of the duplicate were produced, one in 1928 and the other in 1933. The 1928 facsimile is a closer reproduction of the Act in its original state. It contains spelling errors and the background is visually "noisy", while the 1933 facsimile shows the Act in an "improved" condition.

In 2017, Lithuanian businessman <a href="Darius%20Mockus">Darius Mockus</a> offered a 1-million-<a href="Euro">Euro</a> reward to anyone who could find the original document and give it to the State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence. On 29 March 2017, <a href="Vytautas%20Magnus%20University">Vytautas Magnus University</a> professor <a href="Liudas%20Ma%C5%BEylis">Liudas Mažylis</a> announced he had found the original document in the <a href="Federal%20Foreign%20Office">Federal Foreign Office Political Archive</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, hand-written in the <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian language</a> and signed by the twenty. He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 document and the Act of 11 December 1917. The latter displays nineteen signatures (without that of <a href="Pranas%20Dovydaitis">Pranas Dovydaitis</a>). Germany confirmed the documents' authenticity on the following day and they were displayed publicly by two officials — <a href="Michael%20Roth%20%28politician%29">Michael Roth</a>, the German <a href="Minister%20of%20State%23Germany">Minister of State for Europe</a>, and <a href="Deividas%20Matulionis">Deividas Matulionis</a>, Lithuania ambassador in Germany. On 5 October 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="Linas%20Antanas%20Linkevi%C4%8Dius">Linas Linkevičius</a> and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="Sigmar%20Gabriel">Sigmar Gabriel</a> signed an agreement that the original Act of Independence will be displayed for five years in the <a href="House%20of%20the%20Signatories">House of the Signatories</a> where it was originally signed, making it the main symbol of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State celebrations. On 22 December 2017, experts from the <a href="Law%20enforcement%20in%20Lithuania">Lithuanian Police</a> Forensic Research Center after a thorough analysis announced that the hand-written act was written by one of the signatories <a href="Jurgis%20%C5%A0aulys">Jurgis Šaulys</a> hand.

On 22 December 2017, yet another version of the Act of Independence of Lithuania was found by historian <a href="Darius%20Antanavi%C4%8Dius">Darius Antanavičius</a> in the <a href="Vatican%20Secret%20Archives">Vatican Secret Archives</a> that was sent to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. This version of the Act was printed in <a href="German%20language">German language</a> and signed by <a href="Antanas%20Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a>, <a href="Jonas%20Vilei%C5%A1is">Jonas Vileišis</a>, Jurgis Šaulys and <a href="Justinas%20Staugaitis">Justinas Staugaitis</a>.

Most of the signatories of the Act remained active in the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania. <a href="Jonas%20Vilei%C5%A1is">Jonas Vileišis</a> served in the <a href="Seimas">Seimas</a> and as <a href="mayor">mayor</a> of <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>, <a href="temporary%20capital%20of%20Lithuania">temporary capital of Lithuania</a>; <a href="Saliamonas%20Banaitis">Saliamonas Banaitis</a> was involved in finance, opening several banks. Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, <a href="Antanas%20Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a> and <a href="Aleksandras%20Stulginskis">Aleksandras Stulginskis</a>. <a href="Jonas%20Basanavi%C4%8Dius">Jonas Basanavičius</a>, chairman of the Council of Lithuania, returned to an academic life, pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore. Five signatories died before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> started; three died during the <a href="Nazi%20occupation%20of%20Lithuania">Nazi occupation</a>. Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.

<a href="Aleksandras%20Stulginskis">Aleksandras Stulginskis</a> and <a href="Petras%20Klimas">Petras Klimas</a> were sent to prison in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> by Soviet authorities, but survived and returned to Lithuania; <a href="Pranas%20Dovydaitis">Pranas Dovydaitis</a> and <a href="Vladas%20Mironas">Vladas Mironas</a> were also sent to Siberia but died there. <a href="Kazys%20Bizauskas">Kazys Bizauskas</a> disappeared during the summer of 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>; he is presumed to have been shot along with a number of other prisoners. <a href="Donatas%20Malinauskas">Donatas Malinauskas</a> was <a href="June%20deportation">deported to Russia</a> on 14 June 1941.

Several of the surviving signatories emigrated. <a href="Jurgis%20%C5%A0aulys">Jurgis Šaulys</a> and <a href="Kazimieras%20Steponas%20%C5%A0aulys">Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys</a> died in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. <a href="Antanas%20Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a>, <a href="Mykolas%20Bir%C5%BEi%C5%A1ka">Mykolas Biržiška</a>, and <a href="Steponas%20Kairys">Steponas Kairys</a> emigrated to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and are buried there.

The Act of 16 February proclaimed the "re"-establishment ("atstatyti") of the Lithuanian state, making it the successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment ("sudaryti") of a Lithuanian state. However, it was made clear that the new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the <a href="Vilnius%20region">Vilnius region</a> which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian union</a>.

The Act of 16 February 1918, is the legal basis for the existence of present-day Lithuania, both during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a> and since 1990. The Act became one of the key elements during the restoration of Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. A paragraph in the <a href="Act%20of%20the%20Re-Establishment%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Lithuania">Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania</a>, delivered on 11 March 1990, stated:
This formulation emphasized the continuity of the two legal Acts. The Act of 16 February 1918, and its successor, the Act of 11 March 1990, are regarded as two of the most important developments of Lithuanian society in the 20th century.

16 February in Lithuania is an official holiday. On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania. The 2014 commemoration included laying flowers at the signatories’ graves in <a href="Rasos%20Cemetery">Rasos Cemetery</a>, awarding the <a href="Lithuanian%20National%20Prize">Lithuanian National Prize</a>, the hoisting of the three <a href="Baltic%20States">Baltic States</a>’s flags at <a href="Daukantas%20Square">Daukantas Square</a>, dedicated concerts at <a href="Cathedral%20Square%2C%20Vilnius">Cathedral Square in Vilnius</a> and at the <a href="Lithuanian%20National%20Philharmonic%20Society">Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society</a> hall, and the lighting of 16 fires along <a href="Gediminas%20Avenue">Gediminas Avenue</a>.

In 1992, an award was established in honor of Jonas Basanavičius, who led the Council of Lithuania when the Act of 16 February was signed. The Jonas Basanavičius Prize is bestowed for distinguished work within the previous five years in the fields of ethnic and cultural studies.

H-58 (Michigan county highway)

H-58 is a <a href="List%20of%20County-Designated%20Highways%20in%20Michigan">county-designated highway</a> in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> that runs east–west for approximately between the communities of <a href="Munising%2C%20Michigan">Munising</a> and <a href="Deer%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Deer Park</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>. The western section is routed through <a href="Pictured%20Rocks%20National%20Lakeshore">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a>, along the southern shore of <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>, and the adjacent <a href="Lake%20Superior%20State%20Forest">Lake Superior State Forest</a> in <a href="Alger%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alger County</a> while connecting Munising to the communities of <a href="Van%20Meer%2C%20Michigan">Van Meer</a> and <a href="Melstrand%2C%20Michigan">Melstrand</a>. At <a href="Grand%20Marais%2C%20Michigan">Grand Marais</a>, H-58 exits the national lakeshore area and runs through town. The segment running east of Grand Marais to Deer Park in <a href="Luce%20County%2C%20Michigan">Luce County</a> is a gravel road that connects to <a href="H-37%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-37</a> in <a href="Muskallonge%20Lake%20State%20Park">Muskallonge Lake State Park</a>.

A roadway was present along parts of today's H-58 by the late 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and connected with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and to fill in the gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-94</a> from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s.

The H-58 designation was created after the county-designated highway system itself was formed in 1970. Initially, only the section from Grand Marais to Deer Park was given the number; the remainder was added in 1972. The last sections to be paved in the 20th century were completed in 1974. The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> was required to build their own access road for the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the initial legislation that created the park. This requirement was rescinded by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> in 1998, and the park service was authorized to fund improvements to H-58 instead. Paving projects were completed between 2006 and 2010 so that the entire length of H-58 in Alger County is now paved; the section in Luce County is still a gravel road.

H-58 starts in Munising at an intersection with M-28. The highway follows the eastern end of Munising Street through the eastern side of the city by the Neenah Paper Mill, then turns northeasterly. The roadway runs outside of, and parallel to, the southern boundary of the <a href="Pictured%20Rocks%20National%20Lakeshore">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a>. The park visitors center, which is open year round, is located off H-58 on Sand Point Road at the west end of the park. The highway turns due east and runs through an intersection with <a href="H-13%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-13</a> (Connors Road). Leaving town, H-58 becomes Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road and enters the national park. East of the intersection with Carmody Road, the county road passes to the south of the Pictured Rocks Golf and Country Club before meeting the intersection with <a href="H-11%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-11</a> (Miners Castle Road). This latter road provides access to <a href="Miner%27s%20Castle">Miner's Castle</a>, a natural rock formation located on the shores of Lake Superior, and the Miners Falls. Further east, H-58 meets <a href="H-15%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-15</a> in <a href="Van%20Meer%2C%20Michigan">Van Meer</a>, site of the Bear Trap Inn and Bar. Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road turns south along H-15, and H-58 turns northeast along Melstrand Road to the community of <a href="Melstrand%2C%20Michigan">Melstrand</a>.
Melstrand is located outside the national lakeshore in the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20State%20Forest">Lake Superior State Forest</a>. H-58 continues through "burned and cut areas, meadows, maturing second growth, and the haunting sounds of silence" in the state forest. H-58 reenters the national lakeshore and approaches more Pictured Rocks facilities like the Hurricane River Campground. The road then travels northward towards Buck Hill, which is near the intersection with the Adams Truck Trail; at that intersection, there is a parking lot for <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a>s. Past this point, the road is closed to vehicles during the winter months each year; snow plows do not clear the snow from the roadway, allowing it to be used as a snowmobile trail. The area on each end of the park averages around of snowfall annually, while the National Park Service says that this central section is higher.
The road meanders through forest lands and fields as it continues northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists a chance to hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees to the east and the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The <a href="American%20Motorcyclist%20Association">American Motorcyclist Association</a> said of this segment of the roadway that it is "so close to the beach and lake that [one] can smell it when [he] rides." The lighthouse is listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the <a href="Hurricane%20River">Hurricane River</a> and turns southerly away from <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of <a href="Grand%20Marais%2C%20Michigan">Grand Marais</a>. On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach to the base of the Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These dunes reach heights of up to at a 35° incline. Hikers are advised to use the access points along H-58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face.
H-58 meets <a href="M-77%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-77</a> in Grand Marais. This town is the location of a small harbor that was once the home of a lumber shipping port. H-58 turns south to <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> along M-77 for about two blocks before turning back eastward. The county road runs along the southern edge of the harbor past the <a href="township%20%28United%20States%29">township</a>'s school and out of town. The pavement ends when the road leaves <a href="Alger%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alger County</a> for <a href="Luce%20County%2C%20Michigan">Luce County</a>.

H-58 follows a gravel roadway through the forested northwestern corner of Luce County. The roadway turns northeasterly and runs closer to Lake Superior as it approaches Deer Park. The road also carries the County Road 407 (CR 407) designation and the name Grand Marais Truck Trail. Near the Blind Sucker Flooding, a man-made reservoir, the truck trail turns south to intersect Deer Park Road. H-58 turns east on Deer Park Road and runs between Rainy and Reedy lakes to the south and Lake Superior to the north. The east end of H-58 is at an intersection with H-37 near <a href="Muskallonge%20Lake%20State%20Park">Muskallonge Lake State Park</a> in Deer Park, north of <a href="Newberry%2C%20Michigan">Newberry</a>. Deer Park is the location of a trio of resorts and remnants of a community that once included a sawmill, hotel and store. The state park is located on the shore of Muskallonge Lake and is visited by about 71,000 people each year.

A county road along part of the route of H-58 was present at by at least 1927; the road ran east and northeasterly from Munising to Kingston Corners where it followed what is now Adams Trail east to M-77. A second county road ran westward from Grand Marais. By 1929, <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-94</a> was rerouted through Alger County to follow Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road east from Munising to Van Meer and then south to Shingleton; that routing followed what is now H-58 and H-15. The section of county road between Van Meer and Melstrand was surfaced in gravel by 1936 with the remainder only an earthen road. By the end of the year, an earthen road was constructed east of Grand Marais to Deer Park. After the end of World War II, the gravel segment was extended north of Melstrand to the Buck Hill area, and the earthen road was extended between the Adams Trail and Grand Marais by way of Au Sable Point. East of Grand Marais, the roadway was improved with gravel to the county line. In late 1946 or early 1947, the first east of Grand Marais were paved; additional sections in Luce County were improved to gravel. All of the earthen road segments of what is now H-58 were improved to gravel road by the middle of 1958; the section between Van Meer and Melstrand as well as a section east of Grand Marais were paved.

In the early 1960s, M-94 was moved to follow M-28 between Munising and <a href="Shingleton%2C%20Michigan">Shingleton</a>. The section of Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road east of the junction with Connors Road was returned to county control by the middle of 1960, and the remainder westward into Munising was turned over on November 7, 1963. In late 1961, about was paved to the west of Grand Marais. The county-designated highway system was created around October 5, 1970, and the section of H-58 was shown on state maps for the first time in 1971. Initially, only the section between Grand Marais and Deer Park was marked as part of H-58. Within two years, the remainder was marked as H-58 from Munising northeasterly to Grand Marais; between Connors and Miners Castle roads, it was also marked as a section of H-13 where the two designations <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">ran concurrently</a> together. In 1974, the road was paved from Melstrand north to the Buck Hill area. The H-13 concurrency was removed in 2004 when the northern segment of H-13 along Miners Castle Road was redesignated <a href="H-11%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-11</a>.

The <a href="Pictured%20Rocks%20National%20Lakeshore">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a> was authorized on October 15, 1966, when President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> signed into law the enabling legislation. The park was inaugurated on October 6, 1972, in ceremonies in Munising. The original legislation that created the park included a mandate to build an access road along Lake Superior. When the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> conducted environmental studies on such a road in the mid-1990s, they decided on a road called the Beaver Basin Rim Road between Twelvemile Beach and Legion Lake. Area residents opposed the plan, preferring that the federal government instead improve the existing H-58. Representative <a href="Bart%20Stupak">Bart Stupak</a> lobbied his colleagues in Congress in 1996, saying that building the new road would cost twice as much as improving the existing H-58; Stupak also introduced legislation to remove the construction mandate from the park.

Because H-58 was under the jurisdiction of the county, and not the park, it was ineligible for park service funding. Appropriations legislation passed by Congress in 1998 allowed the park service to fund road improvements in the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore for county-maintained roads. Additional legislation reintroduced and sponsored by Stupak was also passed, removing the original road construction mandate from the park. On November 12, 1998, President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> signed the legislation which cleared the last hurdles; the park service was prohibited from building that road and instead authorized to help the Alger County Road Commission (ACRC) improve H-58. In 2005, the budgeted $13.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the paving and reconstruction project.

The ACRC implemented a five-stage plan to pave the remaining sections of the road between the Melstrand area and Grand Marais utilizing National Park Service funding. Plans were put into place by July 2006 to straighten some tight curves and realign the roadway in places. The commission designed the updated road for travel speeds of "to maintain the nature of the road and the park setting." One phase was divided into subsections to accommodate the bridge across the <a href="Hurricane%20River">Hurricane River</a>.
Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the boundary of the national lakeshore was held up, pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved for the first time or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River.

The final section was dedicated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 15, 2010, which marked the official opening to traffic. Final work was continued through the end of that month to complete the Hurricane River Bridge. Since the road was completed, traffic has increased. After paving, the new road has reduced travel times between Munising and Grand Marais from 90 to 45 minutes. Not all residents have been happy with the updated H-58; thousands of nails have been scattered along the road, and have led to flat tires on many vehicles. Police said at the time they believed it was intentional, but had no motive for the vandalism. Since the thoroughfare has re-opened, motorcyclists now frequent the highway, and a local group has named H-58 "one of the top five motorcycling roads in Upper Michigan", and it has been promoted by the <a href="American%20Motorcyclist%20Association">American Motorcyclist Association</a> in their guidebooks; riders enjoy the 198 curves and scenic vistas along the road.

Ancient Egyptian deities

Ancient Egyptian deities are the <a href="God%20%28male%20deity%29">gods</a> and <a href="goddess">goddess</a>es worshipped in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a>, which emerged sometime in <a href="prehistoric%20Egypt">prehistory</a>. Deities represented <a href="natural%20phenomenon">natural forces and phenomena</a>, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through <a href="sacrifice">offerings</a> and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to "<a href="maat">maat</a>", or divine order. After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the <a href="Egyptian%20temples">temples</a> where the rituals were carried out.

The gods' complex characteristics were expressed in <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">myths</a> and in intricate relationships between deities: family ties, loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in <a href="art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">art</a>—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features.

In different eras, various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society, including the <a href="solar%20deity">solar deity</a> <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, the mysterious god <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, and the <a href="mother%20goddess">mother goddess</a> <a href="Isis">Isis</a>. The highest deity was usually credited with the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">creation of the world</a> and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original <a href="polytheistic">polytheistic</a> view of the world, except possibly during the era of <a href="Atenism">Atenism</a> in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god <a href="Aten">Aten</a>.

Gods were assumed to be present throughout the world, capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society.

The beings in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian tradition who might be labeled as <a href="deities">deities</a> are difficult to count. Egyptian texts list the names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make vague, indirect references to other gods who are not even named. The <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a> <a href="James%20P.%20Allen">James P. Allen</a> estimates that more than 1,400 deities are named in Egyptian texts, whereas his colleague Christian Leitz says there are "thousands upon thousands" of gods.

The <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>'s terms for these beings were "nṯr", "god", and its <a href="grammatical%20gender">feminine</a> form "nṯrt", "goddess". Scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing <a href="etymologies">etymologies</a> for these words, but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance, and the terms' origin remains obscure. The <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> that were used as <a href="ideogram">ideogram</a>s and <a href="determinative">determinative</a>s in writing these words show some of the traits that the Egyptians connected with divinity. The most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole. Similar objects were placed at the entrances of <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a>, representing the presence of a deity, throughout <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20history">ancient Egyptian history</a>. Other such hieroglyphs include a falcon, reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons, and a seated male or female deity. The feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative, connecting goddesses with creation and birth, or with a cobra, reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities.

The Egyptians distinguished "nṯrw", "gods", from "rmṯ", "people", but the meanings of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly. The term "nṯr" may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life. Deceased humans were called "nṯr" because they were considered to be like the gods, whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt's lesser supernatural beings, which modern scholars often call "demons". Egyptian religious art also depicts places, objects, and concepts in human form. These personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings, only mentioned once or twice, that may be little more than metaphors.

Confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings, scholars have proposed various definitions of a "deity". One widely accepted definition, suggested by <a href="Jan%20Assmann">Jan Assmann</a>, says that a deity has a <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a>, is involved in some aspect of the universe, and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition. According to a different definition, by Dimitri Meeks, "nṯr" applied to any being that was the focus of ritual. From this perspective, "gods" included the king, who was called a god after his <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">coronation rites</a>, and deceased souls, who entered the divine realm through <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">funeral ceremonies</a>. Likewise, the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across Egypt.

The first written evidence of deities in Egypt comes from the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Early Dynastic Period</a> (c. 3100–2686 BC). Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding <a href="Predynastic%20Period">Predynastic Period</a> (before 3100 BC) and grown out of <a href="prehistoric%20religion">prehistoric religious beliefs</a>. Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures. Some of these images, such as stars and cattle, are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times, but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities. As Egyptian society grew more sophisticated, clearer signs of religious activity appeared. The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era, along with images that resemble the <a href="iconographies">iconographies</a> of known deities: the falcon that represents <a href="Horus">Horus</a> and several other gods, the crossed arrows that stand for <a href="Neith">Neith</a>, and the enigmatic "<a href="Set%20animal">Set animal</a>" that represents <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Set</a>.
Many Egyptologists and <a href="anthropology">anthropologists</a> have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times. <a href="Gustave%20J%C3%A9quier">Gustave Jéquier</a>, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive <a href="fetishism">fetishes</a>, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in human form, whereas <a href="Henri%20Frankfort">Henri Frankfort</a> argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are difficult to prove.

Predynastic Egypt originally consisted of small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions, many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. Others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite its political divisions.

The final step in the formation of <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian religion</a> was the unification of Egypt, in which rulers from <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a> made themselves <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s of the entire country. These <a href="sacred%20king">sacred king</a>s and their subordinates assumed the right to interact with the gods, and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion.

New deities continued to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities such as <a href="Isis">Isis</a> and <a href="Amun">Amun</a> are not known to have appeared until the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could inspire the creation of a deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects <a href="Imhotep">Imhotep</a> and <a href="Amenhotep%20son%20of%20Hapu">Amenhotep son of Hapu</a> were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.

Through contact with neighboring civilizations, the Egyptians also <a href="Syncretism%23Religious%20syncretism">adopted foreign deities</a>. <a href="Dedun">Dedun</a>, who is first mentioned in the Old Kingdom, may have come from <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, and <a href="Baal">Baal</a>, <a href="Anat">Anat</a>, and <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a>, among others, were adopted from <a href="Canaanite%20religion">Canaanite religion</a> during the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BC). In <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> times, from 332 BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship.

Modern knowledge of Egyptian beliefs about the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s and <a href="priest%23Ancient%20Egypt">priests</a>. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, most of whom were illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.

Most Egyptian deities represent <a href="natural%20phenomenon">natural</a> or <a href="social%20phenomenon">social phenomena</a>. The gods were generally said to be <a href="Immanence">immanent</a> in these phenomena—to be <a href="divine%20presence">present</a> within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces. The god <a href="Shu%20%28Egyptian%20deity%29">Shu</a> was the deification of all the world's air; the goddess <a href="Meretseger">Meretseger</a> oversaw a limited region of the earth, the <a href="Theban%20Necropolis">Theban Necropolis</a>; and the god <a href="Sia%20%28god%29">Sia</a> personified the abstract notion of <a href="perception">perception</a>. Major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena. For instance, <a href="Khnum">Khnum</a> was the god of <a href="Elephantine%20Island">Elephantine Island</a> in the midst of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual <a href="Nile%20flood">Nile flood</a> that fertilized the nation's farmland. Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life-giving function, he was said to create all living things, fashioning their bodies on a <a href="potter%27s%20wheel">potter's wheel</a>. Gods could share the same role in nature; <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, <a href="Atum">Atum</a>, <a href="Khepri">Khepri</a>, Horus, and other deities acted as <a href="Solar%20deity">sun gods</a>. Despite their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in common: maintaining "<a href="maat">maat</a>", the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess. But some deities represented disruption to "maat". Most prominently, <a href="Apep">Apep</a> was the force of chaos, constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe, and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it.

Not all aspects of existence were seen as deities. Although many deities were connected with the Nile, no god personified it in the way that Ra personified the sun. Short-lived phenomena, such as rainbows or eclipses, were not represented by gods; neither were fire, water, or many other components of the world.

The roles of each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are difficult to categorize or define. Despite this flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the <a href="Creator%20deity">creator god</a> could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not <a href="omniscience">omniscient</a>. <a href="Richard%20H.%20Wilkinson">Richard H. Wilkinson</a>, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that as beliefs about the god Amun evolved he was thought to approach omniscience and <a href="omnipresence">omnipresence</a>, and to <a href="transcendence%20%28religion%29">transcend</a> the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.

The deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called "minor divinities" or "demons" in modern writing, although there is no firm definition for these terms. Some demons were guardians of particular places, especially in the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>, the realm of the dead. Others wandered through the human world and the Duat, either as servants and messengers of the greater gods or as roving spirits that caused illness or other misfortunes among humans. Demons' position in the divine hierarchy was not fixed. The protective deities <a href="Bes">Bes</a> and <a href="Taweret">Taweret</a> originally had minor, demon-like roles, but over time they came to be credited with great influence. The most feared beings in the Duat were regarded as both disgusting and dangerous to humans. Over the course of Egyptian history, they came to be regarded as fundamentally inferior members of divine society and to represent the opposite of the beneficial, life-giving major gods. Yet even the most revered deities could sometimes exact vengeance on humans or each other, displaying a demon-like side to their character and blurring the boundaries between demons and gods.

Divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature. Except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order, the gods' actions maintained "maat" and created and sustained all living things. They did this work using a force the Egyptians called "<a href="heku">heka</a>", a term usually translated as "magic". "Heka" was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves.
The gods' actions in the present are described and praised in <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s and <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a>. In contrast, <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">mythology</a> mainly concerns the gods' actions during a vaguely imagined past in which the gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans. The events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present. Periodic occurrences were tied to events in the mythic past; the succession of each new pharaoh, for instance, reenacted Horus's accession to the throne of his father <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>.

Myths are metaphors for the gods' actions, which humans cannot fully understand. They contain seemingly contradictory ideas, each expressing a particular perspective on divine events. The contradictions in myth are part of the Egyptians' many-faceted approach to religious belief—what Henri Frankfort called a "multiplicity of approaches" to understanding the gods.

In myth, the gods behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique character traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, patron of writing and knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Different versions of a myth could portray different deities playing the same archetypal role, as in the myths of the <a href="Eye%20of%20Ra">Eye of Ra</a>, a feminine aspect of the sun god who was represented by many goddesses. Deities' mythic behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths lack highly developed characters and plots, because their symbolic meaning was more important than elaborate storytelling.

The first divine act is the creation of the cosmos, described in several <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">creation myths</a>. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the <a href="Ogdoad%20%28Egyptian%29">Ogdoad</a>, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a>, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as <a href="emanation">emanation</a>s of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.

A recurring theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maintain "maat" against the forces of disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the <a href="Osiris%20myth">myth of Osiris's murder</a>, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of <a href="Nun%20%28god%29">Nun</a>, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.

Gods were linked to specific regions of the universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulties in communicating with those in the world of the living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.

In the time after myth, most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they inhabited the <a href="cult%20image">cult image</a>s, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the <a href="patron%20deity">patron deity</a> for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> took control of the country at start of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god <a href="Montu">Montu</a> and then Amun—to national prominence.

In Egyptian belief, names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer. In keeping with this belief, the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins. The name of the predatory goddess <a href="Sekhmet">Sekhmet</a> means "powerful one", the name of the mysterious god Amun means "hidden one", and the name of <a href="Nekhbet">Nekhbet</a>, who was worshipped in the city of <a href="Nekheb">Nekheb</a>, means "she of Nekheb". Many other names have no certain meaning, even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role. The names of the sky goddess <a href="Nut%20%28goddess%29">Nut</a> and the earth god <a href="Geb">Geb</a> do not resemble the Egyptian terms for "sky" and "earth".

The Egyptians also devised false <a href="etymology">etymologies</a> giving more meanings to divine names. A passage in the <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a> renders the name of the funerary god <a href="Seker">Sokar</a> as "sk r", meaning "cleaning of the mouth", to link his name with his role in the <a href="Opening%20of%20the%20Mouth">Opening of the Mouth</a> ritual, while one in the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a> says the name is based on words shouted by Osiris in a moment of distress, connecting Sokar with the most important funerary deity.

The gods were believed to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the <a href="true%20name">true name</a> of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.

In addition to their names, gods were given <a href="epithet">epithet</a>s, like "possessor of splendor", "ruler of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>", or "lord of the sky", that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship. Because of the gods' multiple and overlapping roles, deities can have many epithets—with more important gods accumulating more titles—and the same epithet can apply to many deities. Some epithets eventually became separate deities, as with <a href="Werethekau">Werethekau</a>, an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning "great enchantress", which came to be treated as an independent goddess. The host of divine names and titles expresses the gods' multifarious nature.

The Egyptians regarded the division between male and female as fundamental to all beings, including deities. Some deities were androgynous, but most examples are found in the context of creation myths, in which the androgynous deity represents the undifferentiated state that existed before the world was created. Atum was primarily male but had a feminine aspect within himself, who was sometimes seen as a goddess, known as <a href="Iusaaset">Iusaaset</a> or <a href="Nebethetepet">Nebethetepet</a>. Creation began when Atum produced a sexually differentiated pair of deities: Shu and his consort <a href="Tefnut">Tefnut</a>. Similarly, Neith was said to possess male traits and was sometimes regarded as a creator goddess, but she was mainly seen as female.

Sex and gender were closely tied to creation and thus rebirth. Male gods were often connected with kingship and the active role in conceiving children. Female deities were often relegated to a supporting role, often as a constant or encompassing element, stimulating their male consorts' virility and nurturing their children, although goddesses were given a larger role in procreation late in Egyptian history. Goddesses acted as mythological mothers and wives of kings and thus as prototypes of human queenship. <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>, who was the mother or consort of Horus and the most important goddess for much of Egyptian history, exemplified this relationship between divinity and the king, although over time she was overshadowed by Isis.

Female deities also had a violent aspect that could be seen either positively, as with the goddesses <a href="Wadjet">Wadjet</a> and Nekhbet who protected the king, or negatively. The myth of the Eye of Ra contrasts feminine aggression with sexuality and nurturing, as the goddess rampages in the form of Sekhmet or another dangerous deity until the other gods appease her, at which point she becomes a benign goddess such as Hathor who, in some versions, then becomes the consort of a male god.

The Egyptian conception of sexuality was heavily focused on heterosexual reproduction, and homosexual acts were usually viewed with disapproval. Some texts nevertheless refer to homosexual behavior between male deities. In some cases, most notably when Set sexually assaulted Horus, these acts served to assert the dominance of the active partner and humiliate the submissive one. Other couplings between male deities could be viewed positively and even produce offspring, as in one text in which Ra and Shu united to create Khnum.

Egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, as the mother and protector of Horus, was a great healer as well as the patroness of kings. Such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed.
Family relationships are a common type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child <a href="Nefertum">Nefertum</a> at Memphis and Amun, <a href="Mut">Mut</a>, and <a href="Khonsu">Khonsu</a> at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief; Hathor could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.

Other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented a region of the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each <a href="nome%20%28Egypt%29">nome</a> (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, <a href="numbers%20in%20Egyptian%20mythology">symbolically important number</a> of deities. Paired gods sometimes have similar roles, as do Isis and her sister <a href="Nephthys">Nephthys</a> in their protection and support of Osiris. Other pairs stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four connote completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth Dynasty</a> kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon.

Nine, the product of three and three, represents a multitude, so the Egyptians called several large groups "enneads", or sets of nine, even if they had more than nine members. The most prominent ennead was the <a href="Ennead%20of%20Heliopolis">Ennead of Heliopolis</a>, an extended family of deities descended from the creator god Atum, which incorporates many important gods. The term "ennead" was often extended to include all of Egypt's deities.

This divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society. At the apex of this society was the <a href="king%20of%20the%20gods">king of the gods</a>, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra, the traditional king of the gods, to become a solar deity.

The gods were believed to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul">conception of the human soul</a>, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements. The "ba" was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its "ba"; thus, the sun was called the "ba" of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a "ka", another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's "ba" to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, were believed to house divine "ba"s in this way. Gods could be ascribed many "ba"s and "ka"s, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said to be one of the "ka"s of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the "ba" of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.

Nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations, which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods. Horus had many forms tied to particular places, including Horus of <a href="Nekhen">Nekhen</a>, Horus of <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a>, and Horus of <a href="Edfu">Edfu</a>. Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings. During the New Kingdom, one man was accused of stealing clothes by an <a href="oracle">oracle</a> supposed to communicate messages from Amun of Pe-Khenty. He consulted two other local oracles of Amun hoping for a different judgment. Gods' manifestations also differed according to their roles. Horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child, and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities.

Gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided. A god could be called the "ba" of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions were combined. Ra was connected with the local deity <a href="Sobek">Sobek</a> to form Sobek-Ra; with his fellow ruling god, Amun, to form Amun-Ra; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra-Horakhty; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On rare occasion, even deities of different sexes were joined in this way, producing combinations like Osiris-Neith and Mut-Min. This linking of deities is called <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a>. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems, although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between deities' roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. Syncretic combinations were not permanent; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge. Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions, such as Khenti-irty and <a href="Khenti-kheti">Khenti-kheti</a>, who became little more than local manifestations of him; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess, <a href="Bat%20%28goddess%29">Bat</a>; and an early funerary god, <a href="Khenti-Amentiu">Khenti-Amentiu</a>, was supplanted by Osiris and <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>.

In the reign of <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the <a href="Aten">Aten</a>, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, targeting Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called <a href="Atenism">Atenism</a>, differed dramatically from the <a href="Polytheism">polytheistic</a> worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism may not have been full <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a>, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, such as Maat, Shu, and Tefnut. For these reasons, the Egyptologist <a href="Dominic%20Montserrat">Dominic Montserrat</a> suggested that Akhenaten may have been <a href="Monolatrism">monolatrous</a>, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.

Scholars have long debated whether traditional Egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were, on a deeper level, unified. Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism, which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one, and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities. Another point of contention is the appearance of the word "god" in <a href="sebayt">wisdom literature</a>, where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities. In the early 20th century, for instance, <a href="E.%20A.%20Wallis%20Budge">E. A. Wallis Budge</a> believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic, but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite, who wrote the wisdom literature. His contemporary <a href="James%20Henry%20Breasted">James Henry Breasted</a> thought Egyptian religion was instead <a href="pantheistic">pantheistic</a>, with the power of the sun god present in all other gods, while <a href="Hermann%20Junker">Hermann Junker</a> argued that Egyptian civilization had been <a href="Urmonotheismus">originally monotheistic</a> and became polytheistic in the course of its history.

In 1971, <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a> published a study rebutting these views. He points out that in any given period many deities, even minor ones, were described as superior to all others. He also argues that the unspecified "god" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere. Although the combinations, manifestations, and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting, they were always restricted to a finite number of forms, never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way. <a href="Henotheism">Henotheism</a>, Hornung says, describes Egyptian religion better than other labels. An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment, without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on. Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth, at the time before creation, after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence.

Hornung's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows. Jan Assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom, beginning with a focus on Amun-Ra as the all-important sun god. In his view, Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend. It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods. Then, in the backlash against Atenism, priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way, one that coexisted with traditional polytheism. The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the "multiplicity of approaches" in Egyptian thought, as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by "identifying their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god, depending on the particular situation."

Egyptian writings describe the gods' bodies in detail. They are made of precious materials; their flesh is gold, their bones are silver, and their hair is <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>. They give off a scent that the Egyptians likened to the <a href="incense">incense</a> used in rituals. Some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities, including their height and eye color. Yet these characteristics are not fixed; in myths, gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes. Egyptian texts often refer to deities' true, underlying forms as "mysterious". The Egyptians' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal. They symbolize specific aspects of each deity's character, functioning much like the <a href="ideogram">ideogram</a>s in hieroglyphic writing. For this reason, the funerary god <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a> is commonly shown in <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian art</a> as a dog or <a href="jackal">jackal</a>, a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried <a href="Mummy">mummies</a>, in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection. His black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection.

Most deities were depicted in several ways. Hathor could be a cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms, so they can often be distinguished from one another by their <a href="Iconography">iconographies</a>. These forms include men and women (<a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a>), animals (<a href="zoomorphism">zoomorphism</a>), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. <a href="Mythological%20hybrid">Combinations of forms</a>, such as deities with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.
Certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god's identity. The head of a given divine image is particularly significant. In a hybrid image, the head represents the original form of the being depicted, so that, as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it, "a lion-headed goddess is a lion-goddess in human form, while a royal <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a>, conversely, is a man who has assumed the form of a lion." Divine headdresses, which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods' heads, are another important indicator. In contrast, the objects held in gods' hands tend to be generic. Male deities hold "<a href="was%20%28sceptre%29">was</a>" staffs, goddesses hold stalks of <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, and both sexes carry "<a href="ankh">ankh</a>" signs, representing the Egyptian word for "life", to symbolize their life-giving power.

The forms in which the gods are shown, although diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major characteristics in common. Bulls and rams were associated with virility, cows and falcons with the sky, hippopotami with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt in the early stages of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Second Intermediate Period</a> (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false beard, and often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses.

The basic anthropomorphic form varies. Child gods are depicted nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts, signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy figure of the god <a href="Hapi%20%28Nile%20god%29">Hapi</a> alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a "mummiform" appearance, with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities.

In official writings, pharaohs are said to be divine, and they are constantly depicted in the company of the deities of the pantheon. Each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered the successors of the gods who had ruled Egypt in mythic prehistory. Living kings were equated with Horus and called the "son" of many male deities, particularly Osiris and Ra; deceased kings were equated with these elder gods. King's wives and mothers were likened to many goddesses. The few women who made themselves pharaohs, such as <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a>, connected themselves with these same goddesses while adopting much of the masculine imagery of kingship. Pharaohs had their own <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>s where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths. But few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes, and non-official texts portray kings in a human light. For these reasons, scholars disagree about how genuinely most Egyptians believed the king to be a god. He may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies.

However much it was believed, the king's divine status was the rationale for his role as Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of <a href="sacrifice">offerings</a> to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining "maat". The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with "maat" so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained "maat" in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.

Although the Egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">literature</a>, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.

The "ba" of a god was said to periodically leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was "ḏsr"—"sacred"—was isolated and <a href="Ritual%20purification">ritually pure</a>, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the <a href="Apis%20%28god%29">Apis bull</a>, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could come close to the gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to <a href="Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">Egyptian afterlife beliefs</a>, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature.
Temples, where the state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods.

To insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes.

Egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order. In the New Kingdom, when other nations were under Egyptian control, foreigners were said to be under the sun god's benign rule in the same way that Egyptians were.

Thoth, as the overseer of time, was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods. Other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives, including <a href="Meskhenet">Meskhenet</a> and <a href="Renenutet">Renenutet</a>, both of whom presided over birth, and <a href="Shai">Shai</a>, the personification of <a href="fate">fate</a>. Thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the Egyptian concept of fate, although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well. Several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions, working through a person's "heart"—the seat of emotion and intellect in Egyptian belief. Deities were also believed to give commands, instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples. Egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons, and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes. Morality in ancient Egypt was based on the concept of "maat", which, when applied to human society, meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well-being of other people. Because deities were the upholders of "maat", morality was connected with them. For example, the gods judged humans' moral righteousness after death, and by the New Kingdom, a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife. In general, however, morality was based on practical ways to uphold "maat" in daily life, rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out.
Humans had <a href="free%20will">free will</a> to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by "maat", but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its "ba", the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine "ba"s. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: <a href="Shed%20%28deity%29">Shed</a>, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and <a href="Petbe">Petbe</a>, an <a href="apotropaic">apotropaic</a> god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.

Egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen as a product of "<a href="isfet%20%28Egyptian%20mythology%29">isfet</a>", the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of "maat", and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with "isfet", such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. Some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give <a href="theodicies">theodicies</a> in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of "maat" grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by <a href="oracle">oracle</a>s communicating the gods' will.

Official religious practices, which maintained "maat" for the benefit of all Egypt, were related to, but distinct from, the religious practices of ordinary people, who sought the gods' help for their personal problems.

Official religion involved a variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition to maintaining "maat" for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.

Festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a <a href="Barque%20shrine">barque</a>-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from <a href="Dendera%20Temple">Dendera Temple</a> visited her consort Horus at the <a href="Temple%20of%20Edfu">Temple of Edfu</a>. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.

Personal interaction with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, that were supposed to convey gods' answers to questions. <a href="Amulet">Amulet</a>s and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive characteristics to the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used "heka", the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.

Prayer and private offerings are generally called "personal piety": acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god. Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom. <a href="Votive">Votive</a> offerings and personal names, many of which are <a href="theophoric%20name">theophoric</a>, suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods. But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom, reaching a peak late in that era. Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change—whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions. Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples. They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on <a href="stelae">stelae</a>. They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to, or that symbolized the result they desired; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility. Occasionally, a person took a particular god as a patron, dedicating his or her property or labor to the god's cult. These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history. These later eras saw more religious innovations, including the practice of giving <a href="animal%20mummies">animal mummies</a> as offerings to deities depicted in animal form, such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess <a href="Bastet">Bastet</a>. Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship, but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition.

The worship of some Egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands, especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom, when those regions were under pharaonic control. In Canaan, the exported deities, including Hathor, Amun, and Set, were often syncretized with native gods, who in turn spread to Egypt. The Egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in Canaan, and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region. In contrast, many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia. After the end of Egyptian rule there, the imported gods, particularly Amun and Isis, were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia's independent <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kingdom of Kush</a>. These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt, so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen, the "<a href="kandake">kandake</a>". Some deities reached farther. Taweret became a goddess in <a href="Minoan%20Crete">Minoan Crete</a>, and Amun's oracle at <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> was known to and consulted by people across the Mediterranean region.
Under the Greek <a href="Ptolemaic%20Dynasty">Ptolemaic Dynasty</a> and then <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman rule</a>, Greeks and Romans introduced their own deities to Egypt. These newcomers equated the Egyptian gods with their own, as part of the Greco-Roman tradition of "<a href="interpretatio%20graeca">interpretatio graeca</a>". The worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones. Instead, <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">Greek</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20deities">Roman gods</a> were adopted as manifestations of Egyptian ones. Egyptian cults sometimes incorporated <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek language</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">philosophy</a>, iconography, and even temple architecture. Meanwhile, the cults of several Egyptian deities—particularly Isis, Osiris, Anubis, the form of Horus named <a href="Harpocrates">Harpocrates</a>, and the fused Greco-Egyptian god <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a>—were adopted into <a href="religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman religion</a> and spread across the Roman Empire. Roman emperors, like Ptolemaic kings before them, invoked Isis and Serapis to endorse their authority, inside and outside Egypt. In the empire's complex mix of religious traditions, Thoth was transmuted into the legendary <a href="Esotericism">esoteric</a> teacher <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a>, and Isis, who was venerated from Britain to Mesopotamia, became the focus of a Greek-style <a href="mysteries%20of%20Isis">mystery cult</a>. Isis and Hermes Trismegistus were both prominent in the <a href="Western%20esoteric%20tradition">Western esoteric tradition</a> that grew from the Roman religious world.

Temples and cults in Egypt itself declined as the Roman economy deteriorated in the third century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, <a href="Christians">Christians</a> suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at <a href="Philae">Philae</a>, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. In contrast, many of the practices involved in their worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted as part of the <a href="Coptic%20Church">Coptic Church</a>. Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time, scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and <a href="Islam%20in%20Egypt">Muslim</a>, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.

Rudd Concession

The Rudd Concession, a written <a href="concession%20%28contract%29">concession</a> for exclusive mining rights in <a href="Matabeleland">Matabeleland</a>, <a href="Mashonaland">Mashonaland</a> and other adjoining territories in what is today Zimbabwe, was granted by <a href="Lobengula">King Lobengula</a> of Matabeleland to <a href="Charles%20Rudd">Charles Rudd</a>, <a href="James%20Rochfort%20Maguire">James Rochfort Maguire</a> and Francis Thompson, three agents acting on behalf of the South African-based politician and businessman <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a> in October 1889, and thereafter for the <a href="Pioneer%20Column">Pioneer Column</a>'s occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">administration</a> and development in the country that eventually became <a href="Rhodesia%20%28name%29">Rhodesia</a>, named after Rhodes, in 1895.

Rhodes's pursuit of the exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> as part of his personal ambition for a <a href="Cape%20to%20Cairo%20Railway">Cape to Cairo Railway</a>—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a <a href="chartered%20company">chartered company</a>, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a>–<a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo</a> watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Matabele</a> peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> against <a href="Edward%20Arthur%20Maund">Edward Arthur Maund</a>, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of "<a href="inDuna">izinDuna</a>" (tribal leaders).

The concession conferred on the grantees the sole rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, as well as the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.

After Rhodes and the London consortium agreed to pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the next few months, prompting the Prime Minister, <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, to approve the royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later. Attempting to set up a rival to the Rudd Concession, Lobengula granted similar rights to the German businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891, but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well. Company troops conquered Matabeleland during the <a href="First%20Matabele%20War">First Matabele War</a> of , and Lobengula died from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in exile soon after.

During the 1810s, the <a href="Zulu%20Kingdom">Zulu Kingdom</a> was established in southern Africa by the warrior king <a href="Shaka">Shaka</a>, who united a number of rival clans into a centralised monarchy. Among the Zulu Kingdom's main leaders and military commanders was <a href="Mzilikazi">Mzilikazi</a>, who enjoyed high royal favour for a time, but ultimately provoked the king's wrath by repeatedly offending him. When Shaka forced Mzilikazi and his followers to leave the country in 1823, they moved north-west to the Transvaal, where they became known as the Ndebele or "<a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Matabele</a>"—both names mean "men of the long shields". Amid the period of war and chaos locally called "<a href="mfecane">mfecane</a>" ("the crushing"), the Matabele quickly became the region's dominant tribe. In 1836, they negotiated a peace treaty with <a href="Benjamin%20d%27Urban">Sir Benjamin d'Urban</a>, Governor of the <a href="British%20Cape%20Colony">British Cape Colony</a>, but the same year <a href="Boer">Boer</a> <a href="Voortrekkers">Voortrekkers</a> moved to the area, during their <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> away from British rule in the Cape. These new arrivals soon toppled Mzilikazi's domination of the Transvaal, compelling him to lead another migration north in 1838. Crossing the <a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo River</a>, the Matabele settled in the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a>–Limpopo watershed's south-west; this area has since been called <a href="Matabeleland">Matabeleland</a>.

Matabele culture mirrored that of the Zulus in many aspects. The Matabele language, <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20language">Sindebele</a>, was largely based on <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a>—and just like Zululand, Matabeleland had a strong martial tradition. Matabele men went through a Spartan upbringing, designed to produce disciplined warriors, and military organisation largely dictated the distribution of administrative responsibilities. The "inkosi" (king) appointed a number of "<a href="inDuna">izinDuna</a>" (or indunas), who acted as tribal leaders in both military and civilian matters. Like the Zulus, the Matabele referred to a regiment of warriors as an "<a href="impi">impi</a>". The <a href="Shona%20people">Mashona people</a>, who had inhabited the north-east of the region for centuries, greatly outnumbered the Matabele, but were weaker militarily, and so to a large degree entered a state of tributary submission to them. Mzilikazi agreed to two treaties with the Transvaal Boers in 1853, first with <a href="Hendrik%20Potgieter">Hendrik Potgieter</a> (who died shortly before negotiations ended), then with <a href="Andries%20Pretorius">Andries Pretorius</a>; the first of these, which did not bear Mzilikazi's own mark, purported to make Matabeleland a virtual Transvaal protectorate, while the second, which was more properly enacted, comprised a more equal peace agreement.
After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son <a href="Lobengula">Lobengula</a> replaced him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; according to the South African <a href="big-game%20hunting">big-game hunter</a> Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal <a href="kraal">kraal</a> at <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a>, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining <a href="concession%20%28contract%29">concessions</a> and hunting licences to white visitors in return for <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds sterling</a>, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed by one of the whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.

For unclear reasons, Lobengula's attitude towards foreigners reversed sharply during the late 1870s. He discarded his Western clothes in favour of more traditional animal-skin garments, stopped supporting trading enterprises, and began to restrict the movement of whites into and around his country. However, the whites kept coming, particularly after the discovery in 1886 of gold deposits in the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a> (or Transvaal), which prompted the <a href="Witwatersrand%20Gold%20Rush">Witwatersrand Gold Rush</a> and the founding of <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. After rumours spread among the Witwatersrand (or Rand) prospectors of even richer tracts, "a second Rand", north of the Limpopo, the miners began to trek north to seek concessions from Lobengula that would allow them to search for gold in Matabeleland and <a href="Mashonaland">Mashonaland</a>. These efforts were mostly in vain. Apart from the <a href="Tati%20Concessions%20Land">Tati Concession</a>, which covered a small strip of land on the border with the <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland Protectorate</a> where miners had operated since 1868, mining operations in the watershed remained few and far between.

The foremost business and political figure in southern Africa at this time was <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, a vicar's son who had arrived from England in 1870, aged 17. Since entering the diamond trade at <a href="Kimberley%2C%20Northern%20Cape">Kimberley</a> in 1871, Rhodes had gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market with the help of <a href="Charles%20Rudd">Charles Rudd</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Beit">Alfred Beit</a> and other business associates, as well as the generous financial backing of <a href="Nathan%20Mayer%20Rothschild">Nathan Mayer Rothschild</a>. Rhodes was also a member of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape Parliament</a>, having been elected in 1881. Amid the European <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>, he envisioned the annexation to the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> of territories that would connect the Cape, at Africa's southern tip, with <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, the Egyptian city at the northern end of the continent, and allow for the construction of a <a href="Cape%20to%20Cairo%20Railway">railway linking the two</a>. This ambition was directly challenged in the south by the presence of the <a href="Boer%20republics">Boer republics</a> and, just to the north of them, Lobengula's domains. The fact that the Zambezi–Limpopo region did not fall into any of the "<a href="sphere%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a>" defined at the <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference</a> further complicated matters; the Transvaalers, Germans and Portuguese were all also showing interest in the area, much to the annoyance of both Lobengula and Rhodes.

Rhodes began advocating the annexation by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure to a number of senior colonial officials, most prominently the <a href="High%20Commissioner%20for%20Southern%20Africa">High Commissioner for Southern Africa</a>, <a href="Hercules%20Robinson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rosmead">Sir Hercules Robinson</a>, and <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%20Alexander%20Shippard">Sidney Shippard</a>, Britain's administrator in the <a href="British%20Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland Crown colony</a> (comprising that country's southern part). Shippard, an old friend of Rhodes, was soon won over to the idea, and in May 1887 the administrator wrote to Robinson strongly endorsing annexation of the territories, particularly Mashonaland, which he described as "beyond comparison the most valuable country south of the Zambezi". It was the Boers, however, who were first to achieve diplomatic successes with Lobengula. Pieter Grobler secured a treaty of "renewal of friendship" between Matabeleland and the South African Republic in July 1887. The same month, Robinson organised the appointment of <a href="John%20Smith%20Moffat">John Smith Moffat</a>, a locally born missionary, as assistant commissioner in Bechuanaland. Moffat, well-known to Lobengula, was given this position in the hope that he might make the king less cordial with the Boers and more pro-British.
In September 1887, Robinson wrote to Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant concessions of any kind to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, but that it was a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.

In <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, in early December, another British agent met <a href="Paul%20Kruger">Paul Kruger</a>, the President of the South African Republic, who reportedly said that his government now regarded Matabeleland as under Transvaal "protection and sovereignty", and that one of the clauses of the Grobler treaty had been that Lobengula could not "grant any concessions or make any contact with anybody whatsoever" without Pretoria's approval. Meeting at <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a> on Christmas Day, Rhodes, Shippard and Robinson agreed to instruct Moffat to investigate the matter with Lobengula and to secure a copy of the Grobler treaty for further clarification, as well as to arrange a formal Anglo-Matabele treaty, which would have provisions included to prevent Lobengula from making any more agreements with foreign powers other than Britain.

Lobengula was alarmed by how some were perceiving his dealings with Grobler, and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners. Despite his familiarity with Moffat, the king did not consider him above suspicion, and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general, "they may like us better, but they fear the Boers more". Moffat's negotiations with the king and "izinDuna" were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836. He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case. On 11 February 1888, Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal at the foot of the agreement. The document proclaimed that the Matabele and British were now at peace, that Lobengula would not enter any kind of diplomatic correspondence with any country apart from Britain, and that the king would not "sell, alienate or cede" any part of Matabeleland or Mashonaland to anybody.
The document was unilateral in form, describing only what Lobengula would do to prevent any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was dubious about this and the fact that none of the "izinDuna" had signed the proclamation, and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty. Robinson replied in the negative, reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so soon would only make him suspicious. Britain's ministers at <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a> perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain, as it did not commit Her Majesty's Government to any particular course of action. <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, the British Prime Minister, ruled that Moffat's treaty trumped Grobler's, despite being signed at a later date, because the <a href="London%20Convention%20%281884%29">London Convention of 1884</a> precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>; treaties with "native tribes" north of the Limpopo were permitted, but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe, and should instead be considered a nation. He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was "<a href="ultra%20vires">ultra vires</a>" and legally meaningless. Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement, which was announced to the public in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> on 25 April 1888.

For Rhodes, the agreement Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time that allowed him to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests. A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi, but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion. In March 1888, Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor, the circus showman turned diamond millionaire <a href="Barney%20Barnato">Barney Barnato</a>, to form <a href="De%20Beers">De Beers Consolidated Mines</a>, a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90% of world diamond production. Barnato wanted to limit De Beers to mining diamonds, but Rhodes insisted that he was going to use the company to "win the north": to this end, he ensured that the De Beers trust deed enabled activities far removed from mining, including banking and railway-building, the ability to annex and govern land, and the raising of armed forces. All this gave the immensely wealthy company powers not unlike those of the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>, which had <a href="Company%20rule%20in%20India">governed</a> India on Britain's behalf from 1757 to 1857. Through De Beers and <a href="Gold%20Fields">Gold Fields of South Africa</a>, the gold-mining firm he had recently started with Charles Rudd, Rhodes had both the capacity and the financial means to make his dream of an African empire a reality, but to make such ambitions practicable, he would first have to acquire a <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> empowering him to take personal control of the relevant territories on Britain's behalf. To secure this royal charter, he would need to present Whitehall with a concession, signed by a native ruler, granting to Rhodes the exclusive mining rights in the lands he hoped to annex.

Rhodes faced competition for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and <a href="Edric%20Gifford%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Gifford">Lord Gifford</a>, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent <a href="Edward%20Arthur%20Maund">Edward Arthur Maund</a>, who had served with <a href="Charles%20Warren">Sir Charles Warren</a> in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, towards the end of this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to <a href="Henry%20Holland%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Knutsford">Lord Knutsford</a>, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a>, seeking his approval for their designs.

The urgency of negotiating a concession was made clear to Rhodes during a visit to London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. "Someone has to get the country, and I think we should have the best chance," Rhodes told Rothschild; "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy ... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen ... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella."
Rhodes and Beit put Rudd at the head of their new negotiating team because of his extensive experience negotiating the purchase of Boers' farms for gold prospecting. Because Rudd knew little of indigenous African customs and languages, Rhodes added Francis "Matabele" Thompson, an employee of his who had for years run the reserves and compounds that housed the black labourers at the diamond fields. Thompson was fluent in <a href="Tswana%20language">Setswana</a>, the language of the <a href="Tswana%20people">Tswana people</a> to Lobengula's south-west, and therefore could communicate directly and articulately with the king, who also knew the language. <a href="James%20Rochfort%20Maguire">James Rochfort Maguire</a>, an Irish barrister Rhodes had known at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a>, was recruited as a third member.

Many analysts find the inclusion of the cultured, metropolitan Maguire puzzling—it is often suggested that he was brought along so he could couch the document in the elaborate legal language of the English bar, and thus make it unchallengeable, but as the historian John Galbraith comments, the kind of agreement that was required was hardly complicated enough to merit the considerable expense and inconvenience of bringing Maguire along. In his biography of Rhodes, <a href="Robert%20I.%20Rotberg">Robert I Rotberg</a> suggests that he may have intended Maguire to lend Rudd's expedition "a touch of culture and class", in the hope that this might impress Lobengula and rival would-be concessionaires. One of the advantages held by the London syndicate was the societal prestige of Gifford in particular, and Rhodes hoped to counter this through Maguire. Rudd's party ultimately comprised himself, Thompson, Maguire, J G Dreyer (their Dutch wagon driver), a fifth white man, a <a href="Cape%20Coloured">Cape Coloured</a>, an African American and two black servants.

Maund arrived in Cape Town in late June 1888 and attempted to gain Robinson's approval for the Cawston–Gifford bid. Robinson was reserved in his answers, saying that he supported the development of Matabeleland by a company with this kind of backing, but did not feel he could commit to endorsing Cawston and Gifford exclusively while there remained other potential concessionaires, most prominently Rhodes—certainly not without unequivocal instructions from Whitehall. While Rudd's party gathered and prepared in Kimberley, Maund travelled north, and reached the diamond mines at the start of July. On 14 July, in Bulawayo, agents representing a consortium headed by the South African-based entrepreneur Thomas Leask received a mining concession from Lobengula, covering all of his country, and pledging half of the proceeds to the king. When he learned of this latter condition Leask was distraught, saying the concession was "commercially valueless". Moffat pointed out to Leask that his group did not have the resources to act on the concession anyway, and that both Rhodes and the London syndicate did; at Moffat's suggestion, Leask decided to wait and sell his concession to whichever big business group gained a new agreement from Lobengula. Neither Rhodes's group, the Cawston–Gifford consortium nor the British colonial officials immediately learned of the Leask concession.

In early July 1888, Rhodes returned from London and met with Robinson, proposing the establishment of a <a href="chartered%20company">chartered company</a> to govern and develop south-central Africa, with himself at its head, and similar powers to the <a href="North%20Borneo%20Chartered%20Company">British North Borneo</a>, <a href="Imperial%20British%20East%20Africa%20Company">Imperial British East Africa</a> and <a href="Royal%20Niger%20Company">Royal Niger Companies</a>. Rhodes said that this company would take control of those parts of Matabeleland and Mashonaland "not in use" by the local people, demarcate reserved areas for the indigenous population, and thereafter defend both, while developing the lands not reserved for natives. In this way, he concluded, Matabele and Mashona interests would be protected, and south-central Africa would be developed, all without a penny from <a href="HM%20Treasury">Her Majesty's Treasury</a>. Robinson wrote to Knutsford on 21 July that he thought Whitehall should back this idea; he surmised that the Boers would receive British expansion into the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed better if it came in the form of a chartered company than if it occurred with the creation of a new Crown colony. He furthermore wrote a letter for Rudd's party to carry to Bulawayo, recommending Rudd and his companions to Lobengula.
Maund left Kimberley in July, well ahead of the Rudd party. Rudd's negotiating team, armed with Robinson's endorsement, was still far from ready—they left Kimberley only on 15 August—but Moffat, travelling from <a href="Shoshong">Shoshong</a> in Bechuanaland, was ahead of both expeditions. He reached Bulawayo in late August to find the kraal filled with white concession-hunters. The various bidders attempted to woo the king with a series of gifts and favours, but won little to show for it.

Between Kimberley and <a href="Mahikeng">Mafeking</a>, Maund learned from Shippard that Grobler had been killed by a group of <a href="Mangwato%20tribe">Ngwato</a> warriors while returning to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, <a href="Khama%20III">Khama III</a>, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund.

Rudd, Thompson and Maguire immediately went to present themselves to Lobengula, who came out from his private quarters without hesitation and politely greeted the visitors. Through a Sindebele interpreter, Rudd introduced himself and the others, explained on whose behalf they acted, said they had come for an amiable sojourn, and presented the king with a gift of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>100.

After the subject of business was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue easier for him to manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.

Accompanied by <a href="Hamilton%20Goold-Adams">Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams</a> and 16 policemen, Shippard arrived in mid-October 1888. The king suspended concession negotiations in favour of meetings with him. The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted on behalf of a powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [Henry Morton] <a href="Henry%20Morton%20Stanley">Stanley</a> put on the <a href="Lualaba%20River">Upper Congo</a> ... Stick to <a href="Home%20rule">Home Rule</a> and Matabeleland for the Matabele[,] I am sure it is the ticket."

As October passed without major headway, Rudd grew anxious to return to the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. "You must not leave a vacuum," Rhodes instructed. "Leave Thompson and Maguire if necessary or wait until I can join ... if we get anything we must always have someone resident". Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. <a href="Charles%20Helm">Charles Helm</a>, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people."

After these talks with Rudd, Lobengula called an "<a href="indaba">indaba</a>" (conference) of over 100 "izinDuna" to present the proposed concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It soon became clear that opinion was split: most of the younger "izinDuna" were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older "izinDuna" were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, but there was also a case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.
For many at the "indaba", the most pressing motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged to protect him from incursions by the Boers.

Rudd was offering generous terms that few competitors could hope to even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 <a href="Martini%E2%80%93Henry">Martini–Henry</a> breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he had at the time between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own "impis". Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.

The final round of negotiations started at the royal kraal on the morning of 30 October. The talks took place at an "indaba" between the "izinDuna" and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The "izinDuna" pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering "the whole country". When the "izinDuna" demurred, Thompson insisted, "No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the "izinDuna", who did not seem to know where these places were. "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The "izinDuna" were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that "inDuna" Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.

After speaking with Lotshe and Thompson, the king was still hesitant to make a decision. Thompson appealed to Lobengula with a rhetorical question: "Who gives a man an "<a href="assegai">assegai</a>" [spear] if he expects to be attacked by him afterwards?" Seeing the allusion to the offered Martini–Henry rifles, Lobengula was swayed by this logic, and made up his mind to grant the concession. "Bring me the fly-blown paper and I will sign it," he said. Thompson briefly left the room to call Rudd, Maguire, Helm and Dreyer in, and they sat in a semi-circle around the king. Lobengula then put his mark to the concession, which read:

As Lobengula inscribed his mark at the foot of the paper, Maguire turned to Thompson and said "Thompson, this is the epoch of our lives." Once Rudd, Maguire and Thompson had signed the concession, Helm and Dreyer added their signatures as witnesses, and Helm wrote an endorsement beside the terms:

Lobengula refused to allow any of the "izinDuna" to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's interpretation was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's "indaba", and so did not think it necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his "izinDuna" alongside his own.

Within hours, Rudd and Dreyer were hurrying south to present the document to Rhodes, travelling by mule cart, the fastest mode of transport available. Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges. Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888, a mere 20 days after the document's signing, and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would surely not be broken until the railway was laid into the interior. Rhodes was elated by Rudd's results, describing the concession as "so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia". Both in high spirits, the pair travelled to Cape Town by train, and presented themselves to Robinson on 21 November.

Robinson was pleased to learn of Rudd's success. The High Commissioner wanted to <a href="public%20journal">gazette</a> the concession immediately, but Rhodes knew that the promise to arm Lobengula with 1,000 Martini–Henrys would be received with apprehension elsewhere in South Africa, especially among Boers; he suggested that this aspect of the concession should be kept quiet until the guns were already in Bechuanaland. Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini–Henrys, which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson, and published in the "<a href="Cape%20Times">Cape Times</a>" and "<a href="Cape%20Argus">Cape Argus</a>" newspapers on 24 November 1888. The altered version described the agreed price for the Zambezi–Limpopo mining monopoly as "the valuable consideration of a large monthly payment in cash, a gunboat for defensive purposes on the Zambesi, and other services." Two days later, the "Cape Times" printed a notice from Lobengula:

But the king was already beginning to receive reports telling him that he had been hoodwinked into "selling his country". Word abounded in Bulawayo that with the Rudd Concession (as the document became called), Lobengula had signed away far more impressive rights than he had thought. Some of the Matabele began to question the king's judgement. While the "izinDuna" looked on anxiously, Moffat questioned whether Lobengula would be able to keep control. Thompson was summoned by the "izinDuna" and interrogated for over 10 hours before being released; according to Thompson, they were "prepared to suspect even the king himself". Rumours spread among the kraal's white residents of a <a href="Filibuster%20%28military%29">freebooter</a> force in the South African Republic that allegedly intended to invade and support Gambo, a prominent "inDuna", in overthrowing and killing Lobengula. Horrified by these developments, Lobengula attempted to secure his position by deflecting blame. "InDuna" Lotshe, who had supported granting the concession, was condemned for having misled his king and executed, along with his extended family and followers—over 300 men, women and children in all. Meanwhile, Rhodes and Rudd returned to Kimberley, and Robinson wrote to the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> at Whitehall on 5 December 1888 to inform them of Rudd's concession.

While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he was only repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the concession itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his "izinDuna", Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his "izinDuna" to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the <a href="Mazowe%20River">Mazoe</a> valley, the king replied "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, then I will talk about that." Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Natal</a>, was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888.

Around this time, a group of Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, approached Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one of the terms of the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go at the head of a Matabele "impi" to turn Haggard away. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini–Henrys: "If rifles part of consideration, as reported, do you think there will be danger of complications arising from this?" Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with "assegais", so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous. He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference.

Surprised by the news of a Matabele mission to London, Rhodes attempted to publicly downplay the credentials of the "izinDuna" and to stop them from leaving Africa. When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend, associate and housemate Dr <a href="Leander%20Starr%20Jameson">Leander Starr Jameson</a>—who himself held the rank of "inDuna", having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment—to invite Maund to their cottage. Maund was suspicious, but came anyway. At the cottage, Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate. Maund refused, prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town. The "izinDuna" reached Cape Town in mid-January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said; to delay their departure, Robinson discredited them, Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London, saying that Shippard had described Maund as "mendacious" and "dangerous", Colenbrander as "hopelessly unreliable", and Babayane and Mshete as not actually "izinDuna" or even headmen. Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was pointless to try to go on while Robinson continued in this vein.

Rhodes then arrived in Cape Town to talk again with Maund. His mood was markedly different: after looking over Lobengula's message to Queen Victoria, he said that he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him. He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers. Maund presumed that Rhodes's shift in attitude had come about because of his own influence, coupled with the threat to Rhodes's concession posed by the Matabele mission, but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford, who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south-central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes. They had wired Rhodes, who had in turn come back to Maund. The unification, which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long-standing stalemate, was happily received by both sides; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes's considerable financial and political resources, and Rhodes's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it.

There still remained the question of Leask's concession, the existence of which Rudd's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo towards the end of October. Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired: "I quite see that worthless as [Leask's] concession is, it logically destroys yours," he told Rudd. This loose end was tied up in late January 1889, when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates, James Fairbairn and George Phillips, in Johannesburg. Leask was given £2,000 in cash and a 10% interest in the Rudd Concession, and allowed to retain a 10% share in his own agreement with Lobengula. Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of £300 each. In Cape Town, with Rhodes's opposition removed, Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission, cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all, so they should be allowed to board ship for England.

Meanwhile, in Bulawayo, South African newspaper reports of the concession started to arrive in the middle of January 1889. William Tainton, one of the local white residents, translated a press cutting for Lobengula, adding a few embellishments of his own: he told the king that he had sold his country, that the grantees could dig for minerals anywhere they liked, including in and around kraals, and that they could bring an army into Matabeleland to depose Lobengula in favour of a new chief. The king told Helm to read back and translate the copy of the concession that had remained in Bulawayo; Helm did so, and pointed out that none of the allegations Tainton had made were actually reflected in the text. Lobengula then said he wished to dictate an announcement. After Helm refused, Tainton translated and transcribed the king's words:

This notice was published in the "Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle" on 2 February 1889. A grand "indaba" of the "izinDuna" and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The "izinDuna" questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of the concession was led not by the "izinDuna", but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.

Tainton and the other white opponents of the concession contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" the mining yield. William Mzisi, a <a href="Fengu%20people">Fengu</a> from the Cape, who had been to the diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: "You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.

Helm was painted as a suspicious figure by some of the "izinDuna" because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was compounded by the fact that Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at <a href="Inyati">Inyati</a>, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The "izinDuna" concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.

Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire received a number of threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some <a href="eau%20de%20Cologne">eau de Cologne</a> into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.

Rhodes sent the first shipments of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr <a href="Frederick%20Rutherfoord%20Harris">Frederick Rutherfoord Harris</a> and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula had so far accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued to do so for years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his "izinDuna" revoked their recognition of the document.

Following their long delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the "Moor". They disembarked at <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> in early March 1889, and travelled by train to London, where they checked into the Berners Hotel on <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a>. They were invited to <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two "izinDuna" and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary said that it would be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.

The "izinDuna" stayed in London throughout the month of March, attending a number of dinners in their honour, including one hosted by the <a href="Aborigines%27%20Protection%20Society">Aborigines' Protection Society</a>. The Society sent a letter to Lobengula, advising him to be "wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good to you and your people". The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including <a href="London%20Zoo">London Zoo</a>, the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra Theatre</a> and the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king <a href="Cetshwayo%20kaMpande">Cetshwayo</a>, which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General <a href="Evelyn%20Wood%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Evelyn Wood</a>, the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">1879</a>. Knutsford held two more meetings with the "izinDuna", and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home.

In late March 1889, just as the "izinDuna" were about to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the amalgamation with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession from a number of London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.

In London, as the amalgamation was formalised, Rhodes and Cawston sought public members to sit on the board of their prospective chartered company. They recruited the <a href="James%20Hamilton%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Abercorn">Duke of Abercorn</a>, an affluent Irish peer and landowner with estates in <a href="County%20Donegal">Donegal</a> and Scotland, to chair the firm, and the <a href="Alexander%20Duff%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Fife">Earl of Fife</a>—soon to become the Duke of Fife, following his marriage to the daughter of the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a>—to act as his deputy. The third and final public member added to the board was the nephew and heir apparent of the erstwhile Cabinet minister <a href="Henry%20Grey%2C%203rd%20Earl%20Grey">Earl Grey</a>, <a href="Albert%20Grey">Albert Grey</a>, who was a staunch imperialist, already associated with southern Africa. Attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Salisbury, Rhodes then gave the position of standing counsel in the proposed company to the Prime Minister's son, <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cecil%20of%20Chelwood">Lord Robert Cecil</a>. <a href="Horace%20Farquhar%2C%201st%20Earl%20Farquhar">Horace Farquhar</a>, a prominent London financier and friend of the Prince of Wales, was added to the board at Fife's suggestion later in the year.

Rhodes spent the next few months in London, seeking out supporters for his cause in the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a>, the <a href="City%20of%20London">City</a> and, occasionally, the rural estates of the landed gentry. These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist <a href="Harry%20Johnston">Harry Johnston</a>, Alexander Livingstone Bruce (who sat on the board of the East Africa Company), and <a href="Alexander%20Bruce%2C%206th%20Lord%20Balfour%20of%20Burleigh">Lord Balfour of Burleigh</a>, among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889. The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity. Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently <a href="William%20Thomas%20Stead">William Thomas Stead</a>, editor of the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>", opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London.

Maguire, in London, promptly wrote to the Colonial Office, casting doubt on the letter's character on the grounds that it lacked the witnessing signature of an unbiased missionary. He concurrently wrote to Thompson, who was still in Bulawayo, to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter's drafting. Around the same time, Robinson's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with <a href="Henry%20Loch%2C%201st%20Baron%20Loch">Sir Henry Brougham Loch</a>. Rhodes claimed not to be worried, telling Shippard in a letter that "the policy will not be altered". Indeed, by the end of June 1889, despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula's letter rejecting the concession, Rhodes had got his way: Lord Salisbury's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa, coupled with Rhodes's personal exertions in London, prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter. Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889, while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company's establishment.
"My part is done," Rhodes wrote to Maund, soon after reaching Cape Town; "the charter is granted supporting Rudd Concession and granting us the interior ... We have the whole thing recognised by the Queen and even if eventually we had any difficulty with king [Lobengula] the Home people would now always recognise us in possession of the minerals[;] they quite understand that savage potentates frequently repudiate." A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, "whatever [Lobengula] does now will not affect the fact that when there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country". On 29 October 1889, nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a>, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.

Babayane and Mshete had arrived back in Bulawayo in August, accompanied by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, it is not so." But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that he would just have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly."

The charter incorporating the British South Africa Company committed it to remaining "British in character and domicile", and defined its area of operations extremely vaguely, mentioning only that it was empowered to operate north of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, and west of Mozambique. Northern and western bounds were not indicated. This was done deliberately to allow Rhodes to acquire as much land as he could without interference. The Company was made responsible for the safeguarding of peace and law in its territory, and licensed to do so "in such ways and manners as it shall consider necessary". It was vested with the power to raise its own police force, and charged with, among other things, abolishing slavery in all of its territories and restricting the sale of liquor to indigenous Africans. Local traditions were to be respected. The Company's charter was otherwise made extremely equivocal with the intention that this would allow it to operate freely and independently, and to <a href="Company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">govern and develop</a> its acquired territories while also turning a profit.

Rhodes capitalised the Company at £1,000,000, split into £1 shares, and used his other business interests to pump capital into it. Rhodes's diamond concern, De Beers, invested more than £200,000, while his gold firm, Gold Fields, put in nearly £100,000. He himself put in £45,000, along with another £11,000 jointly with Beit. Overall, about half of the Chartered Company's capital was held by its main actors, particularly Rhodes, Beit, Rudd and their confederates. During the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions over the coming years through what <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> describes as a ""<a href="%3Awiktionary%3Asuppressio%20veri">suppressio veri</a>" ... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions". Contrary to what Whitehall and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and others called the Central Search Association, which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the United Concessions Company in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised Knutsford to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.
Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890 on the back of widespread support among Cape <a href="Afrikaners">Afrikaners</a>. He announced that his first objective as premier was the occupation of the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. His Chartered Company had by this time raised the <a href="Pioneer%20Column">Pioneer Column</a>, a few hundred volunteers referred to as "pioneers" whose lot was to both occupy Mashonaland and begin its development. To this end its ranks were filled with men from all corners of southern African society, including, at Rhodes's insistence, several sons of the Cape's leading families. Each pioneer was promised of land and 15 mining claims in return for his service.

Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the expedition at the behest of his friend Jameson, much to the fury of many of the "izinDuna", who saw the column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter <a href="Frederick%20Selous">Frederick Courteney Selous</a>, and escorted by 500 <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Police">British South Africa Company's Police</a> under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather, the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from Bechuanaland and then north, and founded <a href="Tuli%2C%20Zimbabwe">Fort Tuli</a>, <a href="Masvingo">Fort Victoria</a> and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped at the site of the future capital, <a href="Harare">Fort Salisbury</a> (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> the next morning.

The administration of Mashonaland did not immediately prove profitable for the Company or its investors, partly because of the costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.

Edward Renny-Tailyour, representing the <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> businessman Eduard Lippert—an estranged cousin of Beit—had been attempting to gain a concession from Lobengula since early 1888. Rhodes saw Lippert's activities as unwelcome meddling and so repeatedly tried (and failed) to settle with him. In April 1891, Renny-Tailyour grandly announced that he and Lobengula had made an agreement: in return for £1,000 up front and £500 annually, the king would bestow on Lippert the exclusive rights to manage lands, establish banks, mint money, and conduct trade in the territory of the Chartered Company. The authenticity of this document was disputed, largely because the only witnesses to have signed it, apart from "inDuna" Mshete, were Renny-Tailyour's associates, one of whom soon attested that Lobengula had believed himself to be granting a concession to <a href="Theophilus%20Shepstone">Theophilus Shepstone</a>'s son, "Offy" Shepstone, with Lippert merely acting as an agent. The Lippert concession therefore had a number of potential defects, but Lippert was still confident he could extract a princely fee for it from the Chartered Company; he named his price as £250,000 in cash or shares at par.

Rhodes, backed by Loch, initially condemned the Lippert concession as a fraud and branded Lippert's locally based agents enemies of the peace. Loch assured Rhodes that if Lippert tried to gazette his agreement, he would issue a proclamation warning of its infringement on the Rudd Concession and the Company's charter, and threaten Lippert's associates with legal action. The Colonial Office agreed with Loch. Rhodes initially said that he would not pay Lippert's price, which he described as blackmail, but after conferring with Beit decided that refusing to buy out Lippert might lead to drawn-out and similarly expensive court proceedings, which they could not be sure of winning. Rhodes told Beit to start bargaining. Lippert's agreement turned out to be an unexpected blessing for Rhodes in that it included a concession on land rights from Lobengula, which the Chartered Company itself lacked, and needed if it were to be recognised by Whitehall as legally owning the occupied territory in Mashonaland. After two months and a number of breakdowns in talks, Rudd took over the negotiations. He and Lippert agreed on 12 September 1891 that the Company would take over the concession from Lippert on the condition that he returned to Bulawayo and had it more properly formalised by Lobengula; in return the Company would grant the German of his choice in Matabeleland (with full land and mineral rights), 30,000 shares in the Chartered Company and other financial incentives.

The success of this plan hinged on Lobengula continuing to believe that Lippert was acting against Rhodes rather than on his behalf. The religious Moffat was deeply troubled by what he called the "palpable immorality" of this deceit, but agreed not to interfere, deciding that Lobengula was just as untrustworthy as Lippert. With Moffat looking on as a witness, Lippert delivered his side of the deal in November 1891, extracting from the Matabele king the exclusive land rights for a century in the Chartered Company's operative territories, including permission to lay out farms and towns and to levy rents, in place of what had been agreed in April. As arranged, Lippert sold these rights to the Company, whereupon Loch approved the concession, expressing contentment at the solving of the Company's land rights problem; in an internal Whitehall memorandum, the Colonial Office affably remarked how expediently that administrative obstacle had been removed. The Matabele remained unaware of this subterfuge until May 1892.

Lobengula's weakened Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company settlements in Mashonaland and north of the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered by the lack of respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the <a href="Shashe%20River">Shashe</a> and <a href="Manyame%20River">Hunyani Rivers</a>, and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele "impis". After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893, Jameson, who Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland, unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an "indaba". Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had "come not only to dig the gold but to rob me of my people and country as well". Monitoring events from Cape Town, Rhodes gauged Jameson's readiness for war by telegraph: "Read Luke 14:31". Jameson wired back: "All right. Have read Luke 14:31".

On 13 August 1893, Lobengula refused to accept the stipend due him under the terms of the Rudd Concession, saying "it is the price of my blood". The next day, Jameson signed a secret agreement with settlers at Fort Victoria, promising each man of farm land, 20 gold claims and a share of Lobengula's cattle in return for service in a war against Matabeleland. Lobengula wrote again to Queen Victoria, and tried to send Mshete to England again at the head of another embassy, but Loch detained the "izinDuna" at Cape Town for a few days, then sent them home. Following a few minor skirmishes, the <a href="First%20Matabele%20War">First Matabele War</a> started in earnest in October: Company troops moved on Lobengula, using the inexorable firepower of their <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim machine gun</a>s to crush attacks by the far larger Matabele army. On 3 November, with the whites nearing Bulawayo, Lobengula torched the town and fled; the settlers began rebuilding atop the ruins the next day. Jameson sent troops north from Bulawayo to bring the king back, but this column ceased its pursuit in early December after the remnants of Lobengula's army ambushed and annihilated <a href="Shangani%20Patrol">34 troopers</a> who were sent across the <a href="Shangani%20River">Shangani River</a> ahead of the main force. Lobengula had escaped the Company, but he lived only another two months before dying from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in the north of the country on 22 or 23 January 1894.

Matabeleland was conquered. The Matabele "izinDuna" unanimously accepted peace with the Company at an "indaba" in late February 1894. Rhodes subsequently funded education for three of Lobengula's sons. The name applied to the Company's domain by many of its early settlers, "<a href="Rhodesia%20%28name%29">Rhodesia</a>", was made official by the Company in May 1895, and by Britain in 1898. The lands south of the Zambezi were designated "<a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>", while those to the north were divided into <a href="North-Western%20Rhodesia">North-Western</a> and <a href="North-Eastern%20Rhodesia">North-Eastern Rhodesia</a>, which merged to form <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> in 1911. During three decades under Company rule, railways, telegraph wires and roads were laid across the territories' previously bare landscape with great vigour, and, with the immigration of tens of thousands of white colonists, prominent mining and tobacco farming industries were created, albeit partly at the expense of the black population's traditional ways of life, which were varyingly disrupted by the introduction of Western-style infrastructure, government, religion and economics. Southern Rhodesia, which attracted most of the settlers and investment, was turning a profit by 1912; Northern Rhodesia, by contrast, annually lost the Company millions right up to the 1920s. Following the results of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20government%20referendum%2C%201922">government referendum of 1922</a>, Southern Rhodesia received <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> from Britain at the termination of the Company's charter in 1923, and became a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a>. Northern Rhodesia became a directly administered British protectorate the following year.

Renewable energy in Scotland

The production of renewable energy in Scotland is an issue that has come to the fore in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century. The natural resource base for <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> is extraordinary by <a href="Renewable%20energy%20in%20the%20European%20Union">European</a>, and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being <a href="wind%20power">wind</a>, <a href="wave%20power">wave</a>, and <a href="tidal%20power">tide</a>.

At the start of 2018, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> had 10.3 <a href="gigawatts">gigawatts</a> (GW) of installed renewable electricity capacity. Renewable electricity generation in Scotland was 24,936 GWh in 2017, making up 68% of gross electricity consumption. Scottish renewable generation makes up approximately 25% of total UK renewable generation (down from 32% in 2014). In 2014, Scotland exported over 24 per cent of generation.

In 2015, Scotland generated 59% of its electricity consumption through renewable sources, exceeding the country's goal of 50% renewable energy by 2015. Moving forward, the Scottish Government's energy plan calls for 100% of electricity consumption to be generated through renewable sources by 2020, and 50% of total energy consumption (including transportation) by 2030. 

Continuing improvements in engineering and economics are enabling more of the <a href="renewable%20resource">renewable resource</a>s to be utilised. Fears regarding <a href="peak%20oil">peak oil</a> and <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.

In addition to planned increases in large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce <a href="greenhouse%20gas">carbon emissions</a> are being researched. Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.

In addition to an existing installed capacity of 1.3 Gigawatts (GW) of <a href="hydroelectricity">hydro-electric</a> schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of <a href="wind%20power">wind</a> and 7.5 GW of <a href="tidal%20power">tidal power</a>, 25% of the estimated total capacity for the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and up to 14 GW of <a href="wave%20power">wave power</a> potential, 10% of EU capacity. The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW. Scotland exceeded its renewable energy target, set in 2007, for 31% of total power generation coming from renewables by 2011. Scotland eyes 50% renewable energy by 2030.

In January 2006 the total installed electrical generating capacity from all forms of renewable energy was less than 2 GW, about a fifth of the total <a href="Energy%20use%20and%20conservation%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">electrical production</a>. By January 2007 wind power capacity, which has been growing rapidly, reached 1 GW capacity, and the total for renewables had grown to over 2.3 GW. By August 2009 wind power capacity was a fraction short of 1.5 GW and total renewables capacity had reached over 3.1 GW. By mid-2011 these figures were 2.76 GW and 4.6 GW respectively.

In 2012, over 40% of Scotland's electricity came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40% of the UK's renewables output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 <a href="megawatts">megawatts</a> (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95% (1,005 MW) on the end of 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3% on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output. The bulk of electricity production is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland "et al." (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and <a href="Nuclear%20power%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">nuclear</a> (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that electricity production is only part of the overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 <a href="watt-hour">Terawatt-hours</a> (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised is from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).

The renewable energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, according to a 2013 study by <a href="Scottish%20Renewables">Scottish Renewables</a>. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for renewable energy. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector has the potential to grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of <a href="offshore%20wind%20power">offshore wind power</a> development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by <a href="bioenergy">bioenergy</a> systems in areas such as <a href="Lochaber">Lochaber</a>, <a href="Moray">Moray</a> and <a href="Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a>.

Scotland also has significant quantities of <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> deposits, including 62.4% of the EU's proven reserves of oil, 12.5% of the EU's proven reserves of gas and 69% of UK coal reserves. Nonetheless, the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a> has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020. In 2007 this was increased to 50% of electricity from renewables by 2020, with an interim target of 31% by 2011. The following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 Climate Change Delivery Plan. Maf Smith, director of the <a href="Sustainable%20Development%20Commission">Sustainable Development Commission</a> in Scotland said "Governments across the world are shying away from taking the necessary action. The Scottish Government must be commended for its intention to lead the way".

An important reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Environmental%20Pollution">Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution</a>'s proposal that <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy <a href="White%20Paper">White Paper</a>. The 2006 <a href="Stern%20Review">Stern Review</a> proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased the profile of the issue.

Scotland has 85% of the UK's <a href="hydroelectricity">hydro-electric</a> energy resource, much of it developed by the <a href="North%20of%20Scotland%20Hydro-Electric%20Board">North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board</a> in the 1950s. The "Hydro Board", which brought "power from the glens", was a nationalised industry at the time although it was <a href="privatised">privatised</a> in 1989 and is now part of <a href="Scottish%20and%20Southern%20Energy%20plc">Scottish and Southern Energy plc</a>.

Current capacity is 1.54 GW and includes major developments such as the 120 MW <a href="Breadalbane%20hydro-electric%20power%20scheme">Breadalbane scheme</a> and the 245 MW <a href="Tummel%20hydro-electric%20power%20scheme">Tummel</a> system. Several of Scotland's hydro-electric plants were built to power the <a href="aluminium%20smelting">aluminium smelting</a> industry. These were built in several "schemes" of linked stations, each covering a <a href="drainage%20basin">catchment area</a>, whereby the same water may generate power several times as it descends. Numerous remote <a href="strath">strath</a>s were flooded by these schemes, many of the largest of which involved tunnelling through mountains as well as damming rivers. Emma Wood, the author of a study of these pioneers wrote:

I heard about drowned farms and hamlets, the ruination of the salmon-fishing and how <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a> might be washed away if the dams failed inland. I was told about the huge veins of crystal they found when they were tunnelling deep under the mountains.
It is estimated that as much as another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in <a href="Knoydart">Knoydart</a> and a system planned for <a href="Kingussie">Kingussie</a>. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited it is unlikely that the full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW <a href="Glendoe%20Hydro%20Scheme">Glendoe Project</a> which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new <a href="pumped-storage%20hydroelectricity">pumped storage</a> schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW <a href="Cruachan%20Dam">Cruachan Dam</a> and 300 MW <a href="Falls%20of%20Foyers">Falls of Foyers</a> schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.

Wind power in Scotland is the country's fastest growing <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> technology, with 5587 <a href="megawatt">MW</a> of installed capacity as of 2015. The <a href="Robin%20Rigg%20Wind%20Farm">Robin Rigg Wind Farm</a> is a 180 MW development completed in April 2010, which is Scotland's first <a href="offshore%20wind%20farm">offshore wind farm</a>, sited on a sandbank in the <a href="Solway%20Firth">Solway Firth</a>.
The United Kingdom's largest onshore <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a> (539 MW) is at <a href="Whitelee%20Wind%20Farm">Whitelee</a> in <a href="East%20Renfrewshire">East Renfrewshire</a>. The <a href="Clyde%20Wind%20Farm">Clyde Wind Farm</a> is a 548 MW <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a> under construction near <a href="Abington%2C%20South%20Lanarkshire">Abington, South Lanarkshire</a>, Scotland, which will be Europe's largest onshore wind farm when completed. Two very large offshore <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s (5 MW each) are located in the <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a>. There are many other large onshore <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a>s including some, both planned and operating, which are in <a href="Community%20wind%20energy">community ownership</a>.

The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have generally shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland. Wind farm developers sometimes offer "community benefit funds" to help address any disadvantages faced by those living adjacent to wind farms. There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore given the high average wind speeds, and a number of large offshore wind farms are planned.

It is estimated that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential is estimated at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a> and <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown Estate</a> as part of a UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and <a href="Statoil">Statoil</a> of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off <a href="Fraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a>. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.

Figures from Weather Energy, part of a wider European project, show electricity generated by wind in November 2018 was enough to power nearly 6 million homes – a new record for Scotland. In another milestone, wind production outstripped total electricity demand on 20 out of 30 days. Wind output has broken through the 100% threshold for the first time with 109% of total electricity demand being met from renewables, according to new data.

Various systems are under development at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for <a href="wave%20power">wave power</a> off Scotland's coasts. Pelamis Wave Power (previously Ocean Power Delivery) are an <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-based company whose <a href="Pelamis%20wave%20energy%20converter">Pelamis</a> system has been tested off <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. Their second generation P2 Pelamis machines are long and diameter. Five tubes joined together by hinged joints float semi-submerged on the surface of the ocean and move relative to each other as waves pass down the length of the machine. This motion is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which drive generators inside the machine to produce electricity. Future wave farm projects around Scotland could involve an arrangement of interlinked 1 MW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable.

Another approach was used by the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of <a href="Islay">Islay</a> by <a href="Wavegen">Wavegen Ltd</a>. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250 kW generators. <a href="Islay%20LIMPET">Islay LIMPET</a> was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.

Funding for the UK's first <a href="wave%20farm">wave farm</a> was announced by the then <a href="Scottish%20Executive">Scottish Executive</a> on 22 February 2007. It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines at a cost of over £4 million. The funding is part of a new £13 million funding package for marine power projects in Scotland that will also support developments to Aquamarine's Oyster and <a href="Ocean%20Power%20Technologies">Ocean Power Technologies</a>' <a href="PowerBuoy">PowerBuoy</a> wave systems, AWS Ocean Energy's sub-sea wave devices, ScotRenewables' 1.2 MW floating rotor device, Cleantechcom's tidal surge plans for the Churchill barriers between various Orkney islands, the Open Hydro tidal ring turbines, and further developments to the Wavegen system proposed for <a href="Isle%20of%20Lewis">Lewis</a> as well as a further £2.5 million for the <a href="European%20Marine%20Energy%20Centre">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (EMEC) based in Orkney. This is a Scottish Executive-backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of <a href="Eday">Eday</a>. At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as "the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility."

The <a href="Siadar%20Wave%20Energy%20Project">Siadar Wave Energy Project</a> was announced in 2009. This 4 MW system was planned by <a href="npower%20Renewables">npower Renewables</a> and <a href="Wavegen">Wavegen</a> for a site 400 metres off the shore of Siadar Bay, in <a href="Isle%20of%20Lewis">Lewis</a>. However, in July 2011 holding company <a href="RWE">RWE</a> announced they were withdrawing from the scheme, and Wavegen are seeking new partners. In early 2010 two areas were identified for substantial offshore wind development, in the Moray Firth basin and outer Firth of Forth. Shortly afterwards the Government earmarked eleven sites they expected to benefit from the construction of up to 8,000 offshore turbines by 2020. These included <a href="Campbeltown">Campbeltown</a> and <a href="Hunterston">Hunterston</a>, four sites previously used for offshore oil fabrication at <a href="Ardersier">Ardersier</a>, <a href="Nigg%20Bay">Nigg Bay</a>, <a href="Stornoway">Arnish</a> and <a href="Kishorn">Kishorn</a> and five east coast locations from <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a> to <a href="Leith">Leith</a>. In May 2010 the "Vagr Atferd P2" Pelamis 750 kW system was launched for testing by EMEC. The device weighs and is long.

Unlike wind and wave, <a href="tidal%20power">tidal power</a> is an inherently predictable source. However the technology is in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today it is known that a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a <a href="turbine">turbine</a>. <a href="Tidal%20stream%20power">Tidal stream power</a> captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2 MW device at <a href="Strangford%20Lough">Strangford Lough</a> in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed <a href="tidal%20power">tidal power</a> plants of notable size are the <a href="Sihwa%20Lake%20Tidal%20Power%20Station">Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station</a> in <a href="Gyeonggi%20Province">Gyeonggi Province</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and the <a href="Rance%20Tidal%20Power%20Station">Rance Tidal Power Station</a> in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.

The <a href="Pentland%20Firth">Pentland Firth</a> between Orkney and mainland Scotland has been described as the "<a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> of tidal power" and may be capable of generating up to 10 GW although a more recent estimate suggests an upper limit of 1.9 GW. In March 2010 a total of ten sites in the area, capable of providing an installed capacity of 1.2 GW of tidal and wave generation were leased out by the Crown Estate. Several other tidal sites with considerable potential exist in the Orkney archipelago. Tidal races on the west coast at Kylerhea between <a href="Skye">Skye</a> and <a href="Loch%20Alsh">Lochalsh</a>, the Grey Dog north of <a href="Scarba">Scarba</a>, the Dorus Mòr off <a href="Crinan%2C%20Argyll%20and%20Bute">Crinan</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corryvreckan">Gulf of Corryvreckan</a> also offer significant prospects.

In August 2010 the Atlantis Resources Corporation's AK-1000 turbine, which has blades was unveiled at <a href="Invergordon">Invergordon</a>. It is claimed to be the largest tidal turbine ever built and will be tested by EMEC off Eday. In October 2010 <a href="MeyGen">MeyGen</a>, a consortium of <a href="Morgan%20Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a>, Atlantis Resources Corporation and <a href="International%20Power">International Power</a>, received a 25-year operational lease from the Crown Estate for a 400 MW <a href="tidal%20power">tidal power</a> project in the <a href="Pentland%20Firth">Pentland Firth</a>. However, in 2011 the plans were in difficulty after Norwegian partners <a href="Statkraft">Statkraft</a> pulled out of the project. In December 2014, Atlantis announced that onshore construction at the project site for connection to the electricity transmission grid would commence in January 2015. The MeyGen project began exporting power to the national grid in November 2016.

In 2010 it was announced that 10 Hammerfest Strom HS1000 Norwegian turbines, capable of generating 1 MW each, could be installed in the <a href="Sound%20of%20Islay">Sound of Islay</a> and that the BiFab yard at Arnish had won a £2 million contract to build some of the structures' components. The following March this project, which will become the largest tidal array in the world, was approved by the Scottish Government with 10 planned tidal turbines predicted to generate enough power for over 5,000 homes. The Sound of Islay offers both high currents and shelter from storms. A single 1 MW HS1000 was installed at EMEC off Eday, Orkney by the end of 2011.

The "world's first community-owned tidal power generator" became operational in <a href="Bluemull%20Sound">Bluemull Sound</a> off Yell, Shetland in early 2014. This 30 kW Nova Innovation device feeds into the local grid, and a 100kW tidal turbine was connected in August 2016. At the opposite end of the country a 2010 consultants' report into the possibility of a scheme involving the construction of a Solway Barrage, possibly south of <a href="Annan%2C%20Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Annan</a>, concluded that the plans "would be expensive and environmentally sensitive." In 2013 an alternative scheme using the VerdErg Renewable Energy spectral marine energy converter was proposed for a plan involving the use of a bridge along the route of an abandoned railway line between Annan and <a href="Bowness-on-Solway">Bowness-on-Solway</a>.

Various <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a> schemes exist at present, and as with most renewables, interest is growing in the subject. Westray Development Trust operate a biodiesel vehicle fuelled by the residual vegetable oils from the Orkney archipelago <a href="fish%20and%20chips">fish and chip</a> outlets. On a larger scale Argent Energy's plant in <a href="Motherwell%2C%20North%20Lanarkshire">Motherwell</a> recycles <a href="tallow">tallow</a> and used cooking oil to produce of biodiesel per annum.

A major benefit of biodiesel is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels is a matter of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the <a href="Directive%20on%20the%20Promotion%20of%20the%20use%20of%20biofuels%20and%20other%20renewable%20fuels%20for%20transport">European biofuels directive</a> intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised on the grounds that they may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.

Due to the relatively short growing season for <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar producing crops</a>, <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops to be used to this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.

<a href="Biogas">Biogas</a>, or <a href="landfill%20gas">landfill gas</a>, is a biofuel produced through the intermediary stage of <a href="anaerobic%20digestion">anaerobic digestion</a> consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced <a href="methane">methane</a> and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in <a href="Stornoway">Stornoway</a> in the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a>. The <a href="Scottish%20Environment%20Protection%20Agency">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also leading the way towards the establishment of a <a href="digestate">digestate</a> standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and <a href="mechanical%20biological%20treatment">mechanical biological treatment</a> facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as <a href="Westray">Westray</a>.

It has been recognised that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites have the potential for a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the <a href="Avondale%20Landfill">Avondale Landfill</a> in Falkirk already utilising their potential.

A 2007 report concluded that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind as the largest potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast to be able to provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 <a href="Forestry%20Commission">Forestry Commission</a> and Scottish government follow-up report concluded that: "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at <a href="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a> using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>7.5 million grant, later increased to <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>10.5 million, to support biomass energy. <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.

There is also local potential for <a href="energy%20crop">energy crop</a>s such as short-rotation willow or poplar <a href="Coppicing">coppice</a>, <a href="Miscanthus%20giganteus">miscanthus energy grass</a>, agricultural wastes such as straw and manure, and forestry residues. These crops could provide 0.8 GW of generating capacity.

The Energy Savings Trust has estimated that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although only a fraction of this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Chisholm">Malcolm Chisholm</a> launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical <a href="storage%20heater">storage heater</a>s directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.

<a href="Whisky">Whisky</a> <a href="Distilled%20beverage">distilleries</a> may have a locally important part to play. Caithness Heat and Power have announced plans to tackle <a href="fuel%20poverty">fuel poverty</a> in <a href="Wick%2C%20Highland">Wick</a> by utilising a wood chip <a href="Cogeneration">CHP</a> scheme in partnership with the Old Pulteney Distillery. On the island of Islay, a swimming pool is heated using waste heat from the <a href="Bowmore%20Single%20Malt">Bowmore</a> distillery. In Edinburgh, Tynecastle High School, due to be completed in 2010, will be heated by waste heat from the neighbouring North British Distillery. In 2009 the <a href="Diageo">Diageo</a> <a href="Cameron%20Bridge">Cameron Bridge</a> distillery announced plans for a £65 million facility to generate energy from the spent "wash" created in the manufacturing process, which will aim to replace 95% of the plan's existing fossil fuel use.

There are also a growing number of <a href="micro%20hydro">micro hydro</a> systems on smaller watercourses, especially in more remote rural locations.

The <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> island <a href="Eigg">Eigg</a> is not connected to the <a href="National%20Grid%20%28Great%20Britain%29">National Grid</a>, and has an <a href="virtual%20power%20plant">integrated renewable power supply</a> with wind, hydro and solar and battery storage, and diesel backup (which is rarely used).

Despite Scotland's relatively low level of sunshine hours, <a href="Solar%20hot%20water%20panel">solar thermal panels</a> can work effectively as they are capable of producing hot water even in cloudy weather. The technology was developed in the 1970s and is well-established with various installers in place, although AES Solar based in <a href="Forres">Forres</a> (who provided the panels for the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20building">Scottish Parliament building</a>) are Scotland's only manufacturer.

Since the introduction of <a href="Feed-in%20tariffs%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">feed-in tariffs</a> there has been a growth in the volume of installed <a href="solar%20cell">photovoltaic</a> panels, which generate electricity. In 2004, the largest installation in Scotland was a 21 kWp system at the Sir E. Scott secondary school in Tarbert, <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a> although larger systems have been completed since then. The UK's practicable resource is estimated at 7.2 TWh per annum, which in the Scottish context is the approximate equivalent of 70 MW or less of installed capacity.

The "road energy system" uses water pipes buried beneath a layer of <a href="Asphalt%20concrete">tarmac</a>. In the summer, the dark asphalt is heated by the sun which in turn heats the water in the pipes. This water can be stored in an underground aquifer and the heat extracted in winter using a heat pump. The system can be used to warm or cool down roads, keeping them ice-free and/or preventing softening due to overheating. Alternatively, the stored energy can be used for cooling buildings. The system was developed in the Netherlands and has been licensed by <a href="Ullapool">Ullapool</a>-based Invisible Energy Systems, who have installed the technology in their car park.

<a href="Geothermal%20energy">Geothermal energy</a> is obtained by tapping the heat of the earth itself. Most systems in Scotland provide heating through a ground source <a href="heat%20pump">heat pump</a> which brings energy to the surface via shallow pipe works. An example is the Glenalmond Street project in <a href="Shettleston">Shettleston</a>, which uses a combination of solar and geothermal energy to heat 16 houses. Water in a coal mine below ground level is heated by geothermal energy and maintained at a temperature of about 12 <a href="Celsius">°C</a> (54 <a href="Fahrenheit">°F</a>) throughout the year. The warmed water is raised and passed through a heat pump, boosting the temperature to 55 °C (131 °F), and is then distributed to the houses providing heating to radiators.

Although the pumps may not be powered from renewable sources, up to four times the energy used can be recovered. Installation costs can vary from £7,000 to £10,000, and grants may be available from the Scottish Community and Householders Renewables Initiative operated by <a href="Community%20Energy%20Scotland">Community Energy Scotland</a> for domestic properties up to a maximum of £4,000. Perhaps up to 7.6 TWh of energy is available on an annual basis from this source.

There is also potential for geothermal energy production from decommissioned oil and gas fields.

It is clear that if carbon emissions are to be reduced, a combination of increased production from renewables and decreased consumption of energy in general and fossil fuels in particular will be required. On the latter front, <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, the then UK <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, announced in November 2006 that within a decade all new houses would have to be '<a href="zero%20energy%20building">zero carbon'</a>. A variety of other options exist, most of which may affect development of renewable technologies even if they are not means of producing energy from renewable sources themselves.

Various other ideas for renewable energy in the early stages of development, such as <a href="ocean%20thermal%20energy%20conversion">ocean thermal energy conversion</a>, <a href="deep%20lake%20water%20cooling">deep lake water cooling</a>, and <a href="blue%20energy">blue energy</a>, have received little attention in Scotland, presumably because the potential is so significant for less speculative technologies.

<a href="Carbon%20offset">Carbon offset</a>ting involves individuals or organisations compensating for their use of fossil fuels by making payments to projects that aim to neutralise the effect of these carbon emissions. Although the idea has become fashionable, the theory has received serious criticism of late.

Nonetheless, a credible option may be to plant trees within the local bioregion and maintain the forest on a permanent basis, thus locking up carbon produced by burning fossil fuels. In British growing conditions this method can compensate for carbon at a rate of 200 <a href="Metric%20ton">tonnes</a> per square kilometre (0.89 <a href="Short%20ton">tons</a>/acre) planted over a 100-year period. Thus a plantation could uptake 200 tonnes (220 tons) of carbon over twenty-five years. This is the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes (11,000 short tons) of carbon dioxide. The weaknesses of the approach include uncertainty as to whether the planting might have occurred anyway and who, in the future, will ensure permanence. However, there is likely to be a greater level of credibility inherent in a nearby and visible scheme than in a far-distant one.

The following technologies are means of reducing the effect of carbon emissions and form an important aspect of the energy debate in Scotland and are included here for completeness. Their effect is likely to influence the future direction of commercial renewable energy, but they are not renewable forms of energy production themselves.

Carbon sequestration: Also known as <a href="carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon capture and storage</a>, this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide (CO) that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields. It is not a form of renewable energy production, but it may be a way to significantly reduce the effect of fossil fuels whilst renewables are commercialised. It may also be an intermediate step towards a 'hydrogen economy' (see below), which could either enable further renewable development or conceivably out-compete it. The technology has been successfully pioneered in <a href="Norway">Norway</a> but is still a relatively untried concept.

'Clean coal' technology: It has been estimated that it will be 2020 to 2025 before any commercial-scale clean coal power stations (coal-burning power stations with carbon capture and sequestration) are widely adopted. Moreover, some have criticised the clean coal approach and it is at best a means of ameliorating carbon emissions. It is not a form of renewable energy production, although like carbon sequestration it offers a significant commercial challenge to renewable developments. In 2009 a licence to test underground coal gassification technology in Fife was granted to Thornton New Energy. However, a plan to build a new "clean coal" power station at <a href="Hunterston">Hunterston</a> collapsed in 2009 after financial backing was withdrawn.

Nuclear power: Renewable energy as a concept generally excludes <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> although this stance has been challenged.

Incineration: There is a successful <a href="waste-to-energy">waste-to-energy</a> <a href="incineration">incineration</a> plant at <a href="Lerwick">Lerwick</a> in Shetland which burns 22,000 tonnes (24,250 tons) of waste every year and provides district heating to over 600 customers. Although such plants generate carbon emissions through the combustion of the biological material and plastic wastes (which derive from fossil fuels), they also reduce the damage done to the atmosphere from the creation of <a href="methane">methane</a> in landfill sites. This is a much more damaging greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide the burning process produces, although other systems which do not involve district heating may have a similar carbon footprint to straightforward landfill degradation.

Although <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> offers significant potential as an alternative to hydrocarbons as a carrier of energy, neither hydrogen itself nor the associated <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a> technologies are sources of energy in themselves. Nevertheless, the combination of renewable technologies and hydrogen is of considerable interest to those seeking <a href="alternative%20energy">alternatives to fossil fuels</a>. There are a number of Scottish projects involved in this research, supported by the Scottish Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Association (SHFCA).

The PURE project on <a href="Unst">Unst</a> in Shetland is a ground-breaking training and research centre which uses a combination of the ample supplies of wind power and fuel cells to create a <a href="Wind-Hydrogen%20Hybrid%20Power%20Systems">wind hydrogen</a> system. Two 15 kW turbines are attached to a 'Hypod' fuel cell, which in turn provides power for heating systems, the creation of stored liquid hydrogen and an innovative fuel-cell driven car. The project is community-owned and part of the Unst Partnership, the community's <a href="development%20trust">development trust</a>.

In the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a> a plan to enable a £10 million waste management plant into a hydrogen production facility was announced in June 2006. The Council have also agreed to purchase hydrogen-fuelled buses and hope the new plant, which will be constructed in partnership with the local Hydrogen Research Laboratory, will supply island filling stations and houses and the industrial park at Arnish.

ITI Energy was a division of <a href="ITI%20Scotland">ITI Scotland</a> and was established with the aim of funding Research and Development programmes in the energy sector. It is a division of ITI Scotland, which also includes a life sciences and digital media division. ITI Energy attracted the Alterg project, a French company that is developing technology for the cost-effective storage of hydrogen.

In July 2008 the SHFCA announced plans for a "hydrogen corridor" from Aberdeen to Peterhead. The proposal involves running hydrogen powered buses along the <a href="A90%20road">A 90</a> and is supported by <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a> Council and the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a>. The economics and practical application of hydrogen vehicles are being investigated by the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> in England. The City of Aberdeen has since purchased 20 fuel cell buses from <a href="Ballard%20Power%20Systems">Ballard</a>.

The "Hydrogen Office" in <a href="Methil%2C%20Fife">Methil</a> aims to demonstrate the benefits of improved energy efficiency and renewable and hydrogen energy systems.

A significant feature of Scotland's renewable potential is that the resources are largely distant from the main centres of population. This is by no means coincidental. The power of wind, wave and tide on the north and west coasts and for hydro in the mountains makes for dramatic scenery, but sometimes harsh living conditions. In 1966, <a href="W.%20H.%20Murray">W. H. Murray</a> described the <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a> as "the Isles on the Edge of the Sea where men are welcome—if they are hard in body and in spirit tenacious."

This happenstance of geography and climate has created various tensions. There is clearly a significant difference between a renewable energy production facility of modest size providing an island community with all its energy needs, and an industrial scale power station in the same location that is designed to export power to far distant urban locations. Thus, plans for one of the world's largest onshore windfarms on the Hebridean island of Lewis have generated considerable debate. A related issue is the <a href="Energy_policy_of_Scotland%23Beauly-Denny_power_line">high-voltage Beauly–Denny power line</a> which brings electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south. The matter went to a <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> and has been described by Ian Johnston of "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" as a "battle that pitches environmentalists against conservationists and giant energy companies against aristocratic landowners and <a href="clan">clan</a> chiefs". In January 2010 <a href="Jim%20Mather">Jim Mather</a>, the Energy Minister, announced that the project would be going ahead, notwithstanding the more than 18,000 objections received. 53km of the 132kV line inside the park was taken down and not replaced. The <a href="Beauly">Beauly</a>–<a href="Denny%2C%20Falkirk">Denny</a> line was energized by Christmas 2015.

There is considerable support for community-scale energy projects. For example, Alex Salmond, (ex)<a href="First%20Minister%20of%20Scotland">First Minister of Scotland</a>, has stated that "we can think big by delivering small" and aspires to have a "million Scottish households with access to their own or community renewable generation within ten years". The <a href="John%20Muir%20Trust">John Muir Trust</a> has also stated that "the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them", although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial.

A related issue is the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It has been alleged that UK transmission pricing structures are weighted against the development of renewables in Scotland, a debate which highlights the contrast between the sparsely populated north of Scotland and the highly urbanised south and east of England. Although the <a href="ecological%20footprint">ecological footprint</a>s of Scotland and England are similar the relationship between this footprint and the <a href="carrying%20capacity">biocapacities</a> of the respective countries are not. Scotland's biocapacity (a measure of the biologically productive area) is 4.52 <a href="global%20hectare">global hectare</a>s (gha) per head, some 15% less than the current ecological effect. In other words, with a 15% reduction in consumption, the Scottish population could live within the productive capacity of the land to support them. However, the UK ecological footprint is more than three times the biocapacity, which is only 1.6 gha head, amongst the lowest in Europe. Thus, to achieve the same end in the UK context, consumption would have to be reduced by about 66%.

The <a href="developed%20country">developed world's</a> economy is very dependent on inexpensive 'point-source' fossil fuels. Scotland, as a relatively sparsely populated country with significant renewable resources, is in a unique position to demonstrate how the transition to a low-carbon, widely distributed energy economy may be undertaken. A balance will need to be struck between supporting this transition and providing exports to the economies of densely populated regions in the <a href="Central%20Belt">Central Belt</a> and elsewhere, as they seek their own solutions. The tension between local and national needs in the Scottish context may therefore also play out on the wider UK and European stage.

Growing national concerns regarding <a href="peak%20oil">peak oil</a> and climate change have driven the subject of renewable energy high up the political agenda. Various public bodies and public-private partnerships have been created to develop the potential. The <a href="Forum%20for%20Renewable%20Energy%20Development%20in%20Scotland">Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland</a>, (FREDS) is a partnership between industry, academia and Government aimed at enabling Scotland to capitalise on its renewable energy resource. The Scottish Renewables Forum is an important intermediary organisation for the industry, hosting the annual "Green Energy Awards". <a href="Community%20Energy%20Scotland">Community Energy Scotland</a> provides advice, funding and finance for renewable energy projects developed by community groups. Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) is a public-private partnership created to identify and promote renewable energy opportunities for businesses in the north-east. In 2009 AREG formed an alliance with North Scotland Industries Group to help promote the North of Scotland as an "international renewable energy hub".

The Forestry Commission is active in promoting the biomass potential. The Climate Change Business Delivery Group aims to act as a way for businesses to share best practice and address the climate change challenge. Numerous universities are playing a role in supporting energy research under the Supergen programme, including <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a> research at <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>, marine technologies at <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, distributed power systems at <a href="University%20of%20Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> and biomass crops at the <a href="UHI%20Millennium%20Institute">UHI Millennium Institute</a>'s <a href="Orkney%20College">Orkney College</a>.

In 2010 the "<a href="Scotcampus">Scotcampus</a>" student Freshers' Festivals held in Edinburgh and Glasgow were powered entirely by renewable energy in a bid to raise awareness among young people in Scotland.

New data appears on a regular basis and milestones in 2007–14 include the following.

In February 2007 the commissioning of the <a href="Braes%20of%20Doune">Braes of Doune</a> wind farm took the UK renewables installed capacity up to 2 GW. Total Scottish capacity in October 2007 was 1.13 GW from 760 turbines, and increased to 1.3 GW by September 2008, and 1.48 GW by August 2009.

Also during 2007 Scottish and Southern Energy plc in conjunction with the <a href="University%20of%20Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde</a> began the implementation of a 'Regional Power Zone' in the Orkney archipelago. This ground-breaking scheme (that may be the first of its kind in the world) involves 'active network management' that will make better use of the existing infrastructure and allow a further 15 MW of new 'non-firm generation' output from renewables onto the network. Heat and Power Ltd. of Westray are involved in developing an innovative digestor system that is being trialled at Tuquoy farm. Designed by Sam Harcus and Colin Risbridger, it is capable of handling up to 1,500 tonnes of feedstock per annum. Scottish & Southern Energy have been asked to provide for an export capacity of 40 kWe. The aim is to help move the farm towards being powered by <a href="100%25%20renewable%20energy">100% renewable energy</a>.

In January 2008 it was reported that Professor Graeme Walker of the <a href="University%20of%20Abertay">University of Abertay</a> is leading a project aimed at using grain that is a by-product of whisky distilling as a biofuel. In February 2008 plans to build a 10 MW prototype tidal energy plant in the Pentland Firth were announced by Tocardo Tidal Energy Ltd. of Wick. Production was expected to commence in 2009. The following September, Scottish Power announced plans for two tidal projects in the same area, pending successful tests of a £6 million prototype.

In January 2009 the government announced the launch of a "Marine Spatial Plan" to map the potential of the Pentland Firth and Orkney coasts and agreed to take part in a working group examining options for an offshore grid to connect renewable energy projects in the North Sea to on-shore national grids. The potential for such a scheme has been described as including acting as a "30 GW battery for Europe's clean energy".

In July 2009 <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20Earth">Friends of the Earth</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a>, <a href="World%20Development%20Movement">World Development Movement</a> and <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> published a study called "The Power of Scotland Renewed." This study claimed that the country could meet all its electricity needs by 2030 without the requirement for either nuclear or fossil fuel powered installations.

In April 2010 permission was granted for four new hydro schemes totalling 6.7 MW capacity in the <a href="Loch%20Lomond%20and%20The%20Trossachs%20National%20Park">Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park</a>.

Sea Energy Renewables Ltd was purchased by Spanish company <a href="Repsol%20YPF">Repsol</a> in June 2010. This move paved the way for the Inch Cape 180 wind turbine project offshore from <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, scheduled for a 2018 completion. Work is not expected to start before 2015.

In 2013, a YouGov energy survey concluded that:

New YouGov research for Scottish Renewables shows Scots are twice as likely to favour wind power over nuclear or shale gas. Over six in ten (62%) people in Scotland say they would support large scale wind projects in their local area, more than double the number who said they would be generally for shale gas (24%) and almost twice as much as nuclear (32%). Hydro power is the most popular energy source for large scale projects in Scotland, with an overwhelming majority (80%) being in favour.
In August 2013 Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution connected a 2 MW <a href="lithium-ion%20battery">lithium-ion battery</a> at <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> Power Station. This was the UK's first large scale battery connected to a local electricity distribution network.

In September 2013 the Scottish Government granted permission for the commencement of the "largest tidal energy project in Europe". MeyGen intends to install a 9 MW demonstration turbine and then an 86 MW array tidal array in the Pentland Firth, with expected completion in 2020.

In July 2014 the Crown Estate gave approval to four new demonstration wave and tidal sites at the <a href="Stronsay">Stronsay Firth</a>, the <a href="Mull%20of%20Galloway">Mull of Galloway</a>, Islay and Harris.

Table notes

a. Note on 'installed capacity' and 'potential energy'. The former is an estimate of the maximum productive output of a given technology or individual generation station at a single point in time. The latter takes into account the likely intermittency of energy supply and is a measure of output over a period of time. Thus, for example, individual wind turbines may have a 'capacity factor' of between 15% and 45% depending on their location, with a higher capacity factor giving a greater potential energy output for a given installed capacity. The 'potential energy' column is thus an estimate based on a variety of assumptions including the installed capacity. Although 'potential energy' is in some ways a more useful method of comparing the current output and future potential of different technologies, using it would require cumbersome explanations of all the assumptions involved in each example, so installed capacity figures are generally used.

Air raids on Japan

<a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> forces conducted many air raids on Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During the first years of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> these attacks were limited to the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a> in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> from mid-1943. <a href="Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II">Strategic bombing</a> raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based <a href="Tactical%20bombing">tactical air units</a> also attacked Japan during 1945.

The <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States military</a> air campaign waged against Japan began in earnest in mid-1944 and intensified during the war's last months. While plans for attacks on Japan had been prepared prior to the Pacific War, these could not begin until the long-range <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> bomber was ready for combat. From June 1944 until January 1945, B-29s stationed in India staged through bases in China to make a series of nine raids on targets in western Japan, but this effort proved ineffective. The strategic bombing campaign was greatly expanded from November 1944 when bases in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> became available as a result of the <a href="Mariana%20and%20Palau%20Islands%20campaign">Mariana Islands Campaign</a>. These attacks initially attempted to target industrial facilities using high-altitude daylight "precision" bombing, which was also largely ineffective. From February 1945, the bombers switched to low-altitude night firebombing against urban areas as much of the manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes: this approach resulted in large-scale urban damage. Aircraft flying from Allied <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a> also frequently struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">planned invasion of Japan</a> scheduled for October 1945. During early August 1945, the cities of <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> and <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> were <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">struck and mostly destroyed by atomic bombs</a>.

Japan's military and <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a>s were unable to stop the Allied attacks. The number of <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> and <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, and most of these aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, and a lack of coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to <a href="firebombing">firebombing</a> attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few <a href="Air-raid%20shelter">air raid shelters</a> were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.

The Allied bombing campaign was one of the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">decision to surrender</a> in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.

The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> (which was subsumed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) in February 1942) began developing contingency plans for an air campaign against Japan during 1940. During that year the naval attaché to the <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Tokyo">Embassy of the United States in Tokyo</a> reported that Japan's <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a>s were weak, and proposals were made for American aircrew to volunteer for service with Chinese forces in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. The first <a href="American%20Volunteer%20Group">American Volunteer Group</a> (the "<a href="Flying%20Tigers">Flying Tigers</a>") began operations as part of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20Air%20Force">Republic of China Air Force</a> (ROCAF) in late 1941 using <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Warhawk</a> fighter aircraft. A second American Volunteer Group was also formed in late 1941 to attack Japan from bases in China using <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Hudson</a> and <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">A-20 Havoc</a> medium bombers. The <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941 led to open hostilities between the US and Japan and ended the need for covert operations, however, and this unit did not become active. The small number of Second Air Volunteer Group personnel who were dispatched from the United States in November 1941 were diverted to Australia upon the outbreak of war.

Japanese successes during the opening months of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> nullified pre-war US plans for attacks against the Japanese homeland and a series of attempts to start a small-scale campaign from bases in China were unsuccessful. Before the outbreak of war, the USAAF had planned to bomb Japan from <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and coastal areas in China. However, these areas were rapidly captured by Japanese forces, and the USAAF heavy bomber force in the Philippines was largely destroyed when <a href="Clark%20Air%20Base">Clark Air Base</a> was attacked on 8 December 1941. The USAAF subsequently attempted to send thirteen heavy bombers to China in March and April 1942 to attack the <a href="Japanese%20archipelago">Japanese home islands</a>. These aircraft reached India, but remained there as the <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">Japanese conquest of Burma</a> caused logistics problems and Chinese Nationalist leader <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> was reluctant to allow them to operate from territory under his control. A further 13 <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers were dispatched from the United States to operate from China in May 1942 as the <a href="HALPRO">HALPRO</a> force, but were re-tasked to support Allied operations in the Mediterranean. In July 1942, the commander of the American Volunteer Group, Colonel <a href="Claire%20Lee%20Chennault">Claire Lee Chennault</a>, sought a force of 100 <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47 Thunderbolt</a> fighters and 30 <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers, which he believed would be sufficient to "destroy" the Japanese aircraft industry. Three months later Chennault told United States President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> that a force of 105 modern fighters and 40 bombers (including twelve heavy bombers) would be able to "accomplish the downfall of Japan" within six to twelve months. The USAAF's headquarters did not regard these claims as credible, and Chennault's requests for reinforcements were not granted.

The Japanese government's pre-war plans to protect the country from air attack focused on neutralizing enemy air bases. Before the war it was believed that <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> aircraft based in the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> posed the greatest threat. The Japanese military planned to destroy the air bases within range of the home islands if Japan and the Soviet Union ever went to war. When the Pacific War began, the Japanese government believed that the best way to prevent American air raids was to capture and hold the areas in China and the Pacific from which such attacks could be launched. It was expected that the Allies would not be able to re-capture these bases. However, the Japanese anticipated that the Allies might still make small-scale attacks against the home islands using naval aircraft flying from <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s. The government chose not to develop strong defenses to meet the threat of air attack as the country's industrial resources were unable to maintain offensive air forces in China and the Pacific as well as a defensive force in the home islands.

Few air units or anti-aircraft batteries were stationed in the home islands during the early months of the Pacific War. The <a href="General%20Defense%20Command">General Defense Command</a> (GDC) had been formed in July 1941 to oversee the defense of the home islands, but all combat units in this area were assigned to the four regional military districts (the <a href="Northern%20District%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Northern</a>, <a href="Eastern%20District%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Eastern</a>, <a href="Central%20District%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Central</a> and <a href="Western%20District%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Western</a> districts) which reported directly to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20War%20of%20Japan">Ministry of War</a>. As a result, the GDC's functions were limited to coordinating communications between the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a>—Japan's highest military decision-making body—and the military districts. In early 1942, forces allocated to the defense of Japan comprised 100 <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Force">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a> (IJAAF) and 200 <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) fighter aircraft, many of which were obsolete, as well as 500 Army-manned and 200 IJN anti-aircraft guns. Most of the IJAAF and IJN formations in the home islands were training units which had only a limited ability to counter Allied attacks. The Army also operated a network of military and civilian observation posts to provide warning of air attack and was in the process of building <a href="radar">radar</a> stations. Command and control of the air defenses was fragmented, and the IJAAF and IJN did not coordinate their activities or communicate with each other. As a result, the forces were unable to react to a sudden air attack.

Japanese cities were highly vulnerable to damage from <a href="firebombing">firebombing</a> due to their design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from highly flammable materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings. Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a>s and most relied on volunteers. Such firefighting forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics. Air raid drills had been held in Tokyo and Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local governments were required to provide civilians with manuals that explained how to respond to air attacks. Few <a href="air-raid%20shelter">air-raid shelter</a>s and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.

The ROCAF conducted a single attack on the Japanese home islands during the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 19 May 1938 two ROCAF aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets on <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, <a href="Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a>, <a href="Kurume">Kurume</a>, <a href="Saga%20%28city%29">Saga</a>, and other locations in <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>. These leaflets did not have any effect on Japanese civilians, but demonstrated that China could potentially conduct small scale air attacks on the area. The Japanese military later incorrectly concluded that the ROCAF had aircraft capable of mounting attacks at a range of from their bases, and took precautions against potential raids on western Japan when Chinese forces launched an offensive during 1939.

USAAF aircraft bombed Japan for the first time in mid-April 1942. In an operation conducted primarily to raise morale in the United States and to avenge the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, 16 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers were carried from San Francisco to within range of Japan on the aircraft carrier . These aircraft were launched on 18 April, and individually bombed targets in Tokyo, <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, <a href="Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a>, <a href="Nagoya">Nagoya</a> and <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>. The Japanese air defense units were taken by surprise, and all the B-25s escaped without serious damage. The aircraft then continued to China and the Soviet Union, though several crashed in Japanese-held territory after running out of fuel. Japanese casualties were 50 killed and over 400 wounded. About 200 houses were also destroyed.

Although the Doolittle Raid caused little damage, it had important ramifications. The attack raised morale in the United States and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="James%20H.%20Doolittle">James H. Doolittle</a>, was seen as a hero. The weak state of the country's air defenses greatly embarrassed the Japanese military leadership, and four fighter <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">groups</a> were transferred from the Pacific to defend the home islands. In an attempt to prevent further naval raids, the IJN launched an offensive in the Pacific Ocean which ended in defeat during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. The Japanese Army also conducted the <a href="Zhejiang-Jiangxi%20Campaign">Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign</a> to capture the airfields in central China at which the Doolittle Raiders had intended to land. This offensive achieved its objectives and resulted in the deaths of 250,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians; many of these civilian deaths were due to <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s. The destruction of the airfields and heavy casualties badly damaged China's war effort. The IJA also began developing <a href="Fu-Go%20balloon%20bomb">fire balloons</a> capable of carrying incendiary and anti-personnel bombs from Japan to the continental United States.

Following the Doolittle Raid, the next air attacks on Japan were made against the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> in mid-1943. The liberation of Alaska's <a href="Attu%20Island">Attu Island</a> in May 1943 during the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">Aleutian Islands Campaign</a> provided the USAAF with bases within range of the Kurils. As part of the preparations for the liberation of <a href="Kiska%20Island">Kiska Island</a> in the Aleutians, the <a href="Eleventh%20Air%20Force">Eleventh Air Force</a> conducted a series of raids against the Kurils to suppress the Japanese air units stationed there. The first of these attacks was made against southern <a href="Shumshu">Shumshu</a> and northern <a href="Paramushir">Paramushir</a>u by eight B-25s on 10 July. The Kurils were attacked again on 18 July by six B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, and the unopposed liberation of Kiska (<a href="Operation%20Cottage">Operation Cottage</a>) took place on 15 August.

The Eleventh Air Force and US Navy units continued to make small-scale raids on the Kuril Islands until the closing months of the war. The USAAF attacks were broken off for five months following a raid on 11 September 1943 when nine of the 20 B-24s and B-25s dispatched were lost, but raids by US Navy <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalinas</a> continued. In response to the American attacks, the IJN established the North-East Area Fleet in August 1943, and in November that year Japanese fighter strength in the Kurils and <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> peaked at 260 aircraft. The Eleventh Air Force resumed its offensive in February 1944 after it had been reinforced with two <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a> of <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a> escort fighters, and it continued to attack targets in the Kurils until June 1945. While these raids caused little damage, they caused the Japanese to divert large numbers of soldiers to defend their northern islands against a potential United States invasion.

In late 1943, the United States <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> approved a proposal to begin the <a href="Strategic%20bombing">strategic air campaign</a> against the Japanese home islands and East Asia by basing <a href="B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> heavy bombers in India and establishing forward airfields in China. This strategy, designated <a href="Operation%20Matterhorn">Operation Matterhorn</a>, involved the construction of large airstrips near <a href="Chengdu">Chengdu</a> in inland China which would be used to refuel B-29s traveling from bases in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> en route to targets in Japan. Chennault, by now the commander of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Air%20Force">Fourteenth Air Force</a> in China, advocated building the B-29 bases near <a href="Guilin">Kweilin</a>, closer to Japan, but this area was judged too vulnerable to counterattack. However, the decision to build airstrips at Chengdu meant that <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a> was the only part of the home island chain within the B-29's <a href="combat%20radius">combat radius</a>. Construction of the airfields began in January 1944, and the project involved around 300,000 conscripted Chinese labourers and 75,000 contracted workers.

<a href="XX%20Bomber%20Command">XX Bomber Command</a> was assigned responsibility for Operation Matterhorn, and its ground crew began to leave the United States for India during December 1943. The <a href="Twentieth%20Air%20Force">Twentieth Air Force</a> was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, the commander of the USAAF, General <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, took personal command of this unit and ran it from <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> in Washington, D.C. The <a href="58th%20Air%20Division">58th Bombardment Wing</a> was XX Bomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> to India took place between April and mid-May 1944.

The Japanese military began transferring fighter aircraft to the home islands from China and the Pacific in early 1944 in anticipation of B-29 raids. Japanese <a href="military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> detected the construction of B-29 bases in India and China, and the military began to develop plans to counter air raids originating from China. The three IJAAF air brigades stationed in <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> and Kyūshū were expanded to air divisions between March and June (these were designated the <a href="10th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">10th</a>, <a href="11th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">11th</a> and <a href="12th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">12th Air Divisions</a>). By late June the air defense units in the home islands were assigned 260 fighters, and could draw on approximately 500 additional aircraft during emergencies. Additional anti-aircraft gun batteries and searchlight units were also established to protect major cities and military bases. The GDC's authority was strengthened when the army units in the Eastern, Central and Western military districts were placed under its command in May. The IJN defensive fighter units stationed at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>, <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> and Yokosuka were also assigned to the GDC in July, but cooperation between the GDC's Army units and the much smaller number of naval units was poor. Despite these improvements, Japan's air defenses remained inadequate as few aircraft and anti-aircraft guns could effectively engage B-29s at their cruising altitude of and the number of radar stations capable of providing early warning of raids was insufficient.
The Japanese government also sought to improve the country's civil defenses in response to the Doolittle Raid and the threat of further attacks. The national government placed the burden of constructing civilian air-raid shelters on the <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">prefectural governments</a>. However, few shelters were built due to shortages of concrete and steel. In October 1943 the <a href="Home%20Ministry%20%28Japan%29">Home Ministry</a> directed households in the major cities to build their own shelters, though these were normally only <a href="trench">trench</a>es. A small number of sophisticated shelters were constructed for air defense headquarters and to protect key telephone facilities. However, less than two percent of civilians had access to bombproof air-raid shelters, though tunnels and natural caves were also used to protect civilians from B-29 raids. Following the outbreak of war, the Home Ministry expanded the number of firefighters, though these generally remained volunteers who lacked adequate training and equipment. Civilians were also trained to fight fires and encouraged to swear an "air defense oath" to respond to attacks from incendiary or high explosive bombs.

From autumn 1943 the Japanese government took further steps to prepare the country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create <a href="firebreak">firebreak</a>s began the next month. By the end of the war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Japan%20during%20World%20War%20II">move to the countryside</a> from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.

XX Bomber Command began flying missions against Japan in mid-June 1944. The first raid took place on the night of 15/16 June when 75 B-29s were dispatched to <a href="Bombing%20of%20Yawata%20%28June%201944%29">attack the Imperial Iron and Steel Works</a> at <a href="Yahata%2C%20Fukuoka">Yawata</a> in northern Kyūshū. This attack caused little damage and cost seven B-29s, but received enthusiastic media coverage in the United States and indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. The Japanese military began expanding the fighter force in the home islands after the attack on Yawata, and by October 375 aircraft were assigned to the three air defense air divisions. These divisions remained at about this strength until March 1945. Arnold relieved XX Bomber Command's commander, Brigadier General <a href="Kenneth%20Wolfe">Kenneth Wolfe</a>, shortly after the raid on Yawata when he was unable to make follow-up attacks on Japan due to insufficient fuel stockpiles at the bases in China. Wolfe's replacement was Major General <a href="Curtis%20LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a>, a veteran of <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> bombing attacks against Germany.
Subsequent B-29 raids staging through China generally did not meet their objectives. The second raid took place on 7 July when 17 B-29s attacked Sasebo, <a href="%C5%8Cmura%2C%20Nagasaki">Ōmura</a> and <a href="Tobata-ku%2C%20Kitaky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Tobata</a>, causing little damage, and on the night of 10/11 August 24 Superfortresses attacked <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. Another unsuccessful raid was conducted against Yawata on 20 August in which the B-29 force was intercepted by over 100 fighters. Twelve of the sixty-one Superfortresses that reached the target area were shot down, including one which was destroyed in a suicide <a href="aerial%20ramming">ramming</a> attack. <a href="Japanese%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">Japanese government propaganda</a> claimed that 100 bombers had been downed during this attack, and one of the crashed B-29s was placed on display in Tokyo. XX Bomber Command's performance improved after LeMay instituted a training program and improved the organization of the B-29 maintenance units during August and September. A raid against Ōmura on 25 October destroyed the city's small aircraft factory, though a follow-up raid on 11 November ended in failure. The city was attacked again by 61 B-29s on 21 November and by 17 bombers on 19 December. XX Bomber Command made its ninth and final raid on Japan on 6 January 1945 when 28 B-29s once again struck Ōmura. During the same period the command conducted a number of attacks on targets in <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, China and <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a> from its bases in China, as well as striking targets in Southeast Asia from India. The command flew its final mission from India, a <a href="Bombing%20of%20Singapore%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">raid on Singapore</a>, on 29 March; its constituent units were then transferred to the Mariana Islands.

Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids conducted against Japan via bases in China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XX Bomber Command lost 125 B-29s during all of its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; the majority of the losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses at the expense of other areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XX Bomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.

In 1944 bombing of Japan from the Soviet Union by American aircraft with American or Soviet crews was considered. Following a request from Roosevelt at the <a href="Tehran%20Conference">Tehran Conference</a>, Stalin agreed on 2 February 1944 that the United States could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan. 

In spring 1944, the Soviets asked for assistance in creating a long-range bombing force for Japan, with 300 (lend-lease) B-24s and 240 B-29s. In negotiations in July and August, the United States agreed to supply 200 B-24s (50 per month; probably via Abadan) and to train operational and maintenance crews. But with difficulties over the arrangements, the USSR announced on 29 September that they would forego American training in view of the uncertainty over the B-24s. 

Stalin had agreed at the 1944 <a href="Moscow%20Conference%20%281944%29">Moscow Conference</a> to the United States having air bases near <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> (where six or seven large aerodromes had been built and reserved ) and the use of <a href="Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky">Petropavlovsk</a> (<a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a>) as a base; he "virtually ignored" earlier proposals for a Soviet bombing force. However despite an American team going to Moscow in December 1944 they failed to reach agreement. On 16 December 1944 General <a href="Aleksei%20Antonov">Antonov</a> said that Soviet forces would need all their naval and air bases in the Maritime Provinces' and American B-29s would have to be based far to the north of <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> near the mouth of the <a href="Amur%20River">Amur River</a> in the Komsomolsk-Nikolaevsk area. It was decided to press for this at Yalta. At the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a> (1945) Stalin told Roosevelt that American B-29s would be based at the remote Komsomolsk-Nikolaevsk area. Antonov said that the they would start preliminary base construction. But the proposal lapsed..

During the <a href="Mariana%20and%20Palau%20Islands%20campaign">Mariana Islands campaign</a>, US forces captured Japanese-held islands in the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Guam%20%281944%29">Guam</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">Saipan</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tinian">Tinian</a> between June and August 1944. USAAF and US Navy engineers subsequently constructed six airfields on the islands to accommodate hundreds of B-29s. These bases were more capable of supporting an intensive air campaign against Japan than those in China as they could be easily supplied by sea and were south of Tokyo, which allowed B-29s to strike most areas in the home islands and return without refueling. <a href="Japanese%20air%20attacks%20on%20the%20Mariana%20Islands">Japanese aircraft made several attacks</a> on the airfield at Saipan while it was under construction.
The Twentieth Air Force's <a href="XXI%20Bomber%20Command">XXI Bomber Command</a> began arriving in the Mariana Islands during October 1944. The Command was led by Brigadier General <a href="Haywood%20S.%20Hansell">Haywood S. Hansell</a>, who had also participated in Eighth Air Force operations against Germany. XXI Bomber Command B-29s flew six practice missions against targets in the Central Pacific during October and November in preparation for their first attack on Japan. On 1 November, an F-13 photo reconnaissance variant of the B-29 from the <a href="3d%20Space%20Operations%20Squadron">3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron</a> <a href="1%20November%201944%20reconnaissance%20sortie%20over%20Japan">overflew Tokyo</a>; this was the first American aircraft to fly over the city since the Doolittle Raid. Further F-13 sorties were conducted during early November to gather intelligence on aircraft factories and port facilities in the Tokyo–Yokosuka area. The F-13s were generally able to evade the heavy anti-aircraft fire they attracted and the large numbers of Japanese fighters that were scrambled to intercept them as they flew at both high speed and high altitude.

XXI Bomber Command's initial attacks against Japan were focused on the country's aircraft industry. The first attack, codenamed <a href="Operation%20San%20Antonio%20I">Operation San Antonio I</a>, was made against the Musashino aircraft plant in the outskirts of Tokyo on 24 November 1944. Only 24 of the 111 B-29s dispatched attacked the primary target, and the others bombed port facilities as well as industrial and urban areas. The Americans were intercepted by 125 Japanese fighters but only one B-29 was shot down. This attack caused some damage to the aircraft plant and further reduced Japanese civilians' confidence in the country's air defenses. In response, the IJAAF and IJN stepped up their air attacks on B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands from 27 November; these raids continued until January 1945 and resulted in the destruction of 11 Superfortresses and damage to another 43 for the loss of probably 37 Japanese aircraft. The IJA also began launching <a href="Fu-Go%20balloon%20bomb">Fu-Go balloon bomb</a>s against the United States during November. This campaign caused little damage and was abandoned in March 1945. By this time 9,000 balloons had been dispatched but only 285 were reported to have reached the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>.

The next American raids on Japan were not successful. XXI Bomber Command attacked Tokyo three times between 27 November and 3 December; two of these raids were made against the Musashino aircraft plant while the other targeted an industrial area using <a href="M-69%20incendiary">M-69 incendiary cluster bomb</a>s, specifically developed to damage Japanese urban areas. The aircraft plant attacked on 27 November and 3 December was only lightly damaged as high winds and clouds prevented accurate bombing. The incendiary raid conducted on the night of 29/30 November by 29 Superfortresses burnt out one tenth of a square mile, and was also judged to be unsuccessful by the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters.
Four of XXI Bomber Command's next five raids were <a href="Bombing%20of%20Nagoya%20in%20World%20War%20II">made against targets in Nagoya</a>. The first two of these attacks on 13 and 18 December used precision bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test the effectiveness of these weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to <a href="area%20bombardment">area bombardment</a> would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22 December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXI Bomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27 December, but did not damage the facility. On 3 January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an area bombing raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.

Arnold was disappointed with what XXI Bomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command to produce results quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing was no longer in accordance with the views of the Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XX Bomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve the problems at XXI Bomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6 January, but remained in his position until mid-January. During this period, XXI Bomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo and a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14 January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a <a href="Kawasaki%20Aerospace%20Company">Kawasaki Aircraft Industries</a> factory near <a href="Akashi%2C%20Hy%C5%8Dgo">Akashi</a> on 19 January. During XXI Bomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.

In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly adopted a civil defense plan to counter the American air raids. This plan assigned responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a <a href="Blackout%20%28wartime%29">blackout</a> from 10:00 pm. Japanese positions in the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a> were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and <a href="Civil%20defense%20siren">air raid sirens</a> were sounded in cities threatened by attack.

The first attacks conducted under LeMay's leadership achieved mixed results. XXI Bomber Command flew six major missions between 23 January and 19 February with little success, though an incendiary raid <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kobe%20in%20World%20War%20II">against Kobe</a> on 4 February caused significant damage to the city and its main factories. Moreover, while improved maintenance procedures implemented by LeMay reduced the number of B-29s that had to return to base during raids due to technical problems, the Command suffered a loss rate of 5.1% in these operations. From 19 February to 3 March, XXI Bomber Command conducted a series of precision bombing raids on aircraft factories that sought to tie down Japanese air units so they could not participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Battle of Iwo Jima</a>. However, these attacks were frustrated by high winds and cloud cover and little damage was inflicted. A firebombing raid conducted against Tokyo by 172 B-29s on 25 February was considered successful as it burnt or damaged approximately one square mile of the city's urban area. This attack was a large-scale test of the effectiveness of firebombing.

Several factors explain the poor results of XXI Bomber Command's precision bombing campaign. The most important of these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a>s between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXI Bomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of launching and recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.

USAAF planners began assessing the feasibility of a firebombing campaign against Japanese cities in 1943. Japan's main industrial facilities were vulnerable to such attacks as they were concentrated in several large cities and a high proportion of production took place in homes and small factories in urban areas. The planners estimated that incendiary bomb attacks on Japan's six largest cities could cause physical damage to almost 40 percent of industrial facilities and result in the loss of 7.6 million man-months of labor. It was also estimated that these attacks would kill over 500,000 people, render about 7.75 million homeless and force almost 3.5 million to be evacuated. In 1943 the USAAF tested the effectiveness of incendiary bombs on Japanese-style buildings at <a href="Eglin%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eglin Field</a> and the "<a href="Japanese%20village">Japanese village</a>" at <a href="Dugway%20Proving%20Ground">Dugway Proving Ground</a>. The American military also attempted to develop "<a href="bat%20bomb">bat bomb</a>s", using incendiary bombs attached to bats dropped by aircraft to attack Japanese cities, but this project was abandoned in 1944. During early 1945 the USAAF conducted raids against cities in <a href="Taiwan%20under%20Japanese%20rule">Formosa</a> to trial tactics which could be later used against Japanese urban areas.

<a href="Napalm">Napalm</a>, used by the Americans for <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>s and incendiary bombs, was increased in production from in 1943 to in 1944. Much of the napalm went from nine US factories to bomb-assembly plants making the M-69 incendiary and packing 38 of them into the E-46 cluster bomb; these were shipped across the Pacific and stored for future use. Arnold and the Air Staff wanted to wait to use the incendiaries until a large-scale program of firebombing could be mounted, to overwhelm the Japanese city defenses.

In light of the poor results of the precision bombing campaign and the success of the 25 February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXI Bomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General <a href="Lauris%20Norstad">Lauris Norstad</a>, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.

To maximize the effectiveness of the firebombing attacks, LeMay ordered the B-29s to fly at the low altitude of and bomb by night; this represented a significant change from the Command's standard tactics, which focused on high-altitude daylight bombing. As Japan's <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> force was weak and the anti-aircraft batteries were less effective at night, LeMay also had most of the B-29s' defensive guns removed; by reducing the weight of the aircraft in this way they were able to carry more bombs. These changes were not popular with XXI Bomber Command's aircrew, as they believed that it was safer to fly heavily armed aircraft at high altitude.

The first firebombing attack in this campaign—codenamed <a href="Bombing%20of%20Tokyo%20%2810%20March%201945%29">Operation Meetinghouse</a>—was carried out against Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March, and proved to be the single most destructive air raid of the war. XXI Bomber Command mounted a maximum effort, and on the afternoon of 9 March 346 B-29s left the Marianas bound for Tokyo. They began to arrive over the city at 2:00 am Guam time on 10 March, and 279 bombers dropped 1,665 tons of bombs. The raid caused a massive <a href="conflagration">conflagration</a> that overwhelmed Tokyo's civil defenses and destroyed of buildings, representing seven percent of the city's urban area. The Tokyo police force and fire department estimated that 83,793 people were killed during the air raid, another 40,918 were injured and just over a million lost their homes; postwar estimates of deaths in this attack have ranged from 80,000 to 100,000. Damage to Tokyo's war production was also substantial. Japanese opposition to this attack was relatively weak; 14 B-29s were destroyed as a result of combat or mechanical faults and a further 42 damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Following the attack on Tokyo, the Japanese government ordered the evacuation of all schoolchildren in the third to sixth grades from the main cities, and 87 percent of them had departed to the countryside by early April.

XXI Bomber Command followed up the firebombing of Tokyo with similar raids against other major cities. On 11 March, 310 B-29s were dispatched against Nagoya. The bombing was spread over a greater area than had been the case at Tokyo, and the attack caused less damage. Nevertheless, of buildings were burnt out and no B-29s were lost to the Japanese defenses. On the night of 13/14 March, 274 Superfortresses <a href="Bombing%20of%20Osaka">attacked Osaka</a> and destroyed of the city for the loss of two aircraft. Kobe was the next target in the firebombing campaign, and was attacked by 331 B-29s on the night of 16/17 March. The resulting <a href="firestorm">firestorm</a> destroyed of the city (equivalent to half its area), killed 8,000 people and rendered 650,000 homeless. Three B-29s were lost. Nagoya was attacked again on the night of 18/19 March, and the B-29s destroyed of buildings. Only one Superfortress was shot down during this attack, and all members of its crew were rescued after the aircraft ditched into the sea. This raid marked the end of the first firebombing campaign as XXI Bomber Command had exhausted its supplies of incendiary bombs. The Command's next major operation was an unsuccessful night precision attack on the Mitsubishi aircraft engine factory conducted on the night of 23/24 March; during this operation five of the 251 aircraft dispatched were shot down. B-29s also began to drop propaganda leaflets over Japan during March. These leaflets called on Japanese civilians to overthrow their government or face destruction.

The USAAF assessed that the firebombing campaign had been highly successful, and noted that American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.

The Japanese government was concerned about the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.

The start of the major firebombing campaign was delayed as XXI Bomber Command was used to attack airfields in southern Japan from late March to mid-May in support of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a>, an island only a few hundred miles south of the home islands. Prior to the landings on 1 April, the Command bombed airfields in Kyushu at <a href="%C5%8Cita%2C%20%C5%8Cita">Ōita</a> and <a href="Tachiarai%2C%20Fukuoka">Tachiarai</a> as well as an aircraft plant at Ōmura on 27 March, and struck Ōita and Tachiarai again on the 31st of the month. No B-29s were lost in these raids. From 6 April the Japanese conducted large-scale <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> air raids on the Allied invasion fleet, during which suicide aircraft damaged or sank many warships and transports. As part of the Allied response to these attacks, XXI Bomber Command conducted major raids on airfields in Kyushu on 8 and 16 April, though the first of these attacks was diverted to strike residential areas in <a href="Kagoshima">Kagoshima</a> after the airfields were found to be covered by clouds. From 17 April until 11 May, when the B-29s were released for other duties, about three quarters of XXI Bomber Command's effort was devoted to attacking airfields and other targets in direct support of the Battle of Okinawa; this included 2,104 sorties flown against 17 airfields. These raids cost the Command 24 B-29s destroyed and 233 damaged and failed to completely suppress kamikaze attacks from the targeted airfields.
A few attacks on Japanese cities were conducted during the Battle of Okinawa. On 1 April, a night precision bombing raid was flown against the Nakajima engine factory in Tokyo by 121 B-29s and three similar attacks were conducted against engine factories in <a href="Shizuoka%20City">Shizuoka</a>, Koizumi and <a href="Tachikawa">Tachikawa</a> on the night of 3 April. These raids were unsuccessful as XXI Bomber Command lacked the specialized equipment needed to strike targets accurately at night, and LeMay decided not to conduct similar operations. Small forces of B-29s also struck Tokyo and nearby <a href="Kawasaki%2C%20Kanagawa">Kawasaki</a> on 4 April. Two successful large-scale precision bombing raids were flown against aircraft factories in Tokyo and Nagoya on 7 April; the raid on Tokyo was the first to be escorted by Iwo Jima-based <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> very-long-range fighters from the <a href="46th%20Fighter%20Wing%20%28World%20War%20II%29">VII Fighter Command</a>, and the Americans claimed to have shot down 101 Japanese aircraft for the loss of two P-51s and seven B-29s. Over 250 B-29s struck three different aircraft factories on 12 April; during this operation the <a href="73d%20Air%20Division">73rd Bombardment Wing</a> inflicted heavy damage on the Musashino aircraft plant and fought off 185 Japanese fighters without loss. LeMay resumed night firebombing raids on 13 April when 327 B-29s attacked the arsenal district of Tokyo and destroyed of the city, including several armaments factories. On 15 April, 303 Superfortresses attacked the Tokyo region and destroyed of Tokyo, of Kawasaki and of Yokohama for the loss of 12 bombers. On 24 April the Tachikawa aircraft engine factory at Yamato near Tokyo was destroyed by 131 B-29s. An attack on the aircraft arsenal at Tachikawa six days later was aborted due to cloud cover; some of the heavy bombers attacked the city of <a href="Hamamatsu">Hamamatsu</a> instead. Another precision raid was made against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory at Kure on 5 May when 148 B-29s inflicted heavy damage on the facility. Five days later B-29s successfully attacked oil storage facilities at <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a>, Ōshima and <a href="Toyama%20City">Toyama</a>. On 11 May a small force of B-29s destroyed an airframe factory at Konan. XXI Bomber Command reached its full strength in April when the 58th and <a href="315th%20Air%20Division">315th Bombardment Wings</a> arrived in the Marianas; at this time the command comprised five <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wings</a> equipped with a total of 1,002 B-29s and was the most powerful air unit in the world.
After being released from supporting the Okinawa campaign, XXI Bomber Command conducted an intensive firebombing campaign against Japan's main cities from mid-May. A force of 472 B-29s struck Nagoya by day on 13 May and destroyed of the city. The Japanese mounted a strong defense that downed two Superfortresses and damaged another 64; another eight B-29s were lost to other causes. The Americans claimed 18 Japanese fighter "kills" as well as another 30 "probables" and 16 damaged. Nagoya was attacked again by 457 B-29s on the night of 16 May, and the resulting fires destroyed of the city. Japanese defenses were much weaker by night, and the three bombers lost in this attack crashed due to mechanical problems. The two raids on Nagoya killed 3,866 Japanese and rendered another 472,701 homeless. On 19 May, 318 B-29s conducted an unsuccessful precision bombing raid on the Tachikawa Aircraft Company. XXI Bomber Command made further large-scale firebombing attacks against Tokyo on the nights of 23 and 25 May. In the first of these raids 520 B-29s destroyed of southern Tokyo with 17 aircraft lost and 69 damaged. The second attack involved 502 B-29s and destroyed of the city's central area, including the headquarters of several key government ministries and much of the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Tokyo Imperial Palace</a>; the bomber crews had been briefed to not target the palace as the US Government did not want to risk killing Emperor <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a>. The Japanese defenses were relatively successful on this occasion, and 26 Superfortresses were shot down and another 100 damaged. By the end of these raids just over half (50.8 percent) of Tokyo had been destroyed and the city was removed from XXI Bomber Command's target list. The Command's last major raid of May was a daylight incendiary attack on Yokohama on 29 May conducted by 517 B-29s escorted by 101 P-51s. This force was intercepted by 150 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a> fighters, sparking an intense air battle in which five B-29s were shot down and another 175 damaged. In return, the P-51 pilots claimed 26 "kills" and 23 "probables" for the loss of three fighters. The 454 B-29s that reached Yokohama struck the city's main business district and destroyed of buildings; over 1000 Japanese were killed. Overall, the attacks in May destroyed of buildings, which was equivalent to one seventh of Japan's total urban area. The <a href="Home%20Ministry%20%28Japan%29">Minister of Home Affairs</a>, <a href="Iwao%20Yamazaki">Iwao Yamazaki</a>, concluded after these raids that Japan's civil defense arrangements were "considered to be futile".
The firebombing campaign against major cities ended in June. On the first day of the month 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed of buildings. On 5 June, 473 B-29s struck Kobe by day and destroyed of buildings for the loss of 11 bombers. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7 June; during this attack of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time in the month on 15 June when 444 B-29s destroyed of the city and another of nearby <a href="Amagasaki">Amagasaki</a>; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka. This attack marked the end of the first phase of XXI Bomber Command's attack on Japan's cities. During May and June the bombers had destroyed much of the country's six largest cities, killing between 112,000 and 126,762 people and rendering millions homeless. The widespread destruction and high number of casualties from these raids caused many Japanese to realize that their country's military was no longer able to defend the home islands. American losses were low compared to Japanese casualties; 136 B-29s were downed during the campaign. In Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, and Kawasaki, "over 126,762 people were killed ... and a million and a half dwellings and over of urban space were destroyed." In Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, "the areas leveled (almost ) exceeded the areas <a href="Combined%20Bomber%20Offensive">destroyed</a> in all <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> cities by both the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">American</a> and <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">British air forces</a> (approximately )."

In mid-June Arnold visited LeMay's headquarters at Saipan. During this visit he approved a proposal for XXI Bomber Command to attack 25 relatively small cities with populations ranging from 62,280 to 323,000 while also continuing precision raids on major targets. This decision was made despite a recommendation from the <a href="Strategic%20bombing%20survey">United States Strategic Bombing Survey</a> (USSBS) team, which was assessing the effectiveness of air attacks on Germany, that operations against Japan should focus on the country's transportation network and other targets with the goal of crippling the movement of goods and destroying food supplies. LeMay's plan called for precision attacks on important industrial targets on days when the weather over Japan was clear and incendiary attacks guided by radar on overcast days. As both the cities and industrial facilities targeted were relatively small, the B-29 force would be sent against multiple locations on days in which attacks were conducted. This targeting policy, which was labeled the "Empire Plan", remained in force until the last days of the war.

Five major precision bombing attacks were conducted as part of the Empire Plan. On 9 June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at <a href="Shinkamigot%C5%8D%2C%20Nagasaki">Narao</a> and another two groups raided a factory in <a href="Atsuta-ku%2C%20Nagoya">Atsuta</a>; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXI Bomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22 June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure, <a href="Kakamigahara%2C%20Gifu">Kakamigahara</a>, <a href="Himeji%2C%20Hy%C5%8Dgo">Himeji</a>, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted were badly damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets. Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24 July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.
XXI Bomber Command began incendiary raids against small cities from 17 June. On that night, Hamamatsu, Kagoshima, <a href="%C5%8Cmuta%2C%20Fukuoka">Ōmuta</a>, <a href="Yokkaichi%2C%20Mie">Yokkaichi</a> were each attacked by a wing of B-29s using similar tactics to those employed in the firebombing raids against the major cities. Of the 477 B-29s dispatched, 456 struck their targets and Hamamatsu, Kagoshima, Yokkaichi suffered extensive damage; overall of buildings were destroyed. The cities were almost undefended and no B-29s were lost to Japanese actions. This operation was judged a success, and set the pattern for XXI Bomber Command's firebombing attacks until the end of the war. As the campaign continued and the most important cities were destroyed, the bombers were sent against smaller and less significant cities. On most nights that raids were conducted, four cities were attacked, each by a wing of bombers. Two-wing operations were conducted against <a href="Bombing%20of%20Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a> on 19 June and Ōmuta on 26 July, however. Sixteen multi-city incendiary attacks had been conducted by the end of the war (an average of two per week), and these targeted 58 cities. The incendiary raids were coordinated with precision bombing attacks during the last weeks of the war in an attempt to force the Japanese government to surrender. As the small cities were not defended by anti-aircraft guns and Japan's night-fighter force was ineffective, only a single B-29 was shot down during this campaign; a further 66 were damaged and 18 crashed as a result of accidents.
The firebombing campaign against small cities continued through June and July. On the night of 19 June B-29s struck Fukuoka, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Shizuoka%20in%20World%20War%20II">Shizuoka</a> and <a href="Toyohashi%20Air%20Raid">Toyohashi</a>. On 28 June <a href="Moji-ku%2C%20Kitaky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Moji</a>, <a href="Nobeoka%2C%20Miyazaki">Nobeoka</a>, <a href="Okayama">Okayama</a> and <a href="Sasebo%2C%20Nagasaki">Sasebo</a> were attacked. <a href="Kumamoto%2C%20Kumamoto">Kumamoto</a>, Kure, <a href="Shimonoseki%2C%20Yamaguchi">Shimonoseki</a> and <a href="Ube%2C%20Yamaguchi">Ube</a> were bombed on 1 July. Two nights later, <a href="Himeji">Himeji</a>, <a href="K%C5%8Dchi%2C%20K%C5%8Dchi">Kōchi</a>, <a href="Takamatsu%2C%20Kagawa">Takamatsu</a> and <a href="Tokushima%2C%20Tokushima">Tokushima</a> were attacked. On 6 July, attacks were conducted against Akashi, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Chiba%20in%20World%20War%20II">Chiba</a>, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kofu%20in%20World%20War%20II">Kōfu</a> and <a href="Shimizu-ku%2C%20Shizuoka">Shimizu</a>. <a href="Gifu%2C%20Gifu">Gifu</a>, <a href="Sakai%2C%20Osaka">Sakai</a>, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Sendai%20during%20World%20War%20II">Sendai</a> and <a href="Wakayama%2C%20Wakayama">Wakayama</a> were struck on 9 July. Three nights later, the B-29s targeted <a href="Ichinomiya%2C%20Aichi">Ichinomiya</a>, <a href="Tsuruga%2C%20Fukui">Tsuruga</a>, <a href="Utsunomiya%2C%20Tochigi">Utsunomiya</a> and <a href="Uwajima%2C%20Ehime">Uwajima</a>. On 16 July, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Hiratsuka%20in%20World%20War%20II">Hiratsuka</a>, <a href="Kuwana%2C%20Mie">Kuwana</a>, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Numazu%20in%20World%20War%20II">Namazu</a> and <a href="%C5%8Cita%2C%20%C5%8Cita">Ōita</a> were attacked. <a href="Ch%C5%8Dshi%2C%20Chiba">Chōshi</a>, <a href="Fukui%2C%20Fukui">Fukui</a>, <a href="Hitachi%2C%20Ibaraki">Hitachi</a>, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Okazaki%20in%20World%20War%20II">Okazaki</a> were bombed on 19 July. After a break of almost a week, <a href="Matsuyama%2C%20Ehime">Matsuyama</a>, Omuta and <a href="Tokuyama%2C%20Yamaguchi">Tokuyama</a> were firebombed on 26 July.
XXI Bomber Command also conducted an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It has been estimated that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda leaflets in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties against civilians who kept copies of these leaflets. On the night of 27/28 July, six B-29s dropped leaflets over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and convince them that the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties. Six of these cities (<a href="Bombing%20of%20Aomori%20in%20World%20War%20II">Aomori</a>, Ichinomiya, <a href="Tsu%2C%20Mie">Tsu</a>, <a href="Ise%2C%20Mie">Uji-Yamada</a> <a href="%C5%8Cgaki%2C%20Gifu">Ōgaki</a> and Uwajima) were attacked on 28 July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five were hit by anti-aircraft fire.
August 1945 began with further large-scale raids against Japanese cities. On the 1st of the month, 836 B-29s staged the largest single raid of World War II, dropping 6,145 tons of bombs and mines. The cities of <a href="Hachi%C5%8Dji%2C%20Tokyo">Hachiōji</a>, <a href="Mito%2C%20Ibaraki">Mito</a>, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Nagaoka">Nagaoka</a> and <a href="Toyama%2C%20Toyama">Toyama</a> were the main targets of this operation; all four suffered extensive damage and 99.5 percent of buildings in Toyama were destroyed. The cities of <a href="Imabari%2C%20Ehime">Imabari</a>, <a href="Maebashi%2C%20Gunma">Maebashi</a>, <a href="Nishinomiya">Nishinomiya</a> and <a href="Saga%2C%20Saga">Saga</a> were attacked on 5 August. These raids had also been preceded by propaganda leaflets and radio broadcasts from Saipan warning that the cities would be attacked.

From late June the 315th Bombardment Wing conducted a series of night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced <a href="AN/APQ-7">AN/APQ-7</a> radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi on the night of 26 June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the refinery destroyed or damaged 30 percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a refinery at <a href="Kudamatsu%2C%20Yamaguchi">Kudamatsu</a> three nights later, and on the night of 2 July it struck another refinery at <a href="Arida%2C%20Wakayama">Minoshima</a>. On the night of 6/7 July the 315th Bombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities by the end of the war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.

During mid-July the USAAF strategic bomber forces in the Pacific were reorganized. On 16 July, XXI Bomber Command was re-designated the Twentieth Air Force and LeMay appointed its commander. Two days later the <a href="United%20States%20Strategic%20Air%20Forces%20in%20the%20Pacific">United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific</a> (USASTAF) was established at Guam under the command of General <a href="Carl%20Andrew%20Spaatz">Carl Spaatz</a>. USASTAF's role was to command the Twentieth Air Force as well as the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a>, which at the time was moving from Europe to Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was led by James Doolittle (who had been promoted to general) and was being reequipped with B-29s. The Commonwealth <a href="Tiger%20Force%20%28air%29">Tiger Force</a>, which was to include Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand heavy bomber squadrons and attack Japan from Okinawa, was also to come under the command of USASTAF when it arrived in the region during late 1945.

From mid-1944, the US Navy pressed for B-29s to be used to lay <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s in Japan's home waters to strengthen the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response to repeated requests from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the <a href="313th%20Air%20Division">313th Bombardment Wing</a> to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign <a href="Operation%20Starvation">Operation Starvation</a>. As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweeping</a> force up to date. As a result, the IJN was unprepared for the large-scale USAAF offensive.

The 313th Bombardment Wing conducted its first mine-laying operation on the night of 27/28 March when it mined the <a href="Kanmon%20Straits">Shimonoseki Strait</a> to prevent Japanese warships from using this route to attack the US landing force off Okinawa. Mine-laying operations were disrupted in April as the wing was assigned to support operations in Okinawa and participate in conventional bombing raids. Its rate of effort increased in May, when it conducted missions against harbors and other choke points around Honshu and Kyushu. The air-dropped minefields greatly disrupted Japanese coastal shipping.

LeMay increased the number of mine-laying sorties in June, and the <a href="505th%20Bombardment%20Group">505th Bombardment Group</a> joined the 313th Bombardment Wing on occasion. In response to this offensive, the Japanese greatly expanded their mine-sweeping force by 349 ships and 20,000 men and deployed additional anti-aircraft guns around the Shimonoseki Strait. They had little success in permanently clearing minefields or downing the B-29s, however. Many of Japan's major harbors, including those of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya, became permanently closed to shipping. During the last weeks of the war, B-29s continued to drop large numbers of mines off Japan and the campaign was expanded into Korean waters. The 313th Bombardment Wing lost only 16 B-29s during mine-laying operations. Overall, mines dropped by Superfortresses off the home islands sank 293 ships, which represented 9.3 percent of all Japanese merchant shipping destroyed during the Pacific War and 60 percent of losses between April and August 1945. Following the war, the USSBS assessed that the Twentieth Air Force should have placed a greater emphasis on attacking Japanese shipping given the effectiveness of these attacks.

The US Navy conducted its first attacks against the Japanese home islands in mid-February 1945. This operation was undertaken primarily to destroy Japanese aircraft that could attack the US Navy and Marine Corps forces involved with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">landing on Iwo Jima</a> on 19 February, and was conducted by <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Task Force 58</a> (TF 58). This task force was the US Navy's main striking force in the Pacific, and comprised 11 <a href="fleet%20carrier">fleet carrier</a>s, five <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a>s and a powerful force of escorts. TF 58 approached Japan undetected, and attacked airfields and aircraft factories in the Tokyo region on 16 and 17 February. The American naval aviators claimed 341 "kills" against Japanese aircraft and the destruction of a further 160 on the ground for the loss of 60 aircraft in combat and 28 in accidents. Several ships were also attacked and sunk in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a>. The actual Japanese aircraft losses in this operation are uncertain, however; the Imperial General Headquarters admitted losing 78 aircraft in dogfights and did not provide a figure for those destroyed on the ground. TF 58's ships were not attacked during this period in Japanese waters, and on 18 February sailed south to provide direct support to the landings on Iwo Jima. The Task Force attempted a second raid against the Tokyo area on 25 February, but this operation was frustrated by bad weather. The American ships sailed south, and attacked <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> from 1 March.

TF 58 renewed its attacks on Japan in mid-March when it made a series of raids that sought to destroy Japanese aircraft within range of Okinawa prior to the landing there. On 18 March, carrier aircraft struck Japanese airfields and other military facilities on <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>. The next day they <a href="Attack%20on%20Kure%20%28March%201945%29">attacked Japanese warships at Kure and Kobe</a>, damaging the battleship and aircraft carrier . The Japanese fought back against these raids with kamikaze and conventional attacks, and inflicted light damage on three carriers on 18 March and severely damaged the next day. On 20 March, TF 58 sailed south but continued fighter sweeps over Kyushu to suppress Japanese aircraft. During the attacks on 18 and 19 March, the American naval aviators claimed to have destroyed 223 Japanese aircraft in the air and 250 on the ground, while the Japanese placed their losses as 161 of the 191 aircraft they committed in the air and an unspecified number on the ground. From 23 March, TF 58 conducted strikes against Okinawa, though its aircraft made further sweeps of Kyushu on 28 and 29 March. Following the landing on 1 April, TF 58 provided air defense for the naval force off Okinawa and regularly conducted patrols over Kyushu. In an attempt to stem the large-scale Japanese air attacks against the Allied ships, part of TF 58 struck at kamikaze aircraft bases on Kyushu and <a href="Shikoku">Shikoku</a> on 12 and 13 May. On 27 May, Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey</a> assumed command of the Fifth Fleet (redesignated the Third Fleet) from Admiral <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Spruance">Raymond A. Spruance</a>. TF 58, renumbered TF 38, continued operations off Okinawa in late May and June, and on 2 and 3 June one of its task groups attacked airfields on Kyushu. Another attack was made against these airfields on 8 June; two days later, TF 38 left Japanese waters for a period of recuperation at <a href="Leyte%20Island">Leyte</a> in the Philippines.
On 1 July, TF 38 sailed from Leyte to strike at the Japanese home islands. At this time the Task Force comprised nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Halsey sought to coordinate his fleet's attacks during the last months of the war with those of the USAAF's land-based aircraft, but the two forces often operated separately. On 10 July TF 38's aircraft conducted raids on airfields in the Tokyo region, destroying several aircraft on the ground. No Japanese fighters were encountered in the air, however, as they were being kept in reserve for a planned large-scale suicide attack on the Allied fleet. Following this raid TF 38 steamed north, and began a major attack on <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20attacks%20on%20Hokkaido%20and%20northern%20Honshu">Hokkaido and northern Honshu</a> on 14 July. These strikes continued the next day, and sank eight of the 12 railway car ferries which carried coal from Hokkaido to Honshu and damaged the remaining four. Many other ships were also destroyed in this area, including 70 out of the 272 small sailing ships which carried coal between the islands. Once again no Japanese aircraft opposed this attack, though 25 were destroyed on the ground. The loss of the railway car ferries reduced the amount of coal shipped from Hokkaido to Honshu by 80 percent, which greatly hindered production in Honshu's factories. This operation has been described as the single most effective strategic air attack of the Pacific War. TF 38's battleships and cruisers also began a series of <a href="Allied%20naval%20bombardments%20of%20Japan%20during%20World%20War%20II">bombardments of industrial targets</a> on 14 July which continued until almost the end of the war.

Following the attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu TF 38 sailed south and was reinforced by the main body of the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>, which was designated Task Force 37 and included another four fleet carriers. Strikes on the Tokyo area on 17 July were disrupted by bad weather, but the next day aircraft from the fleet <a href="Attack%20on%20Yokosuka">attacked Yokosuka naval base</a> where they damaged the battleship and sank four other warships. On 24, 25 and 28 July the Allied fleet <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kure%20%28July%201945%29">attacked Kure and the Inland Sea</a> and sank an aircraft carrier and three battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers, a light cruiser and several other warships. A force of 79 USAAF Liberators flying from Okinawa participated in this attack on 28 July. Allied casualties in this operation were heavy, however, as 126 aircraft were shot down. On 29 and 30 July the carrier aircraft struck at <a href="Maizuru%2C%20Kyoto">Maizuru</a>, sinking three small warships and 12 merchant vessels, before the fleet sailed east to avoid a typhoon and replenish its supplies. Its next attacks against Japan took place on 9 and 10 August, and were directed at a buildup of Japanese aircraft in northern Honshu which Allied intelligence believed were to be used to conduct a commando raid against the B-29 bases in the Marianas. The naval aviators claimed to have destroyed 251 aircraft in their attacks on 9 August and damaged a further 141. On 13 August, TF 38's aircraft attacked the Tokyo region again and claimed to have destroyed 254 Japanese aircraft on the ground and 18 in the air. Another raid was launched against Tokyo on the morning of 15 August, and the 103 aircraft of its first wave attacked their targets. The second wave aborted its attack when word was received that Japan had agreed to surrender. Several Japanese aircraft were shot down while attempting to attack TF 38 later that day, however.

USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters of the VII Fighter Command stationed at Iwo Jima from March 1945 were initially used mainly to escort B-29s. They also conducted a series of independent ground attack missions against targets in the home islands. The first of these operations took place on 16 April, when 57 P-51s strafed <a href="Kanoya%20Air%20Field">Kanoya Air Field</a> in Kyushu. In operations conducted between 26 April and 22 June the American fighter pilots claimed the destruction of 64 Japanese aircraft and damage to another 180 on the ground, as well as a further ten shot down in flight; these claims were lower than the American planners had expected, however, and the raids were considered unsuccessful. USAAF losses were 11 P-51s to enemy action and seven to other causes.

Due to the lack of Japanese air opposition to the American bomber raids, VII Fighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a>s. By the end of the war, VII Fighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.

From May 1945 aircraft of the USAAF's <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> and <a href="Seventh%20Air%20Force">Seventh Air Force</a>, which were grouped under the <a href="Pacific%20Air%20Forces">Far East Air Force</a> (FEAF), also attacked targets in Kyushu and western Honshu from bases in Okinawa and other locations in the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>. These raids formed part of the preparation for the invasion of Japan. From 17 May, <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47 Thunderbolt</a> fighters flying from the Ryukyus made frequent day and night patrols over Kyushu to disrupt the Japanese air units there. On 21 June an additional fighter group joined this effort, and the campaign was reinforced by bombers and another fighter group from 1 July. While these American operations were initially fiercely contested, from early July onwards they encountered little opposition as the Japanese aircraft were withdrawn so that they could be preserved for later operations. Between 1 and 13 July, the Americans flew 286 medium and heavy bomber sorties over Kyushu without loss. As the fighters met few Japanese aircraft, they were mainly used to attack transportation infrastructure and targets of opportunity; these included at least two <a href="strafing">strafing</a> attacks on groups of civilians.

Attacks on airfields and transportation infrastructure in southern Japan continued until the end of the war. By this time the Fifth Air Force's bombers had flown 138 sorties against airfields in Kyushu and the Seventh Air Force had conducted a further 784. Road and railway bridges were attacked by both fighters and bombers, and the city of Kagoshima was frequently bombed. Seventh Air Force B-24 Liberators also bombed the railway terminals in the port of Nagasaki on 31 July and 1 August. While these raids were focused on tactical targets, the Okinawa-based aircraft made several strategic attacks against industrial facilities; these included an unsuccessful raid on a coal liquefaction plant at Ōmuta on 7 August. Bombers of the Fifth and Seventh Air Forces also made firebombing attacks against <a href="Tarumizu%2C%20Kagoshima">Tarumizu</a> on 5 August, Kumamoto on 10 August and <a href="Kurume%2C%20Fukuoka">Kurume</a> the next day. The FEAF staged its last attacks against Japan on 12 August; aircraft were dispatched on 14 August but recalled while en route to their targets. Overall, the two air forces flew 6,435 sorties against targets in Kyushu during July and August for the loss of 43 aircraft to Japanese anti-aircraft guns and fighters.

Japan's air defenses were unable to stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN <a href="Radar%20picket">picket ships</a>, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict the target of the attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to <a href="Scrambling%20%28military%29">scramble</a> and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; by the end of the war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.
Air combat was most intense in late 1944 and early 1945. Following the first B-29 raids on Tokyo, the number of IJN aircraft assigned to air defense duties was greatly increased and all guns were allocated to protect the capital. Fighters stationed to defend Japan's main industrial areas frequently intercepted American air raids between 24 November 1944 and 25 February 1945, and inflicted significant losses for a period. The number of fighters available declined from late January, however. Poor coordination between the IJAAF and IJN also continued to hamper Japan's defensive efforts throughout this period. The Americans suffered few losses from Japanese fighters during the night raids which were conducted from March 1945 until the end of the war.

Resistance to the air raids decreased sharply from April 1945. On 15 April the IJAAF and IJN air defense units were belatedly placed under a single command when the <a href="Air%20General%20Army">Air General Army</a> was formed under the command of General <a href="Masakazu%20Kawabe">Masakazu Kawabe</a>, but by this time the fighter force's effectiveness had been greatly reduced due to high rates of casualties in training accidents and combat. Due to the poor standard of the remaining pilots and the deployment of P-51 Mustangs to escort B-29s, the Japanese leadership decided in April to withdraw their remaining fighters from combat. These aircraft were placed in reserve to counterattack the Allied invasion. As a result, few of the subsequent Allied raids were intercepted. The effectiveness of Japanese anti-aircraft batteries also decreased during 1945 as the collapse of the national economy led to severe shortages of ammunition. Moreover, as the anti-aircraft guns were mainly stationed near major industrial areas, many of the raids on small cities were almost unopposed. Imperial General Headquarters decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, but by this time there were too few fighters available for this change of tactics to have any effect. The number of fighters assigned to the Air General Army peaked at just over 500 during June and July, but most frontline units had relatively few serviceable aircraft. During the last weeks of the war Superfortresses were able to operate with near impunity owing to the weakness of the Japanese air defenses; LeMay later claimed that during this period "it was safer to fly a combat mission over Japan than it was to fly a B-29 training mission back in the United States".

Overall, Japanese fighters shot down 74 B-29s, anti-aircraft guns accounted for a further 54, and 19 were downed by a combination of anti-aircraft guns and fighters. IJAAF and IJN losses during the defense of Japan were 1,450 aircraft in combat and another 2,750 to other causes.

Many of the Allied airmen who were captured after being shot down over Japan were mistreated. On 8 September 1944, the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Japan">Cabinet of Japan</a> directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a> despite the fact there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time. As a result, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution. The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern <a href="Musashi%20Province">Musashi</a>), which included Tokyo, those captured in the <a href="T%C5%8Dkai%20region">Tōkai</a>, <a href="Ch%C5%ABbu%20region">Chūbu</a> and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or <a href="Summary%20execution">summarily executed</a> by the <a href="Kempeitai">Kempeitai</a> ("Military Police Corps"). For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody. In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.

Of the approximately 545 Allied airmen who were captured in the Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26 May raid on the city. Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5 May were subjected to <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a> at the <a href="Kyushu%20University">Kyushu Imperial University</a>; Professor <a href="Fukujir%C5%8D%20Ishiyama">Fukujirō Ishiyama</a> and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel responsible for the deaths of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the <a href="Yokohama%20War%20Crimes%20Trials">Yokohama War Crimes Trials</a> following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.

Beginning in 1942 the United States, with assistance from Britain and other Allied countries, devoted considerable resources to developing <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s through the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. In December 1944 the USAAF's <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> was formed under the command of Colonel <a href="Paul%20Tibbets">Paul Tibbets</a> to deliver these weapons once they were complete; it deployed to Tinian during May and June 1945. The "<a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a>" test of the first nuclear bomb was successfully conducted on 16 July. Four days later the 509th Composite Group's modified "<a href="Silverplate">Silverplate</a>" B-29s began flying practice raids against Japanese cities, each armed with a single high-explosive <a href="pumpkin%20bomb">"pumpkin" bomb</a>; further practice missions took place on 24, 26 and 29 July. Japanese fighters did not attempt to intercept these aircraft, and their bombing altitude of was beyond the range of most anti-aircraft guns. Meanwhile, on 24 July President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> approved the use of atomic bombs against Japan, and the next day Spaatz received written orders to this effect. These orders specified that the first attack should be made after 3 August, and named <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, <a href="Kokura">Kokura</a>, <a href="Niigata%20%28city%29">Niigata</a> and Nagasaki as targets. <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, Japan's former imperial capital, had been included in an earlier version of the target list but Nagasaki was substituted on the direction of US Secretary of War <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a> owing to Kyoto's cultural value; the city had also been excluded from the urban firebombing raids on the same grounds. On 26 July the United States, Britain and China issued the <a href="Potsdam%20Declaration">Potsdam Declaration</a>, which demanded Japan's surrender after warning that the country would be devastated if the war continued. The Japanese government rejected the Allied demands on 28 July.

Hiroshima was attacked on 6 August. At 8:15 am local time the B-29 "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>", piloted by Tibbets, dropped the "<a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>" atomic bomb over the center of the city. The resulting explosion killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed about of buildings. The six American aircraft involved in this attack returned safely to the Marianas. Postwar estimates of casualties from the attack on Hiroshima range from 66,000 to 80,000 fatalities and 69,000 to 151,000 injured. Tens of thousands more subsequently died as a result of radiation and other injuries from the attack; it has been estimated that 140,000 people had died as a result of the atomic bomb by the end of 1945. Estimates of the total number of fatalities range as high as 230,000. Of the survivors of the bombing, 171,000 were rendered homeless.

Following the attack, a statement from President Truman was broadcast to announce that the United States had used an atomic bomb against Hiroshima and that further air attacks would be conducted on Japan's industrial facilities and transportation network. The statement included a threat that if Japan did not surrender under the terms specified in the Potsdam Declaration it would be subjected to "a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth". Two days later, daylight incendiary raids were conducted against the cities of Yawata and <a href="Fukuyama%2C%20Hiroshima">Fukuyama</a>; these attacks destroyed 21 percent of Yawata's urban area and over 73 percent of Fukuyama. Japanese aircraft intercepted the force dispatched against Yawata and shot down a B-29 and five of the escorting P-47s for the loss of approximately 12 fighters.
The second atomic bomb attack was made on 9 August. On this day, the B-29 "<a href="Bockscar">Bockscar</a>" was dispatched to attack Kokura with the "<a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>" bomb. The city was found to be covered in smoke and haze, however; as a result, the plane's pilot, Major <a href="Charles%20Sweeney">Charles Sweeney</a>, decided to attack the secondary target of Nagasaki instead. The bomb was dropped at 10:58 am local time, and the resulting 20 <a href="TNT%20equivalent">kiloton</a> explosion destroyed of buildings in the <a href="Urakami">Urakami</a> district. Official Japanese figures issued in the late 1990s state the total number of people killed as a result of this attack exceeded 100,000. The attack also crippled the city's industrial production; steel production was set back by one year, electrical power was severely reduced for two months and arms production was greatly reduced. All the American aircraft involved in the operation returned safely. The <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">Soviet invasion of Manchuria</a> also began on 9 August, and the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> advanced rapidly. On this day, B-29s dropped three million leaflets on Japanese cities warning that atomic bombs would be used to destroy all the country's military resources unless the Emperor ended the war. At this time a third atomic bomb was expected to be ready by the end of August. Eight bombs were scheduled to have been completed by November, and General <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, was advocating that they be reserved for use against tactical targets in support of the planned invasion rather than be dropped on cities.

The Japanese government began negotiations with the Allies about the terms of surrender on 10 August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315th Bombardment Wing against an oil target on the night of 9/10 August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10 August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed. On 11 August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13 August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14 August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of <a href="Kumagaya%2C%20Saitama">Kumagaya</a> and <a href="Isesaki%2C%20Gunma">Isesaki</a> were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as he did not want to risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15 August <a href="Gyokuon-h%C5%8Ds%C5%8D">Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender</a>.

Limited air operations continued over Japan in the weeks following the Japanese government's decision to surrender. On 17 and 18 August, <a href="Consolidated%20B-32%20Dominator">B-32 Dominators</a> flying reconnaissance missions from Okinawa were attacked by IJN fighters near Tokyo. From 17 August the Twentieth Air Force was made responsible for supplying Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan, Korea and China until the prisoners were evacuated. Supply drops began 10 days later, and continued until 20 September. During this period the B-29s flew almost 1,000 sorties and delivered close to 4,500 tons of supplies. Eight aircraft crashed during these missions and another was damaged by a Soviet fighter over Korea. The 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, which had operated over Japan throughout the bombing campaign, also continued its photo reconnaissance and mapping flights over the home islands during this period. While Spaatz ordered that B-29s and fighters fly continuous <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a> patrols of the Tokyo area from 19 August until the formal surrender ceremony took place, these operations were initially frustrated by bad weather and logistics problems. The first patrols were not flown until 30 August, when they were made in conjunction with the landing of General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> and the US Army's <a href="11th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">11th Airborne Division</a> at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Facility%20Atsugi">Atsugi airfield</a>. A similar operation was conducted the next day, and on 2 September 462 B-29s and many naval aircraft overflew the Allied fleet in Tokyo Bay following the surrender ceremony on board .

Allied air units participated in the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> after the war. Advance parties of the FEAF began to arrive at Atsugi airfield on 30 August, and units of the Fifth Air Force were established across the home islands during September and October. Besides transporting occupation troops, the Fifth Air Force conducted armed patrols over Japan and Korea as well and also made many photo reconnaissance and mapping sorties. <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, <a href="Indian%20Air%20Force">Indian Air Force</a>, <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>, US Navy and United States Marine Corps air units were also deployed to Japan for occupation duties. There was no Japanese resistance to the Allied occupation, and the number of air units stationed in the country was gradually reduced from late 1945.

Japan's bomb-damaged cities were rebuilt after the war. War damage and the need to rehouse soldiers and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2 million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major <a href="Urban%20renewal">urban improvement</a> projects were undertaken.

The air attacks on Japan caused hundreds of thousands of casualties, though estimates of the number who were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited in the literature on the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report "The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan" which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks. Another USSBS report, "The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale", included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3 million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a <a href="Sampling%20%28statistics%29">statistical sampling</a> methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate. The postwar Japanese government calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands. The destruction of buildings housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty about the number of casualties. The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.

The following table provides examples of the estimated number of Japanese casualties from air attack in different sources:

Much of Japan's industrial capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, contributing to a large decline in production. Absenteeism caused by the air attacks further reduced output. It is not possible to determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation between the number of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but air attacks were not the only reason for these differences. In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however. Compounding the effects of the air attacks, Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued. In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.

The attacks also caused extensive damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40 percent of the urban area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5 million <a href="Unit%20%28housing%29">housing units</a>, which rendered 8.5 million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced the morale of the Japanese population, and postwar <a href="Statistical%20survey">surveys</a> conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were the most important factor in convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.

Allied air raids significantly influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air attacks on the home islands as the single most important factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister <a href="Kantar%C5%8D%20Suzuki">Kantarō Suzuki</a> stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90 percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.

There has been debate over the morality of the air campaign against Japan since World War II. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and the few people who criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.

The moral concerns over the attacks have focused on the large number of civilian casualties and property damage they caused. For this and other reasons, British philosopher <a href="A.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Grayling">A. C. Grayling</a> has concluded that the Allied area bombing campaigns against both Japan and Germany constituted moral crimes. <a href="Mark%20Selden">Mark Selden</a> described the summer 1945 peak of the bombing campaign as "still perhaps unrivaled in the magnitude of human slaughter" and stated that the factors contributing to its intensity were a combination of "technological breakthroughs, American nationalism, and the erosion of moral and political scruples about killing of civilians, perhaps intensified by the racism that crystallized in the Pacific theater". <a href="Edwin%20Palmer%20Hoyt">Edwin P. Hoyt</a> wrote in 1987 that Japanese people commonly regard the Allied bombing of civilians as the worst atrocity of the war. It has also been suggested that <a href="anti-Japanese%20sentiment">anti-Japanese sentiment</a> was a factor motivating the USAAF's emphasis on firebombing during the campaign against Japan while most of its raids on Germany used precision bombing tactics. However, historian <a href="Richard%20B.%20Frank">Richard B. Frank</a> argues that this difference was attributable to the evolution in views towards bombing over the course of the war, the limited intelligence on the structure of the Japanese economy available to the Allies and the much greater vulnerability of Japanese cities to incendiary bombs.

The moral defense of the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an argument that they saved lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded that the effects of strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was the key factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian <a href="Barrett%20Tillman">Barrett Tillman</a> has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their <a href="bombsight">bombsight</a> and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.
The atomic bomb attacks have been the <a href="Debate%20over%20the%20atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">subject of long-running controversy</a>. Shortly after the attacks an opinion poll found that about 85 percent of Americans supported the use of atomic weapons, and the wartime generation believed that they had saved millions of lives. Criticisms over the decision to use the bombs have increased over time, however. Arguments made against the attacks include that Japan would have eventually surrendered and that the attacks were made to either intimidate the Soviet Union or justify the Manhattan Project. In 1994, an opinion poll found that 55 percent of Americans supported the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When registering the only dissenting opinion of the judges involved in the <a href="International%20Military%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Far%20East">International Military Tribunal for the Far East</a> in 1947, Justice <a href="Radhabinod%20Pal">Radhabinod Pal</a> argued that Japan's leadership had not conspired to commit atrocities and stated that the decision to conduct the atomic bomb attacks was the clearest example of a direct order to conduct "indiscriminate murder" during the Pacific War. Since then, Japanese academics, such as <a href="Yuki%20Tanaka%20%28historian%29">Yuki Tanaka</a> and <a href="Tsuyoshi%20Hasegawa">Tsuyoshi Hasegawa</a>, have argued that use of the bombs was immoral and constituted a war crime. In contrast, President Truman and, more recently, historians such as <a href="Paul%20Fussell">Paul Fussell</a> have argued that the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified as they induced the Japanese surrender.

On two occasions Japanese citizens have sued their government for damages from the bombings, arguing that the government is culpable for having waged a "reckless war" that provoked the bombings and for requiring civilians to remain in the targeted areas. In December 2009 the <a href="Tokyo%20District%20Court">Tokyo District Court</a> dismissed one of the suits, stating that it was not possible to identify individuals who deserve compensation as almost all Japanese suffered as a result of the war. The court also ruled that any compensation should be allocated through the legislative, rather than judicial, process. In December 2011, the Osaka District Court handed down a similar ruling, adding that the government did not violate its constitution in its treatment of bombing victims. This judgement stated that there had not been "unreasonable disparity" in how civilians, soldiers, and atomic bomb survivors were treated, and that the government had showed "no gross deviation from its discretionary right in not legislating for redress measures".

Exosome complex

The exosome complex (or PM/Scl complex, often just called the exosome) is a multi-<a href="protein">protein</a> intracellular <a href="Protein%20complex">complex</a> capable of degrading various types of <a href="RNA">RNA</a> (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> cells and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>, while in <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> a simpler complex called the <a href="degradosome">degradosome</a> carries out similar functions.

The core of the exosome contains a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>, <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, and especially the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a>, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to <a href="Substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a>s specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a>, <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a>, and many species of <a href="small%20RNA">small RNA</a>s. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the <a href="3%E2%80%B2%20end">3′ end</a> in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.

Several proteins in the exosome are the target of <a href="autoantibodies">autoantibodies</a> in patients with specific <a href="autoimmune%20diseases">autoimmune diseases</a> (especially the <a href="Scleromyositis">PM/Scl overlap syndrome</a>) and some <a href="antimetabolite">antimetabolic</a> <a href="chemotherapies">chemotherapies</a> for <a href="cancer">cancer</a> function by blocking the activity of the exosome. In addition, mutations in <a href="exosome%20component%203">exosome component 3</a> cause <a href="pontocerebellar%20hypoplasia">pontocerebellar hypoplasia</a> and spinal <a href="motor%20neuron%20disease">motor neuron disease</a>.

The exosome was first discovered as an <a href="RNase">RNase</a> in 1997 in the budding yeast "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>", an often-used <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>. Not long after, in 1999, it was realized that the exosome was in fact the yeast equivalent of an already described complex in human cells called the "PM/Scl complex", which had been identified as an autoantigen in patients with certain <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s years earlier (see <a href="%23Disease">below</a>). Purification of this "PM/Scl complex" allowed the identification of more human exosome proteins and eventually the characterization of all components in the complex. In 2001, the increasing amount of <a href="Genome%20project">genome data</a> that had become available allowed the prediction of exosome proteins in archaea, although it would take another 2 years before the first exosome complex from an archaeal organism was purified.

The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the <a href="RNase%20PH">RNase PH</a>-like proteins. In archaea there are two different PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure. Of these six eukaryotic proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.

Located on top of this ring are three proteins that have an S1 <a href="RNA-binding%20protein">RNA binding</a> domain (RBD). Two proteins in addition have a <a href="KH%20domain">K-homology (KH) domain</a>. In eukaryotes, three different "S1" proteins are bound to the ring, whereas in archaea either one or two different "S1" proteins can be part of the exosome (although there are always three S1 subunits attached to the complex).
This ring structure is very similar to that of the proteins <a href="RNase%20PH">RNase PH</a> and <a href="polynucleotide%20phoshorylase">PNPase</a>. In bacteria, the protein RNase PH, which is involved in <a href="tRNA">tRNA</a> processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and the <a href="chloroplasts">chloroplasts</a> and <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> of some eukaryotic organisms, two RNase PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be <a href="evolution">evolution</a>arily related and have a <a href="common%20ancestor">common ancestor</a>. In bacteria, a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar six-membered ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits. The RNase PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic <a href="exoribonuclease">exoribonuclease</a>s, meaning that they use <a href="inorganic%20phosphate">inorganic phosphate</a> to remove nucleotides from the <a href="3%27%20end">3' end</a> of <a href="RNA">RNA</a> molecules.

Besides these nine core exosome proteins, two other proteins often associate with the complex in eukaryotic organisms. One of these is Rrp44, a hydrolytic RNase, which belongs to the <a href="RNase%20R">RNase R</a> family of hydrolytic <a href="exoribonuclease">exoribonuclease</a>s (nucleases that use water to cleave the nucleotide bonds). In addition to being an exoribonucleolytic enzyme, Rrp44 also has endoribonucleolytic activity, which resides in a separate domain of the protein. In yeast, Rrp44 is associated with "all" exosome complexes and has a crucial role in the activity of the yeast exosome complex. While a human homologue of the protein exists, no evidence was found for a long time that its human homologue was associated with the human exosome complex. In 2010, however, it was discovered that humans have three Rrp44 homologues and two of these can be associated with the exosome complex. These two proteins most likely degrade different RNA substrates due to their different cellular localization, with one being localized in the cytoplasm (Dis3L1) and the other in the nucleus (Dis3).

Apart from these two tightly bound protein subunits, many proteins interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with <a href="Three%20prime%20untranslated%20region">AU rich element</a> (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.

In addition to single proteins, other protein complexes interact with the exosome. One of those is the cytoplasmic <a href="Ski%20complex">Ski complex</a>, which includes an RNA <a href="helicase">helicase</a> (Ski2) and is involved in mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome is mediated by the <a href="TRAMP%20complex">TRAMP complex</a>, which contains both RNA helicase (Mtr4) and <a href="polyadenylation">polyadenylation</a> (Trf4) activity.

As stated above, the exosome complex contains many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The exact nature of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' <a href="exoribonuclease">exoribonuclease</a>, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their <a href="3%27%20end">3' end</a>. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the <a href="phosphodiester%20bond">phosphodiester bond</a>s – releasing <a href="Adenosine%20diphosphate">nucleotide diphosphates</a>. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolyse</a> these bonds – releasing <a href="Adenosine%20monophosphate">nucleotide monophosphates</a>.

In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of the complex is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein are present in the ring and are responsible for the activity of the complex. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archaea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.

As stated above, the hydrolytic proteins Rrp6 and Rrp44 are associated with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.

The exosome is involved in the degradation and <a href="Post-transcriptional%20modification">processing</a> of a wide variety of RNA species. In the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> of cells, it is involved in the turn-over of <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the <a href="nonsense%20mediated%20decay">nonsense mediated decay</a> or <a href="non-stop%20decay">non-stop decay</a> pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their <a href="MRNA%23Degradation">normal turnover</a>. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the <a href="3%27%20UTR">3' untranslated region</a> of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several <a href="snRNA">small nuclear</a> RNA molecules. Finally, the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a> is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several <a href="snoRNA">small nucleolar RNAs</a>.

Although most cells have other enzymes that can degrade RNA, either from the <a href="3%27%20end">3'</a> or from the <a href="5%27%20end">5' end</a> of the RNA, the exosome complex is essential for cell survival. When the <a href="gene%20expression">expression</a> of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped, for example by <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a>, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, as well as the two main associated proteins, are essential proteins. <a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> do not have an exosome complex; however, similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein <a href="Polynucleotide%20phosphorylase">PNPase</a>, called the "<a href="degradosome">degradosome</a>".
The exosome is a key complex in cellular RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as <a href="ribosomes">ribosomes</a>) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as <a href="protein%20synthesis">protein synthesis</a>.

In addition to RNA processing, turnover and surveillance activities, the exosome is important for the degradation of so-called <a href="cryptic%20unstable%20transcript">cryptic unstable transcript</a>s (CUTs) that are produced from thousands of loci within the yeast genome. The importance of these unstable RNAs and their degradation are still unclear, but similar RNA species have also been detected in human cells.

The exosome complex is the target of <a href="autoantibodies">autoantibodies</a> in patients suffering from various <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the <a href="PM/Scl%20overlap%20syndrome">PM/Scl overlap syndrome</a>, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both <a href="scleroderma">scleroderma</a> and either <a href="polymyositis">polymyositis</a> or <a href="dermatomyositis">dermatomyositis</a>. Autoantibodies can be detected in the <a href="Blood%20plasma">serum</a> of patients by a variety of assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were <a href="Ouchterlony%20double%20immunodiffusion">double immunodiffusion</a> using calf <a href="thymus">thymus</a> extracts, <a href="immunofluorescence">immunofluorescence</a> on HEp-2 cells or <a href="immunoprecipitation">immunoprecipitation</a> from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the "PM/Scl complex". Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a> of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome <a href="biosynthesis">synthesis</a>. More recently, <a href="recombinant%20proteins">recombinant</a> exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and <a href="enzyme%20linked%20immunosorbent%20assay">enzyme linked immunosorbent assay</a>s (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.

In these diseases, antibodies are mainly directed against two of the proteins of the complex, called "PM/Scl-100" (the RNase D like protein) and "PM/Scl-75" (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a <a href="peptide">peptide</a>, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an <a href="ELISA">ELISA</a>, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, but they can also be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.

As the autobodies are found mainly in patients that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the <a href="clinical%20symptom">clinical symptom</a>s of these patients can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include <a href="Raynaud%27s%20phenomenon">Raynaud's phenomenon</a>, <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>, <a href="myositis">myositis</a> and <a href="scleroderma">scleroderma</a>. Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either <a href="immunosuppressive%20drug">immunosuppressive</a> or immunomodulating drugs.

The exosome has been shown to be inhibited by the <a href="antimetabolite">antimetabolite</a> <a href="fluorouracil">fluorouracil</a>, a drug used in the <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. It is one of the most successful drugs for treating solid <a href="tumor">tumor</a>s. In yeast cells treated with fluorouracil, defects were found in the processing of ribosomal RNA identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biological</a> strategies. Lack of correct ribosomal RNA processing is lethal to cells, explaining the antimetabolic effect of the drug.

Mutations in <a href="exosome%20component%203">exosome component 3</a> cause infantile spinal <a href="motor%20neuron%20disease">motor neuron disease</a>, cerebellar atrophy, progressive microcephaly and profound global developmental delay, consistent with <a href="pontocerebellar%20hypoplasia">pontocerebellar hypoplasia</a> type 1B (<a href="http%3A//www.omim.org/entry/614678">PCH1B; MIM 614678</a>).

The Basement Tapes

The Basement Tapes is an <a href="album">album</a> by American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="The%20Band">The Band</a>. It was released on June 26, 1975, by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> and is Dylan's 16th studio album. The songs featuring Dylan's vocals were recorded in 1967, eight years before the album's release, at <a href="Big%20Pink">Big Pink</a> and other houses in and around <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock, New York</a>, where Dylan and The Band lived. Although most of the Dylan songs had appeared on <a href="Bootleg%20recording">bootleg records</a>, "The Basement Tapes" marked the songs' first official release.

During his 1965–1966 world tour, Dylan was backed by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was <a href="Bob%20Dylan%23Motorcycle%20accident%20and%20reclusion">injured in a motorcycle accident</a> in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan was out of the public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded <a href="List%20of%20Basement%20Tapes%20songs">more than 100 tracks</a> together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" and "<a href="Blonde%20on%20Blonde">Blonde on Blonde</a>", toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the <a href="Americana%20%28music%29">Americana</a> genre. For some critics, the songs on "The Basement Tapes", which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> in the late sixties.

When <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> prepared the album for official release in 1975, eight songs recorded solely by The Band—in various locations between 1967 and 1975—were added to 16 songs taped by Dylan and The Band in 1967. Overdubs were added in 1975 to songs from both categories. "The Basement Tapes" was critically acclaimed upon release, reaching number seven on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> album chart. Subsequently, the format of the 1975 album has led critics to question the omission of some of Dylan's best-known 1967 compositions and the inclusion of material by The Band that was not recorded in Woodstock.

By July 1966, Bob Dylan was at the peak of both creative and commercial success. "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" had reached number three on the US album chart in November 1965; the recently released double-LP "<a href="Blonde%20on%20Blonde">Blonde on Blonde</a>" was widely acclaimed. From September 1965 to May 1966, Dylan embarked on an extensive tour across the US, Australia and Europe backed by The Hawks, a band that had formerly worked with rock and roll musician <a href="Ronnie%20Hawkins">Ronnie Hawkins</a>. The Hawks comprised four Canadian musicians—<a href="Rick%20Danko">Rick Danko</a>, <a href="Garth%20Hudson">Garth Hudson</a>, <a href="Richard%20Manuel">Richard Manuel</a> and <a href="Robbie%20Robertson">Robbie Robertson</a>—and one American, <a href="Levon%20Helm">Levon Helm</a>. Dylan's audiences reacted with hostility to the sound of their folk icon backed by a rock band. Dismayed by the negative reception, Helm quit The Hawks in November 1965 and drifted around <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a>, at one point working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The tour culminated in a famously raucous concert in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, England, in May 1966 when an audience member shouted "Judas!" at Dylan for allegedly betraying the cause of politically <a href="progressive%20folk%20music">progressive folk music</a>. Returning exhausted from the hectic schedule of his world tour, Dylan discovered that his manager, <a href="Albert%20Grossman">Albert Grossman</a>, had arranged a further 63 concerts across the US that year.

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his <a href="Triumph%20Engineering%20Co%20Ltd">Triumph</a> motorcycle near his home in <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock, New York</a>, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." In a 1969 "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" interview with <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a>, Dylan said, "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore."

Dylan was rethinking the direction of his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" reporter Michael Iachetta, "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for some of the things that have happened." After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a> concluded that he "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which "he" is in control, not "they". He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman."

Rick Danko recalled that he, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in <a href="West%20Saugerties%2C%20New%20York">West Saugerties</a>, a few miles from Woodstock, in February 1967. The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed "<a href="Big%20Pink">Big Pink</a>"; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife, Dominique. Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing, "<a href="Eat%20the%20Document">Eat the Document</a>", a rarely seen account of Dylan's 1966 world tour. At some point between March and June 1967, Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions, initially at the so-called Red Room of Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the <a href="Byrdcliffe%20Colony">Byrdcliffe</a> area of Woodstock. In June, the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink. Hudson set up a recording unit, using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>. Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner, "That's really the way to do a recording—in a peaceful, relaxed setting—in somebody's basement. With the windows open ... and a dog lying on the floor."

For the first couple of months, they were merely "killing time", according to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like '<a href="The%20Auld%20Triangle">Royal Canal</a>', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us." Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="Ian%20%26amp%3B%20Sylvia">Ian & Sylvia</a>, <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>, <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a> and <a href="Eric%20Von%20Schmidt">Eric Von Schmidt</a>, as well as traditional songs and <a href="Standard%20%28music%29">standards</a>. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, is the way in which Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer <a href="Barney%20Hoskyns">Barney Hoskyns</a> observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the "globe-trotting psychosis" of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.

Dylan began to write and record new material at the sessions. According to Hudson, "We were doing seven, eight, ten, sometimes fifteen songs a day. Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs." Danko told Dylan biographer <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a>, "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." Hudson added, "It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, sit down at the typewriter, and write a song. And what was amazing was that almost every one of those songs was funny."

Dylan recorded around thirty new compositions with The Hawks, including some of the most celebrated songs of his career: "<a href="I%20Shall%20Be%20Released">I Shall Be Released</a>", "<a href="This%20Wheel%27s%20on%20Fire%20%28song%29">This Wheel's on Fire</a>", "<a href="Quinn%20the%20Eskimo%20%28The%20Mighty%20Quinn%29">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</a>", "<a href="Tears%20of%20Rage">Tears of Rage</a>" and "<a href="You%20Ain%27t%20Goin%27%20Nowhere">You Ain't Goin' Nowhere</a>". Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: "Now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse"?

One of the qualities of "The Basement Tapes" that sets it apart from contemporaneous works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the "<a href="Summer%20of%20Love">Summer of Love</a>" that produced <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>", their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released "Sgt. Pepper" which I didn't like at all. I thought that was a very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud."

<a href="Mike%20Marqusee">Mike Marqusee</a> describes how the basement recordings represented a radical change of direction for Dylan, who turned his back on his reputation for importing <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> ideas into popular culture: "At the very moment when avant-gardism was sweeping through new cultural corridors, Dylan decided to dismount. The dandified, aggressively modern surface was replaced by a self-consciously unassuming and traditional garb. The giddiness embodied, celebrated, dissected in the songs of the mid-sixties had left him exhausted. He sought safety in a retreat to the countryside that was also a retreat in time, or more precisely, a search for timelessness."

Dylan had married <a href="Sara%20Dylan">Sara Lownds</a> in November 1965. By the time the basement sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and <a href="Jesse%20Dylan">Jesse Dylan</a>. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink when it became clear that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of "The Basement Tapes", as Hudson said in "<a href="The%20Last%20Waltz">The Last Waltz</a>": "Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the screen door, wandering off into the woods with Hamlet [the dog Dylan shared with The Band] ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children." Several "Basement Tapes" songs, such as "Clothes Line Saga" and "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.

The intense collaboration between Dylan and The Hawks that produced the basement recordings came to an end in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> to record a formal studio album, "<a href="John%20Wesley%20Harding%20%28album%29">John Wesley Harding</a>", with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he received a phone call from Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and remembered that he "could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R&B. They had rubbed off on him a little."

Dylan referred to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>": "They weren't demos for myself, they were demos of the songs. I was being PUSHED again into coming up with some songs. You know how those things go." In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman. Acetates and tapes of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists.

Peter, Paul and Mary, managed by Grossman, had the first hit with a basement composition when their cover of "Too Much of Nothing" reached number 35 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" chart</a> in late 1967. <a href="Ian%20%26amp%3B%20Sylvia">Ian & Sylvia</a>, also managed by Grossman, recorded "Tears of Rage", "Quinn the Eskimo" and "This Wheel's on Fire". In January 1968, <a href="Manfred%20Mann">Manfred Mann</a> reached number one on the UK pop chart with their recording of "The Mighty Quinn". In April, "This Wheel's on Fire", recorded by <a href="Julie%20Driscoll%2C%20Brian%20Auger%20and%20the%20Trinity">Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity</a>, hit number five on the UK chart. That same month, a version of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" by <a href="The%20Byrds">The Byrds</a> was issued as a single. Along with "Nothing Was Delivered", it appeared on their country-rock album "<a href="Sweetheart%20of%20the%20Rodeo">Sweetheart of the Rodeo</a>", released in August. The Hawks, officially renamed The Band, recorded "This Wheel's on Fire", "I Shall Be Released" and "Tears of Rage" for their debut album, "<a href="Music%20from%20Big%20Pink">Music from Big Pink</a>", released in July 1968. <a href="Fairport%20Convention">Fairport Convention</a> covered "Million Dollar Bash" on their 1969 album "<a href="Unhalfbricking">Unhalfbricking</a>".

As tapes of Dylan's recordings circulated in the music industry, journalists became aware of their existence. In June 1968, Jann Wenner wrote a front-page "Rolling Stone" story headlined "Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released". Wenner listened to the fourteen-song demo and reported, "There is enough material—most all of it very good—to make an entirely new Bob Dylan album, a record with a distinct style of its own." He concluded, "Even though Dylan used one of the finest rock and roll bands ever assembled on the "Highway 61" album, here he works with his own band for the first time. Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll to his voice for the first time. If this were ever to be released it would be a classic."

Reporting such as this whetted the appetites of Dylan fans. In July 1969, the first rock <a href="Bootleg%20recording">bootleg</a> appeared in California, entitled "<a href="Great%20White%20Wonder">Great White Wonder</a>". The double album consisted of seven songs from the Woodstock basement sessions, plus some early recordings Dylan had made in Minneapolis in December 1961 and one track recorded from "<a href="The%20Johnny%20Cash%20Show">The Johnny Cash Show</a>". One of those responsible for the bootleg, identified only as Patrick, talked to "Rolling Stone": "Dylan is a heavy talent and he's got all those songs nobody's ever heard. We thought we'd take it upon ourselves to make this music available." The process of bootlegging Dylan's work would eventually see the illegal release of hundreds of live and studio recordings, and lead the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> to describe Dylan as the most bootlegged artist in the history of the music industry.

In January 1975, Dylan unexpectedly gave permission for the release of a selection of the basement recordings, perhaps because he and Grossman had resolved their legal dispute over the Dwarf Music copyrights on his songs. Clinton Heylin argues that Dylan was able to consent following the critical and commercial success of his album "<a href="Blood%20on%20the%20Tracks">Blood on the Tracks</a>", released that same month: "After "Blood on the Tracks", "The Basement Tapes" no longer had the status of a final reminder of Dylan's lost genius". In 1975, as well, The Band purchased Shangri-La ranch in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>, which they transformed into their recording studio.

Engineer Rob Fraboni was brought to Shangri-La to clean up the recordings still in the possession of Hudson, the original engineer. Fraboni had worked on Dylan's "<a href="Planet%20Waves">Planet Waves</a>" album, with backing by The Band, and the live Dylan–Band album "<a href="Before%20the%20Flood%20%28album%29">Before the Flood</a>", both released in 1974. Fraboni has described Robertson as the dominant voice in selecting the final tracks for "The Basement Tapes" and reported that Dylan was not in the studio very often. The stereo recordings made by Hudson were remixed to mono, while Robertson and other members of The Band overdubbed new keyboard, guitar, and drum parts onto some of the 1967 Woodstock recordings. According to Fraboni, four new songs by The Band were also recorded in preparation for the album's official release, one of which, a cover of <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a>'s "Going Back to Memphis", did not end up being included. There is disagreement about the recording date of the other three songs: "Bessie Smith", "Ain't No More Cane" and "Don't Ya Tell Henry". While Fraboni has recalled that The Band taped them in 1975, the liner notes for the reissued versions of The Band's own albums state that these songs were recorded between 1967 and 1970. Ultimately, eight of the twenty-four songs on "The Basement Tapes" did not feature Dylan, several of the studio outtakes postdating the sessions at Big Pink. In justifying their inclusion, Robertson explained that he, Hudson and Dylan did not have access to all the basement recordings: "We had access to some of the songs. Some of these things came under the heading of 'homemade' which meant a Basement Tape to us." Robertson has suggested that the Basement Tapes are, for him, "a process, a homemade feel" and so could include recordings from a wide variety of sources. "The idea," he said, "was to record some demos for other people. They were never intended to be a record, never meant to be presented. It was somewhat annoying that the songs were bootlegged. The album was finally released in the spirit of 'well, if this is going to be documented, let's at least make it good quality.'"

<a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> released "The Basement Tapes" on June 26, 1975. The album peaked at number seven on the "Billboard" chart, and reached number eight in the UK. It was acclaimed by critics. <a href="John%20Rockwell">John Rockwell</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" hailed it as "one of the greatest albums in the history of American popular music." "Rolling Stone"s <a href="Paul%20Nelson%20%28critic%29">Paul Nelson</a> called its contents "the hardest, toughest, sweetest, saddest, funniest, wisest songs I know". The review in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" declared, "He may perplex, irritate, and disappoint, but Dylan has to rank as the single greatest artist modern American pop music has produced." "The Basement Tapes" topped the "Voice"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop Critics Poll</a>. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, the poll's creator and supervisor, said the recordings sounded richer and stranger in 1975 than when they were made and concluded, "We don't have to bow our heads in shame because this is the best album of 1975. It would have been the best album of 1967, too."

Criticism of the 1975 official release of "The Basement Tapes" has centered on two issues: the recordings by The Band on their own, and the selection of the Dylan songs. In his book about the basement sessions, <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> describes the album's contents as "sixteen basement recordings plus eight Band demos". Critic <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a> writes of the album, "The interspersed tracks by The Band alone merely disrupt the unity of Dylan material, much more of which should have been included. Key songs missing here include 'I Shall Be Released' and 'The Mighty Quinn'". Heylin similarly argues that compiler Robbie Robertson did Dylan fans "a major disservice" by omitting those two songs as well as "I'm Not There" and "Sign On The Cross". He writes, "The album as released hardly gave a real idea of what they had been doing in Woodstock. Not even the two traditional songs pulled to the master reels—'Young But Daily Growin' and 'The Banks Of The Royal Canal'—made the final twenty-four cuts." <a href="Sasha%20Frere-Jones">Sasha Frere-Jones</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", on the other hand, said of the 1975 release that, in comparison to the complete recordings released in 2011, "Robertson, with some exceptions, knew which the good songs were" and was right to clean up the recordings.

The authenticity of the 1975 album was questioned by a reviewer of the remastered version of The Band's "Music from Big Pink", issued in 2000. Dave Hopkins noted that "Katie's Been Gone", which appears as a bonus track on the "Big Pink" reissue, is the same recording that appeared on "The Basement Tapes", but now "in stereo and with improved sound quality beyond what the remastering process alone would provide". Hopkins declared, "The cat's out of the bag: 'Katie' and the other Band-only tracks on "The Basement Tapes" must have been intentionally muddied in the studio in 1975 so that they would fit better alongside the Dylan material recorded in the basement with a home reel-to-reel." Heylin also takes exception to Robertson's passing off The Band's songs as originating from the basement sessions. By including eight Band recordings to Dylan's sixteen, he says, "Robertson sought to imply that the alliance between Dylan and The Band was far more equal than it was: 'Hey, we were writing all these songs, doing our own thing, oh and Bob would sometimes come around and we'd swap a few tunes.'" Heylin asserts that "though revealing in their own right, The Band tracks only pollute the official set and reduce its stature."

Barney Hoskyns describes "Heylin's objections [as] the academic ones of a touchy Dylanologist: "The Basement Tapes" still contained some of the greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song." Of The Band's version of "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break."

By 1975, Dylan showed scant interest in the discographical minutiae of the recordings. Interviewed on the radio by <a href="Mary%20Travers">Mary Travers</a>, he recalled, "We were all up there sorta drying out ... making music and watching time go by. So, in the meantime, we made this record. Actually, it wasn't a record, it was just songs which we'd come to this basement and recorded. Out in the woods..." Heylin has commented that Dylan seemed to "dismiss the work as unfinished therapy".

Although "The Basement Tapes" reached the public in an unorthodox manner, officially released eight years after the songs were recorded, critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan's development. Michael Gray writes, "The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between ... two utterly different albums. They evince the same highly serious, precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the "John Wesley Harding" collection—yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as "Blonde on Blonde". 'Tears of Rage', for example, is an exact halfway house between, say, '<a href="One%20of%20Us%20Must%20Know%20%28Sooner%20or%20Later%29">One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)</a>' and '<a href="I%20Dreamed%20I%20Saw%20St.%20Augustine">I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine</a>'".

Singer-songwriter <a href="David%20Gray%20%28musician%29">David Gray</a> commented that the great achievement of "The Basement Tapes" is that Dylan found a way out of the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as "Blonde on Blonde": "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like something out of the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">Gold Rush</a> and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic <a href="Mike%20Marqusee">Mike Marqusee</a>, "but with a much gentler touch than in "Blonde on Blonde". In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal."

Robert Shelton has argued that "The Basement Tapes" revolves around two sets of themes. One group of songs is "tinctured with the search for salvation": "I Shall Be Released" (on the demo, but not on the album), "Too Much of Nothing", "Nothing Was Delivered", "This Wheel's On Fire", "Tears of Rage" and "Goin' To Acapulco". "'Nothing' and 'nowhere' perplex and nag" in these songs, he writes. "The 'nothing' echoes the artist's dilemma: death versus life, vacuum versus harvest, isolation versus people, silence versus sound, the void versus the life-impulse." A second group, comprising "songs of joy, signaling some form of deliverance", includes most of the remaining songs in the collection.

In his sleeve notes for the 1975 release of "The Basement Tapes", Greil Marcus wrote, "What was taking place as Dylan and The Band fiddled with the tunes, was less a style than a spirit—a spirit that had to do with a delight in friendship and invention." He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: "The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's '<a href="Mystery%20Train">Mystery Train</a>' or <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Robert Johnson</a>'s '<a href="Love%20In%20Vain">Love In Vain</a>."

In 1997, after listening to more than 100 basement recordings issued on various bootlegs, Marcus extended these insights into a book-length study, "<a href="Invisible%20Republic">Invisible Republic</a>" (reissued in 2001 under the title "The Old, Weird America"). In it, he quotes Robertson's memory of the recording: "[Dylan] would pull these songs out of nowhere. We didn't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn't tell." Marcus calls the songs "palavers with a community of ghosts. ... These ghosts were not abstractions. As native sons and daughters they were a community. And they were once gathered in a single place: on the "<a href="Anthology%20of%20American%20Folk%20Music">Anthology of American Folk Music</a>"". A collection of blues and country music recorded in the 1920s and 1930s, the "Anthology"—compiled by <a href="Harry%20Everett%20Smith">Harry Smith</a> and originally released by <a href="Folkways%20Records">Folkways Records</a> in 1952—was a major influence on the <a href="American%20folk%20music%20revival">folk music revival</a> of the 1950s and the 1960s. Marcus suggests that Dylan's "Basement Tapes" shared with Smith's "Anthology" a sense of alchemy, "and in the alchemy is an undiscovered country".

While removed from the public's gaze, Dylan and The Band made music very different from the recordings of other major artists. Andy Gill writes, "Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the <a href="long%2C%20hot%20summer%20of%201967">long, hot summer of 1967</a> was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of '<a href="Psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic</a>' music—mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos." Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: "While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> was testifying that life went on <a href="Within%20You%20Without%20You">within and without you</a>, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> was <a href="2000%20Light%20Years%20from%20Home">2,000 light years from home</a>, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots."

This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, "<a href="John%20Wesley%20Harding%20%28album%29">John Wesley Harding</a>", in <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a> songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer <a href="Bob%20Johnston">Bob Johnston</a> recalled, "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." Dylan summed up the gap: "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads."

When The Band began work on their debut album, "Music from Big Pink", in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, "We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique." That technique influenced groups including The Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Get Back</a>" sessions in early 1969 an effort to record "in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that The Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes".

"Listening to "The Basement Tapes" now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called <a href="Americana%20%28music%29">Americana</a> or <a href="Alternative%20country">alt.country</a>," wrote <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a>. "The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are "The Basement Tapes". Remember that "The Basement Tapes" holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, "If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—<a href="Mercury%20Rev">Mercury Rev</a>, <a href="Cowboy%20Junkies">Cowboy Junkies</a>, <a href="Wilco">Wilco</a>, <a href="The%20Waterboys">The Waterboys</a>—have since tried to get back to that place."

For <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a>, "The Basement Tapes" "sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs—because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these."

In 2016, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked "The Basement Tapes" number 292 on its list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that "Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling—and all of it taps into centuries of American song".

Between 1985 and 2013, Columbia issued five additional 1967 recordings by Dylan from Big Pink: take 2 of "<a href="Quinn%20the%20Eskimo%20%28The%20Mighty%20Quinn%29">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</a>" on "<a href="Biograph%20%28album%29">Biograph</a>" in 1985, "I Shall Be Released" and "<a href="Santa-Fe%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20song%29">Santa-Fe</a>" on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>" in 1991, "I'm Not There (1956)" on the <a href="I%27m%20Not%20There%20%28soundtrack%29">"I'm Not There" soundtrack</a> in 2007, and "Minstrel Boy" on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Vol.%2010%20%E2%80%93%20Another%20Self%20Portrait%20%281969%E2%80%931971%29">The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 – Another Self Portrait (1969–1971)</a>" in 2013. In the early 1970s, Dylan released new recordings of five compositions from The Basement Tape era: live performances of "Minstrel Boy" and "Quinn the Eskimo" from the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight%20Festival%201969">Isle of Wight Festival</a> on August 31, 1969, appeared on "<a href="Self%20Portrait%20%28Bob%20Dylan%20album%29">Self Portrait</a>", and October 1971 recordings with <a href="Happy%20Traum">Happy Traum</a> of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere", "I Shall Be Released" and "Down in the Flood" appeared on "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%27s%20Greatest%20Hits%20Vol.%20II">Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II</a>".

In 2005, The Band compilation "<a href="A%20Musical%20History">A Musical History</a>" was released, which includes the 1967 Woodstock Band recordings "Words and Numbers", "You Don't Come Through", "Caledonia Mission", "Ferdinand the Imposter" and "Will the Circle Be Unbroken". In 1968, The Band re-recorded "This Wheel's on Fire", "Tears of Rage", "I Shall Be Released" and "Caledonia Mission" in studios in New York and Los Angeles for "Music From Big Pink". Versions of other Band Basement Tape compositions, recorded in various locations between 1967 and possibly 1975, appear on "<a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20%28album%29">Across the Great Divide</a>" and "A Musical History", and as bonus tracks on the 2000 reissues of "Music From Big Pink" and "<a href="Cahoots%20%28album%29">Cahoots</a>". Live versions by The Band of various Basement Tapes songs have also been issued: "I Shall Be Released" on "<a href="Before%20the%20Flood%20%28album%29">Before the Flood</a>"; "Caledonia Mission" and "This Wheel's On Fire" on "<a href="Rock%20of%20Ages%20%28album%29">Rock of Ages</a>", with "I Shall Be Released", "Down in the Flood" and "Don't Ya Tell Henry" appearing on the album's 2001 reissue; "I Shall Be Released" on "<a href="The%20Last%20Waltz%20%281978%20album%29">The Last Waltz</a>" and "This Wheel's On Fire" on the <a href="The%20Last%20Waltz%20%282002%20album%29">2002 box set release of the album</a>; "I Shall Be Released" and "Don't Ya Tell Henry" on "<a href="Live%20at%20Watkins%20Glen">Live at Watkins Glen</a>"; and "Ain't No Cane on the Brazos" recorded live at the <a href="Woodstock%20Festival">Woodstock Festival</a> in August 1969, on "Across the Great Divide".

On March 31, 2009, <a href="Legacy%20Records">Legacy Records</a> issued a remastered version of the original 1975 "Basement Tapes" double album, which critics praised for its improved sound quality. According to reviewer Scott Hreha, there was "something about the remastering that makes it feel more like an official album—the earlier CD version’s weak fidelity unfairly emphasized the 'basement' nature of the recordings, where it now possesses a clarity that belies its humble and informal origins."

In the early 1990s, a virtually complete collection of all of Dylan's 1967 recordings in Woodstock was released on a bootleg five-CD set, "The Genuine Basement Tapes". The collection, which contains <a href="List%20of%20Basement%20Tapes%20songs">over 100 songs and alternate takes</a>, was later remastered and issued as the four-CD bootleg "A Tree With Roots". On November 4, 2014, Columbia/Legacy issued "", an official 6-CD box set containing 139 tracks which comprises nearly all of Dylan's basement recordings, including 30 never-bootlegged tracks. A companion 2-CD set containing highlights from the recordings, "The Basement Tapes Raw", was also released.

1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident

The 1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident, sometimes referred to as the Black Hawk Incident, was a <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incident over northern <a href="History%20of%20Iraq%20under%20Ba%27athist%20rule">Iraq</a> that occurred on 14 April 1994 during <a href="Operation%20Provide%20Comfort">Operation Provide Comfort</a> (OPC). The pilots of two <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">F-15</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>, operating under the control of a USAF <a href="airborne%20warning%20and%20control%20system">airborne warning and control system</a> (AWACS) aircraft, misidentified two <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">UH-60 Black Hawk</a> <a href="helicopters">helicopters</a> as Iraqi <a href="Mil%20Mi-24">Mil Mi-24</a> "Hind" helicopters. The F-15 pilots fired on and destroyed both helicopters, killing all 26 military and civilians aboard, including personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, France, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and the <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurdish</a> community.

A subsequent USAF investigation blamed the accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, the crew members of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the <a href="identification%20friend%20or%20foe">identification friend or foe</a> (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.

As a result of complaints by family members of the victims and others that the military was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House</a> conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, <a href="Ronald%20R.%20Fogleman">Ronald R. Fogleman</a>, the USAF's new <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff</a>, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.

Fogleman's investigation led to several of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers to be interviewed for the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.

On 7 April 1991, Iraq accepted United Nations (UN) cease-fire conditions and resolutions, thereby officially ending the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 <a href="Kurds">Kurdish</a> refugees who had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, <a href="John%20Shalikashvili">John Shalikashvili</a> took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called <a href="Operation%20Provide%20Comfort">Operation Provide Comfort</a> (OPC).

OPC took place in an area of northern Iraq above the <a href="36th%20parallel%20north">36th parallel</a>. This area, approximately in size, was designated a <a href="no-fly%20zone">"no-fly" security zone</a> by UN coalition forces, enforced by a combined task force (CTF) of daily armed aircraft patrols from participating nations, including the United Kingdom, France, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and the United States. The <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> was tasked with assisting civilian relief agencies to build communities and facilities for the Kurds in Northern Iraq. Over the next three years, 27,000 fixed-wing and 1,400 helicopter coalition flights took place in the zone to support humanitarian operations without interference from Iraqi aircraft or other military units.

In April 1994 OPC was co-commanded by USAF <a href="Brigadier%20general">Brigadier General</a> Jeffrey Pilkington. The OPC combined air forces were commanded by Colonel <a href="Curtis%20H.%20Emery">Curtis H. Emery</a>, USAF. Colonel Douglas J. Richardson, USAF, was the director of operations for the combined air forces.

On 14 April 1994, at <a href="24-hour%20clock">07:36</a> local time, a USAF <a href="E-3%20Sentry">E-3 AWACS</a> aircraft from the <a href="963d%20Airborne%20Air%20Control%20Squadron">963d Airborne Air Control Squadron</a> (based at <a href="Tinker%20Air%20Force%20Base">Tinker Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>) departed <a href="Incirlik%20Air%20Base">Incirlik Air Base</a> (AB), Turkey in support of OPC. The AWACS, with its 19-member crew under the mission crew command of Major Lawrence Tracy, was to provide airborne threat warning and air control for all OPC aircraft during its time aloft. The AWACS crew reported on station at its assigned surveillance orbit altitude of located inside Turkey just north of the northern border of Iraq at 08:45. The weather that day was fair and clear over northern Iraq.

At 08:22, two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the 6th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (based in <a href="Giebelstadt">Giebelstadt</a>, Germany), called Eagle Flight, departed <a href="Diyarbak%C4%B1r">Diyarbakır</a>, near <a href="Pirin%C3%A7lik%20Air%20Base">Pirinçlik Air Base</a>, Turkey headed for the OPC military coordination center (MCC) located away in <a href="Zakho">Zakhu</a>, Iraq. Both helicopters were fitted with external, fuel tanks on sponsons mounted beside each side door with each tank emblazoned with large <a href="flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">American flags</a>. In addition to the flags on the fuel tanks, each helicopter was marked with American flags on each side door, on the nose, and on the belly. The lead Black Hawk was piloted by U.S. Army <a href="Captain%20%28OF-2%29">Captain</a> Patrick McKenna, commander of the Eagle Flight detachment of six helicopters.

At 09:21, the Black Hawks reported their entry into the no-fly zone by radio on the en route frequency to the AWACS en route controller, Lieutenant Joseph Halcli, and then landed six minutes later at the MCC. Halcli and his superior officer, Captain Jim Wang, the AWACS's senior director, added "friendly helicopter" <a href="symbol">tags</a> to their <a href="radar">radar</a> scopes, noted that both helicopters were displaying <a href="identification%20friend%20or%20foe">identification friend or foe</a> (IFF) Mode I and Mode II signals, and then suspended the radar symbols after the Black Hawks disappeared from their scopes upon landing at the MCC at 09:24. Although the helicopters were squawking (signalling) the wrong IFF Mode I code for the no-fly zone (called the <a href="Tactical%20Area%20of%20Responsibility">Tactical Area of Responsibility</a> or TAOR), neither Wang nor Halcli informed the Black Hawk pilots of that (both helicopters, however, were squawking the correct Mode II codes). Wang and Halcli also neglected to direct the Black Hawks to begin using the TAOR radio frequency instead of the en route frequency.
At the MCC, the Black Hawks picked up 16 members of the UN Provide Comfort coalition leadership team including four Kurdish civilians, one <a href="Chaldean%20Christians">Chaldean-Catholic</a> civilian, three Turkish, two British, and one French military officers, plus five U.S. civilian and military officials. At 09:54, the helicopters departed the MCC for <a href="Erbil">Erbil</a>, Iraq, a distance of . The Black Hawks reported their departure, flight route, and destinations by radio which was acknowledged by Halcli. Halcli then re-initiated the friendly helicopter track on his scope. Two of the Black Hawk passengers were <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Jerry Thompson, U.S. Army, commander of the MCC, and his replacement, Colonel Richard Mulhern, U.S. Army. At Arbil and later at Salah ad Din, Iraq, Thompson planned to introduce Mulhern to two prominent Kurdish leaders, <a href="Masoud%20Barzani">Masoud Barzani</a> and <a href="Jalal%20Talabani">Jalal Talabani</a>, as well as to UN representatives. Halcli placed tags on his radar screen to show the two Black Hawks' track and notified Wang of the helicopters' movement. In addition to Halcli's screen, the friendly helicopter symbols were visible on the radar screens of Wang, Tracy, and USAF Major Doug Martin. Martin was the "Duke" or "ACE" airborne command element on the AWACS, meaning that he was a rated aircrew member assigned to the crew to ensure that all engagement (combat) mandates were adhered to and executed as written in OPC policies.

En route to Arbil, at 10:12, the Black Hawks entered mountainous terrain and their radar returns disappeared from the AWACS's scopes. Captain Dierdre Bell, an air surveillance officer on the AWACS, noticed that the Black Hawks' radar and IFF returns had disappeared and sent an electronic "attention arrow" to Wang's scope. Wang took no action and the large blinking green arrow automatically disappeared from his screen after one minute.
Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter aircraft from the <a href="53d%20Fighter%20Squadron">53d Fighter Squadron</a>, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their mission was to perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) that was supposed to list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.

At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, reported entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller responsible for air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using was different from the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired to the back of the airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.
At 10:22, Wickson, flying at , reported a radar contact on a low-flying, slow-moving aircraft southeast of his current position. Wilson acknowledged Wickson's report with a "clear there" response, meaning that he had no radar contacts in that area. Unknown to the two F-15 pilots, the unidentified aircraft were the two U.S. Army Black Hawks. Contrary to standard procedure, neither Tracy nor Wang spoke up at this point to request that the AWACS crew members attempt to identify the F-15s' radar contacts.

Both F-15 pilots then electronically interrogated the radar target with their on-board IFF systems across two different modes (Mode I and Mode IV). Their IFF systems responded negatively to the attempt to identify the contact on Mode I. The Mode IV momentarily gave a positive response, but thereafter responded negatively and the F-15s moved to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Intermittent IFF Mode I and Mode II returns from the Black Hawks now began to show on Wilson's and other AWACS crew members' scopes and friendly helicopter symbols reappeared on Wang's scope. After closing to of the radar contacts, at 10:25 the F-15s again reported the contact to the AWACS and Wilson this time responded that he now had a radar contact at that reported location. Although the Black Hawk intermittent radar and now steady IFF returns on the AWACS scopes were in the same location as the unidentified contacts being tracked by the F-15s, none of the AWACS controllers advised Wickson or May that the contacts they were tracking might be friendly helicopters.

The two F-15s now initiated a visual identification (VID) pass of the contact. The VID pass entailed violating one of OPC's <a href="rules%20of%20engagement">rules of engagement</a>, which prohibited fighter aircraft from operating below above the ground. At this time the two Black Hawks had entered a deep valley and were cruising at a speed of about above the ground. Wickson's VID pass was conducted at a speed of about , above and to the left of the helicopters. At 10:28 Wickson reported "Tally 2 Hinds" and then passed the two Black Hawks. "Hind" is the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> <a href="NATO%20reporting%20name">designation</a> for the <a href="Mil%20Mi-24">Mil Mi-24</a> helicopter, a helicopter that the Iraqi and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>n militaries operated and was usually configured with armament on small, side-mounted wings. Wilson responded with "Copy, Hinds" and asked Wang, "Sir, are you listening to this?" Wang responded, "Affirmative" but offered no further guidance or comments.

May then conducted his own VID pass about above the helicopters and reported, "Tally 2." May later stated to a USAF accident investigation board that his "Tally 2" call meant that he saw two helicopters but did not mean that he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds. Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, "I had no doubt when I looked at him that he was a Hind... . The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind."

Following their VID passes, Wickson and May circled back behind the helicopters approximately . Because aircraft from various nations sometimes operated unannounced in the northern Iraq area, the OPC rules of engagement required the F-15 pilots to attempt to verify the nationality of the helicopters. Instead, at 10:28, Wickson notified the AWACS that he and May were "engaged" and instructed May to "arm hot." At 10:30, Wickson fired an <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a> missile at the trail helicopter from a range of about . The missile hit and destroyed the trailing helicopter seven seconds later (). In response, the lead Black Hawk, piloted by McKenna, immediately turned left and dived for lower altitude in an apparent attempt to evade the unexpected attack. About 20 seconds later, May fired an <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a> missile at the lead helicopter from a range of about , hitting and shooting it down also about northeast of the trail helicopter (). All 26 people on board the two Black Hawks were killed. After flying over the wreckage of the two helicopters lying burning on the ground, May radioed Wickson, "Stick a fork in them, they're done."

By 13:15 local time, Kurdish civilians notified the MCC that they had witnessed the two Black Hawks being shot down north of Arbil and that there were no survivors. The news was quickly picked up by the media and broadcast by <a href="Cable%20News%20Network">CNN</a>.

Within hours, U.S. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> was briefed on the shootdown and called the heads of government of the United Kingdom and France, <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>, to express regret and sympathy for the deaths of their citizens in the incident. Clinton then appeared a few hours later in a televised news conference in which he stated that he had directed the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> (DoD) to lead an inquiry into the accident. Clinton further stated, "We will get the facts, and we will make them available to the American people and to the people of Britain, France, and Turkey, our partners in Operation Provide Comfort."

General <a href="Robert%20C.%20Oaks">Robert C. Oaks</a>, USAF, Commander of <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Forces%20in%20Europe">United States Air Forces in Europe</a>, immediately appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 accident investigation board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.

After interviewing 137 witnesses and conducting numerous tests, the 27-volume, 3,630-page AFR 110-14 investigation report was publicly released on 13 July 1994, although some report's details had been leaked to the media by unknown defense officials two weeks earlier. The board made seven general findings about what they believed caused the shootdown to occur:
The board report stated that, "There is no indication that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots." Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed that they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, "I cannot tell you that. I honestly don't know." When Wang was asked the same question by the investigators, he replied, "No one is responsible." When the investigators asked Martin what action he took when the F-15s called a visual identification on two Hind helicopters, Martin stated, "I did nothing."

The board found that combined OPC forces, led by Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and other USAF officers, had failed to integrate helicopters into aircraft operations in the TAOR. An Eagle Flight officer later testified that he had been told by the CTF's chief of staff, a USAF officer, that the army Black Hawk unit was not considered to be part of OPC. Thus, the CTF staff, under the direction of Colonel James Rusty O'Brien, USAF, had not tried to coordinate the U.S. Army Black Hawk missions into the daily ATOs. In fact, neither O'Brien nor his predecessors had established any type of procedure for communicating information on Black Hawk missions to the Combined Forces Air Component (CFAC). The MCC commander, Colonel Thompson, had personally called O'Brien on the night of 13 April to tell him about the next day's Black Hawk mission into northern Iraq, a mission that had been specifically and personally approved by Pilkington earlier that day. O'Brien or his staff apparently did not attempt to communicate specific information on this mission to the AWACS or F-15 fighter units at Incirlik, the CFAC, the ground-based mission director, or to the "Duke" on board the AWACS.
For reasons that USAF officers were unable to explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating for almost two years in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.

The board did not investigate whether any USAF institutional factors, such as a lack of <a href="crew%20resource%20management">crew resource management</a> training for the involved aircrews, might have been a factor. Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.

The United States Secretary of Defense, <a href="William%20Perry">William Perry</a>, later summarized the "errors, omissions, and failures" contributing to the accident as, "The F-15 pilots misidentified the Black Hawks, the AWACS crew failed to intervene, Eagle Flight and their operations were not integrated into the Task Force, and the IFF systems failed." General Shalikashvili, now serving as <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, added that, "There were a shocking number of instances where people failed to do their job properly."

On 8 September 1994 the DoD announced the actions it would take in response to the investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an <a href="Article%2032%20hearing">Article 32 hearing</a> in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.
Martin and Halcli waived their rights to the Article 32 hearing, meaning that their cases could move immediately to <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> or administrative action. Wickson was given immunity by USAF <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> Eugene Santarelli, commander of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Air%20Force">17th Air Force</a>, to testify at the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at <a href="Tinker%20Air%20Force%20Base">Tinker Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> was an open hearing and presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">8th Air Force</a>. May's hearing, beginning on 7 November 1994 at <a href="Sembach%20Air%20Base">Sembach Air Base</a>, Germany was a closed hearing and presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests to testify at either hearing.

On 17 November 1994 the USAF announced that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive <a href="nonjudicial%20punishment">nonjudicial</a> administrative action on the dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered <a href="nonjudicial%20punishment">Article 15</a> action.

At his hearing, May changed his testimony from what he gave to the accident investigation board, stating that he "had" positively identified the two helicopters as Iraqi Hinds. Brigadier General John R. Dallager, an F-15 pilot and Wickson's and May's wing commander (<a href="52nd%20Fighter%20Wing">52nd Fighter Wing</a>) and regimental court-martial 303 inquiry officer, stated that he found May's errors in the shootdown "reasonable." Starr recommended that the charges against May be dropped, stating that he found May's testimony to be believable. On 27 December 1994 the USAF announced that Santarelli, an F-15 pilot, had dismissed the charges against May and had decided not to pursue criminal disciplinary actions against any other OPC personnel under his legal jurisdiction, including Wickson, Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien. In January 1995 a USAF flying board returned Wickson and May, who had been grounded since the incident, to flying status. Subsequently, Wickson was transferred to <a href="Randolph%20Air%20Force%20Base">Randolph Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, to undergo instructor pilot training with a follow-on assignment to <a href="Columbus%20Air%20Force%20Base">Columbus Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>.
The USAF later announced the administrative actions taken against the other personnel involved in the shootdown. Pilkington, Emery, and Richardson received letters of admonishment. Martin, May, O'Brien, Tracy, Wickson, and Wilson received <a href="letter%20of%20reprimand">letters of reprimand</a>. Halcli accepted an Article 15 action which resulted in his receiving a letter of reprimand. The personnel involved were allowed to petition for the removal of the letters from their records at a future time. The reprimands were placed in "unfavorable information files" for each individual and were normally removed after two years. General <a href="George%20Joulwan">George Joulwan</a>, U.S. Army, <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">Supreme Allied Commander, Europe</a>, removed Pilkington as commander of OPC but the USAF retained him as commander of the <a href="86th%20Airlift%20Wing">86th Airlift Wing</a> at <a href="Ramstein%20Air%20Base">Ramstein Air Base</a>, Germany. O'Brien and Emery were transferred to <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">staff</a> positions at the <a href="The%20Pentagon">Pentagon</a>. Richardson was transferred to a staff position at <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe</a>. Emery had been promoted to brigadier general on 15 July 1994 and his promotion was allowed to stand.

Wang's court-martial took place, beginning on 2 June 1995, at Tinker Air Force Base. Wang was tried on three counts of dereliction of duty. Most of the personnel involved in the incident, except May, were called to testify, including the AWACS crew members, Wickson, and Pilkington. Most of the 40 witnesses testified with a grant of immunity.

During the trial, evidence was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions. In fact, the problem was considered serious enough that the military had referred Wang to medical authorities to be checked for <a href="narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a>. Wang had also previously failed two check rides.

Pilkington, an <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16</a> pilot, testified that as commander of OPC he had sent numerous aircrew members, the majority of them F-15 pilots, back to their home bases for violating OPC rules or procedures or for displaying a lack of good judgment. In response to questions on the F-15 pilot's actions resulting in the shootdown, Pilkington stated, "I don't understand and I will probably never understand Wickson's mindset." When asked if Wickson and May violated OPC rules of engagement in the incident, Pilkington responded, "Yes." AWACS crew members added in their testimonies that once Wickson and May visually identified the helicopters as hostile, all responsibility for the shootdown passed to the F-15 pilots.
Frank Spinner, Wang's civilian attorney, argued that <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF Chief of Staff</a> General <a href="Merrill%20McPeak">Merrill McPeak</a>, a career fighter pilot, had made clear that he did not want Wickson and May punished for their actions in the shootdown. Cited as evidence for this was a "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" report, published also in the European "<a href="Stars%20and%20Stripes%20%28newspaper%29">Stars and Stripes</a>" newspaper on 18 June 1994 that stated that McPeak "strongly opposed" court-martial action for Wickson or May. Pilkington stated that he had heard rumors that McPeak had said something to that effect, but could not confirm if they were true or not.

On 20 June 1995 the USAF announced a "nullification" verdict by Wang's 10-member court-martial jury, effectively acquitting Wang of the charges. Nullification is not a finding of innocence, but instead it is a refusal to convict on the stated charges. After the verdict, Wang stated, "I want to say the fight is nowhere near over for me. I want a congressional hearing or investigation into why I was the only person charged." Major General Nolan Sklute, the USAF's top legal officer, stated, "An incident like this does not necessarily mean that the conduct of all those involved rises to the level of criminal culpability. I'm satisfied with the handling of the case." <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Air%20Force">Secretary of the Air Force</a> <a href="Sheila%20Widnall">Sheila Widnall</a> added, "The Black Hawk helicopters were downed as a result of a tragic series of errors and unfortunate events involving numerous people. The mishap was not the result of any one individual's actions; the conduct of numerous officers and the system itself contributed."

On 17 July 1995, <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="William%20V.%20Roth%2C%20Jr.">William Roth</a>, chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs%20Permanent%20Subcommittee%20on%20Investigations">Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</a>, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from family members of the shootdown victims that it appeared that the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown. Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives'</a> <a href="United%20States%20House%20Armed%20Services%20Subcommittee%20on%20Military%20Personnel">Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel</a> scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, <a href="Ronald%20R.%20Fogleman">Ronald R. Fogleman</a> begin his own review of accountability for the incident.

The House Committee on National Security hearing on 3 August was presided over by Congressman <a href="Bob%20Dornan">Bob Dornan</a> and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus explained how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, "Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. You would never fire until you know what you are shooting at." Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.
On 10 August 1995 Fogleman spoke at a press conference at the Pentagon in which he announced the conclusions reached by his review into the accountability of USAF personnel involved in the shootdown incident. He stated that his investigation found that not all the performance evaluations for the individuals involved in the shootdown reflected the fact that they had received administrative action related to the incident. Fogleman stated, 

Fogleman then announced that he had directed that Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson be disqualified from aviation service duties for at least three years. Also, Fogleman wrote and placed "letters of evaluation" in the permanent personnel files of Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, Wilson, Pilkington, and Emery that stated that each had failed "to meet Air Force standards in job knowledge, judgment and leadership". In addition, a <a href="military%20decoration">military decoration</a> awarded to O'Brien for his service during OPC was rescinded. A videotape in which Fogleman described his actions related to the incident and his views on standards and accountability was distributed throughout the USAF and all USAF officers, senior <a href="non-commissioned%20officers">non-commissioned officers</a>, and <a href="Senior%20Executive%20Service">Senior Executive Service</a> civilians were ordered to view it. Fogleman further stated that he had found that the military justice system had "worked as it was designed to work".

Beginning in September 1995 and continuing for more than one year, Roth's Senate inquiry into the shootdown, led by Eric Thorson, investigated the incident. Thorson later stated his belief that the USAF accident investigation report and subsequent proceedings had been manipulated in order to avoid holding Wickson and May accountable for their actions. Thorson also stated that he believed that Starr had submitted an inaccurate and misleading report on May's Article 32 hearing to the USAF commanding officers, including Dallager and Santarelli. With regard to the AWACS personnel, Thorson added that, "We know some of the AWACS crew were incompetent beyond belief, and there is more than adequate evidence to conclude that several crewmembers were grossly negligent."

In August 1996, Roth's investigation board asked the DoD to produce the last four witnesses it wished to interview: Santarelli, Starr, Dallager, and Colonel C. G. Mangin. Mangin was Santarelli's legal adviser during the Wickson and May inquiry. The DoD refused the request to provide access to the four officers. A short time later, John White, <a href="United%20States%20Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense</a>, wrote a letter to Roth in which he asked that those four officers not be <a href="Deposition%20%28law%29">deposed</a>.

After further refusals from the USAF and DoD to provide the four officers for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a>s directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.
On 13 November 1996 the day the first subpoenaed USAF officer was scheduled to appear, the DoD delivered a letter to Roth, signed by its <a href="general%20counsel">general counsel</a>, Judith Miller, stating that the DoD believed the subpoenas were invalid because they were issued "after the <a href="Adjournment%20sine%20die">adjournment of "sine die"</a> of the <a href="104th%20United%20States%20Congress">104th Congress</a>" and was therefore not going to honor the subpoenas by providing the four officers for interview. Roth replied to the DoD that only the Senate's legal counsel could determine the validity of congressional subpoenas because of the "<a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>" principle in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> and thus, the subpoenas were valid. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter signed by Miller again refused to produce the witnesses. Roth, whose committee chairmanship was scheduled to end the next month, was told by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> that the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a>, <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a>, would not support him if he chose to take the dispute with the DoD to court. Also, many of Roth's senate colleagues, including <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, were asking him to "back off". Thus, Roth decided to drop the matter and continue preparing the report without the testimony of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. For the first time in U.S. history, the DoD had refused to comply with a U.S. Senate subpoena.

In January 1997 U.S. Senator <a href="Fred%20Thompson">Fred Thompson</a> became chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and terminated the Black Hawk investigation. The senate investigation report was never publicly released. Asked in 2001 about the DoD's refusal to honor the Senate subpoenas, Thorson responded, "Basically they told the United States Senate to go to hell."

In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, chaired by <a href="Bob%20Dornan">Bob Dornan</a>, requested that the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked to determine if the USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.

The GAO released its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation determined that the USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS as required by the ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.

The GAO investigation also uncovered evidence that a rivalry between F-15 and F-16 pilots may have contributed to Wickson's and May's "urgency to engage hostile aircraft" but was not discussed in the USAF investigation. During the GAO's investigation, USAF OPC officers confirmed that the rivalry between the F-15 and F-16 communities was particularly pronounced and intense partly due to the fact that F-16 aircraft had scored all the air-to-air combat kills in Iraq and <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia</a> since the end of the Gulf War. Pilkington stated to the GAO that, "the shootdown pilots' haste was due in part to the planned entry of two F-16s into the TAOR 10 to 15 minutes after the F-15s and that if the F-15 pilots had involved the chain of command, the pace would have slowed down, ruining the pilots' chances for a shootdown." The GAO concluded that if the evidence of a lack of mission discipline by Wickson and May had been included in the USAF report, such information "could have been useful in subsequent administrative and disciplinary actions."

Another aspect that the GAO investigation revealed was that the training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.

The GAO found no evidence of improper or unlawful command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.

On 26 August 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would pay US$100,000 (ex gratia) in compensation to the families of each of the non-U.S. personnel killed in the incident. At this time, the U.S. government, citing the <a href="Feres%20v.%20United%20States">Feres precedent</a>, did not offer compensation to the families of the U.S. victims. This was the first time that the U.S. had offered compensation to the victims of a friendly fire incident.

In 1998, Congressman <a href="Lamar%20S.%20Smith">Lamar S. Smith</a>, chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Judiciary%20Subcommittee%20on%20Immigration%2C%20Border%20Security%2C%20and%20Claims">Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims</a>, held hearings on the compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members. In November 1999 the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing payment of compensation to the families of the American Black Hawk victims.

Five days after the shootdown, USAF OPC officials began including Black Hawk flight times in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight. OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 fixed-wing and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to occur during the operation.

Wickson resigned and May retired from the USAF soon after Fogleman's investigation was completed. Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option. By May 2005, Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion. Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, "Jim (Wang) and all of us at first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something because it had been ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions."

Andrus retired from the USAF in 1995, Pilkington in 1996, Emery in 1997, and Santarelli in 1998, all at the same rank they held at the time of the shootdown, except Emery, who retired as a brigadier general. Richardson was promoted to brigadier general on 1 July 1999 and retired on 1 September 2001. Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">USAF Academy</a> in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August of the same year. Dallager's appointment and promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and refusal to testify for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1 September 2003, but at the rank of major general.

A monument to the 26 victims of the shootdown was constructed at Giebelstadt Army Airfield, Germany and dedicated on 14 April 1996. After U.S. military presence ceased at Giebelstadt, due to base closures, the monument was moved to <a href="Fort%20Rucker">Fort Rucker</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> on 10 March 2006, and rededicated on 14 April 2007.

"The 53rd FS 'Tigers' never fully recovered from the dark blemish on their otherwise exemplary record. The only way the USAF could make the issue and the pain go away was by closing the unit. This was done on March 10, 1999, leaving <a href="USAFE">USAFE</a> with only one Eagle squadron for the next war in its theater."

Liverpool F.C. in European football

<a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool Football Club</a>, an English professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club, is Britain's most successful team in <a href="UEFA">Union of European Football Associations</a> (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, they have won eleven European trophies: the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> (formerly known as the European Cup) five times, the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> (formerly known as the UEFA Cup) three times, and the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> three times.

Qualification for European competitions is determined by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a>, the occasion of the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>, following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons. Since being readmitted in 1991, they have qualified for the Champions League (the successor to the European Cup) nine times and the Europa League (the successor to the Uefa Cup) nine times.

As a result of their victory in the <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2005 UEFA Champions League Final</a>, Liverpool won the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Champion Clubs' Cup</a> trophy outright, and were awarded a <a href="UEFA%20badge%20of%20honour">multiple winner badge</a>. Liverpool's total of three UEFA Cup wins has been bettered only by <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, who have won the competition five times. They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on three occasions, a total only Milan and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (five titles each) have bettered.

<a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> is the club's most successful manager in Europe, with five trophies. Liverpool's biggest-margin win in Europe is an 11–0 victory over <a href="Str%C3%B8msgodset%20IF">Strømsgodset</a> in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. In European competitions, <a href="Jamie%20Carragher">Jamie Carragher</a> holds the club record for the most appearances, with 150, and <a href="Steven%20Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> is the club's record goalscorer, with 41 goals.

Club competitions between teams from different European countries can trace their origins as far back as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, who did not meet under normal circumstances. The <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Lipton%20Trophy">Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy</a>, named after entrepreneur and sportsman <a href="Thomas%20Lipton">Thomas Lipton</a>, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club <a href="FC%20Servette">FC Servette</a>. Founded in 1930, the <a href="Coupe%20des%20Nations">Coupe des Nations</a> featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.

The first continental competition organised by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> was the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> in 1955. Conceived by <a href="Gabriel%20Hanot">Gabriel Hanot</a>, the editor of "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>", as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition. When the European Cup was first played, Liverpool were in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, following relegation from the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> after the 1953–54 season, and thus were ineligible for the competition. During their time in the Second Division, two further competitions were created: the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>. Established in 1955, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was later re-branded as the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> when it came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971. Since the 2009–10 season, the competition has been known as the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions.

In 1962 Liverpool were promoted to the First Division. Two years later, they won the Football League championship, thus making their European debut in the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup">1964–65 European Cup</a>. In the following years, further European competitions were inaugurated. The first, the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, was originally a match played between the winners of the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup. First established in 1973, it changed formats in 2000; since then, it has been contested between the winners of the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup), following the Cup Winners' Cup amalgamation into the latter. The <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> was a competition for the winners of the European Cup (later, the UEFA Champions League) and the South American equivalent, the <a href="Copa%20Libertadores">Copa Libertadores</a>. Established in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup was jointly organised by UEFA and the <a href="CONMEBOL">Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol</a> (CONMEBOL). It ran until 2004, when the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>, which includes the winners of all <a href="FIFA%23Structure">six confederations</a>' regional championships replaced it.

<a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> began managing Liverpool in 1959, and it was under him that the team first competed in European competition in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup">1964–65</a>, qualifying for the European Cup by winning the First Division championship the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">previous season</a>. The club's first opponents were <a href="Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lag%20Reykjav%C3%ADkur">Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur</a> of Iceland, who they played in the preliminary round. Liverpool won 11–1 on <a href="aggregate%20score">aggregate</a>. The next round, against Belgian club <a href="RSC%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>, was the first time in Liverpool's history that they wore their now common all-red strip. The decision was made to change from red shirts, white shorts and socks by Shankly, who wanted his players to make more of a psychological impact on opponents. They beat Anderlecht and progressed to the semi-finals, where they met Italian team <a href="F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano">Internazionale</a>. Before the first <a href="Two-legged%20tie">leg</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>, Shankly asked two injured players to parade the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, which Liverpool had won the previous week, to intimidate the Italians. The team won the match 3–1, but Inter won the second leg 3–0, securing a 4–3 aggregate victory. The second leg was controversial; Shankly described it as "a war". He felt that the referee, Jose Maria Ortiz de Mendibel, had shown bias towards Internazionale, and the Liverpool players felt cheated by his decisions. The club's <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20FA%20Cup">1964–65 FA Cup</a> victory ensured qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup the following season, and in that competition, they reached their <a href="1966%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">first European final</a>. <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, Liverpool's opponents, employed counter-attacking tactics that had paid dividends in previous rounds and did so again, with the West Germans beating Liverpool 2–1 after <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>.
In the next four seasons, they competed in the European Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but failed to progress past the third round in either competition. A tie against Dutch team <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> during the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20European%20Cup">1966–67 European Cup</a> was to prove pivotal in the history of Liverpool in European competition. <a href="Ajax%205%E2%80%931%20Liverpool%20%281966%29">Ajax beat Liverpool 7–3 on aggregate</a>. However, the style of football that Ajax played – a patient passing game, inspired by <a href="Johann%20Cruyff">Johann Cruyff</a> – convinced Shankly that Liverpool had to replicate this style to be successful in Europe. Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, losing 1–0 on aggregate to <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. They competed in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, despite losing the <a href="1971%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1971 FA Cup Final</a>, as the FA Cup winners, <a href="Arsenal%20FC">Arsenal</a>, had also qualified for the European Cup by winning the league championship. Liverpool were eliminated in the second round by <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> of Germany, losing 3–1 on aggregate.

The changes made to Liverpool's tactics came to fruition during the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UEFA%20Cup">1972–73 UEFA Cup</a>. The club reached their <a href="1973%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">second European final</a>, where they faced <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> of Germany. Liverpool won the first leg 3–0 as a result of two goals from <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> and one from <a href="Larry%20Lloyd">Larry Lloyd</a>. Victory in this first leg meant Liverpool only needed to avoid losing by three or more goals in order to win the final. This influenced their tactics – "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported that Liverpool employed a "holding action" against the "attacking Germans". The tactics worked, allowing Mönchengladbach only two goals, granting Liverpool a 3–2 aggregate victory. Liverpool also won the First Division championship that season, and as a result qualified for the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20European%20Cup">1973–74 European Cup</a>, where they were eliminated in the second round by <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> of Yugoslavia. At the end of that season, Shankly retired.

Shankly was succeeded by his assistant, <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>, in 1974. Liverpool competed in the Cup Winners' Cup during Paisley's first season and defeated <a href="Str%C3%B8msgodset%20IF">Strømsgodset</a> of Norway 11–0 at Anfield. This remains the club's largest margin of victory in all matches. They lost in the next round to Hungarian side <a href="Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC">Ferencváros</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. In 1975–76 the club entered the UEFA Cup after a second-place finish in the First Division. Victories over <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> (Scotland), <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> (Spain), <a href="%C5%9Al%C4%85sk%20Wroc%C5%82aw">Śląsk Wrocław</a> (Poland), <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a> (East Germany) and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (Spain) took Liverpool to their third European final. Crucial to their progress was goalkeeper <a href="Ray%20Clemence">Ray Clemence</a>, who made two important <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> saves against Hibernian and Dresden, saving Liverpool from elimination on the away goals rule on both occasions. Their opponents in the final were <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a> of Belgium. Liverpool recovered from a two-goal deficit to win the first leg at Anfield 3–2, with <a href="Ray%20Kennedy">Ray Kennedy</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Case">Jimmy Case</a>, and Keegan scoring a goal each in a span of six minutes. A 1–1 draw at the <a href="Jan%20Breydel%20Stadion">Jan Breydel Stadion</a> in <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> meant Liverpool won 4–3 on aggregate, earning their second UEFA Cup.
As the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 league champions</a>, the club entered the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup">1976–77 European Cup</a>. They defeated <a href="Crusaders%20FC">Crusaders</a> of Northern Ireland and <a href="Trabzonspor">Trabzonspor</a> of Turkey to reach the quarter-finals, where they faced the runners-up from the previous season, <a href="AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne">Saint-Étienne</a>. The French team won the first leg 1–0. The second leg at Anfield began well for Liverpool when Keegan scored in the first two minutes. Saint-Étienne equalised to make the score 2–1 on aggregate in their favour. Kennedy scored for Liverpool, but the away goals rule meant they still needed another goal to win the tie. With six minutes remaining, <a href="David%20Fairclough">David Fairclough</a> was brought on to replace <a href="John%20Toshack">John Toshack</a>; he immediately scored in front of the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Kop</a>, ensuring a 3–2 aggregate victory for Liverpool. In the semi-finals, they defeated <a href="FC%20Z%C3%BCrich">FC Zürich</a> of Switzerland 6–1 on aggregate to reach the final, where they met their opponents from the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, Borussia Mönchengladbach. The <a href="1977%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a> was held in Rome, four days after the club had lost the <a href="1977%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1977 FA Cup Final</a> to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Before the match, Paisley announced that striker Toshack would be fit to start. However, he was not named in the matchday squad. This change upset the Germans' game plan and allowed Keegan to torment his marker, <a href="Berti%20Vogts">Berti Vogts</a>. Liverpool won 3–1 to become European champions for the first time.

By winning the European Cup, they qualified for the European Super Cup and played the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup, German team <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburg</a>, who had just signed Keegan. Liverpool won <a href="1977%20European%20Super%20Cup">the tie</a> 7–1 on aggregate. Liverpool entered the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20European%20Cup">1977–78 European Cup</a> as champions and received a <a href="Bye%20%28sports%29">bye</a> in the first round. They defeated Dynamo Dresden and Portuguese team <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> in the second round and quarter-finals, respectively. In the semi-final, the club again met Borussia Mönchengladbach, who won the first leg 2–1. Liverpool won the second leg 3–0, progressing to a second successive <a href="1978%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup final</a>, this time against Club Brugge at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in London. In the final <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>, who had been signed to replace Keegan, scored the winning goal after receiving the ball from a <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> pass. The 1–0 victory meant Liverpool became the first British team to retain the European Cup. They faced Anderlecht in the <a href="1978%20European%20Super%20Cup">1978 European Super Cup</a>, but failed to retain the trophy, losing 4–3 on aggregate against the Belgian side. Liverpool were eliminated in the first round of the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20European%20Cup">1978–79 European Cup</a> by English champions <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. Nottingham Forest won the tie 2–0 on aggregate, and went on to win the competition. Liverpool entered the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1979–80 European Cup</a> as English champions but were again eliminated in the first round, this time beaten 4–2 on aggregate by <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">Dinamo Tbilisi</a> of the Soviet Union.

Liverpool participated in the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20European%20Cup">1980–81 European Cup</a> as English league champions, defeating Finnish champions <a href="Oulun%20Palloseura">Oulun Palloseura</a>, Scottish club <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Sofia">CSKA Sofia</a> of Bulgaria to qualify for the semi-finals, where they faced three-time champions Bayern Munich. The first leg at Anfield finished goalless. In the second leg at the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a> in Munich, Ray Kennedy scored in the 83rd minute and, although the German side equalised, Liverpool went through to the final on the away goals rule. They faced Spanish side <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in the <a href="1981%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, held at the <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> in Paris. <a href="Alan%20Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a> scored the only goal to give Liverpool a 1–0 victory, which secured the club's—and Paisley's—third European Cup. As champions of Europe, Liverpool competed in the Intercontinental Cup against South American champions <a href="Clube%20de%20Regatas%20do%20Flamengo">Flamengo</a> of Brazil. Liverpool lost <a href="1981%20Intercontinental%20Cup">the match</a> 3–0. The club's defence of the European Cup in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">1981–82</a> was ended by CSKA Sofia in the quarter-finals. Another quarter-final exit occurred in the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20European%20Cup">1982–83 European Cup</a> when Polish club <a href="Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Widzew Łódź</a> eliminated Liverpool 4–3 on aggregate. Paisley retired as manager at the end of the season and was succeeded by his assistant, <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a>.

Liverpool entered the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20European%20Cup">1983–84 European Cup</a> as league champions for the fourth time in five seasons. Victories over <a href="Odense%20Boldklub">Odense</a> of Denmark and Spanish champions <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> brought Liverpool to face Portuguese champions Benfica in the quarter-finals. Liverpool won the first leg at Anfield 1–0. In the second leg, their tactic of withdrawing Dalglish into midfield put Benfica's game plan into disarray, leading to a 4–1 match victory and a 5–1 aggregate victory. Their opponents in the semi-finals were <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Dinamo București</a> of Romania. The tie proved a <a href="Liverpool%20vs.%20Dinamo%20Bucharest%2C%201984%20European%20Cup%20Semi-Final">brutal encounter</a>, characterised by Souness breaking the jaw of the Bucharest <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> <a href="Lic%C4%83%20Movil%C4%83">Lică Movilă</a>, and was won 3–1 on aggregate by Liverpool.

Fagan's first season in charge of Liverpool had been a successful one. When they reached their fourth European Cup final, they had already won the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> and the league championship; victory in the European final against Italian side <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a> would complete an unprecedented <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>. The final was played at Rome's <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico">Stadio Olimpico</a>, and Liverpool went ahead in the 13th minute when <a href="Phil%20Neal">Phil Neal</a> scored, though Roma equalised towards the end of the first half. The score remained the same throughout full and extra time; Liverpool won the subsequent <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>, with Alan Kennedy scoring the winning penalty after goalkeeper <a href="Bruce%20Grobbelaar">Bruce Grobbelaar</a> had put off <a href="Francesco%20Graziani">Francesco Graziani</a>, causing him to place his penalty over the crossbar. After the game, gangs of Roma fans assaulted Liverpool supporters travelling back to their hotels. Success in the European Cup entitled Liverpool to compete in the <a href="1984%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1984 Intercontinental Cup</a>. However, they were unable to beat the winners of the Copa Libertadores, <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente">Independiente</a> of Argentina, who claimed a 1–0 victory.

Liverpool entered the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20European%20Cup">1984–85 European Cup</a> as champions, and once again progressed to the final, where their opponents were <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> of Italy. They aimed to win their fifth European Cup and keep the trophy. The <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> was held at the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a> in Brussels. The choice of venue had been criticised due to the dilapidated state of the stadium, and the club tried to persuade UEFA to change the venue. Before the kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">caused a retaining wall to collapse</a>, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds more. Despite calls for an abandonment, the match was played, as it was felt that further trouble would be caused otherwise.

Juventus won the match 1–0; <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> scored from the <a href="penalty%20spot">penalty spot</a> to give Juventus their first European Cup. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool fans: the official UEFA observer stated, "Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt". Three days after the final, UEFA banned all English clubs from European competition for an indefinite period. Liverpool were initially given an additional three-year ban. Fagan retired after the 1984–85 season and was succeeded by Dalglish, who took over as <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a>.

The ban on English clubs in European competitions ultimately lasted for five years, and even when the ban was lifted in 1990, Liverpool were not re-admitted; they had to serve an extra year. The ban prevented them qualifying for the European Cup in 1986 (as league champions and FA Cup winners), the UEFA Cup in 1987 (as league runners-up), the European Cup in 1988 (as league champions), the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 (as FA Cup winners) and the European Cup in 1990 (as league champions).

Liverpool were allowed to return to European competition in the 1991–92 season, a year later than other English clubs. They qualified for the UEFA Cup as runners-up in the English league. Their manager by this stage was <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>, who had taken over towards the end of the previous season following Dalglish's resignation.

Their first match, in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, was against Finnish side <a href="FC%20Lahti">Kuusyi Lahti</a>, which they won 6–1. A 6–2 aggregate victory set up a tie against <a href="AJ%20Auxerre">Auxerre</a> of France in the second round who they beat 3–2 on aggregate. The club defeated <a href="FC%20Swarovski%20Tirol">Swarovski Tirol</a> of Austria in the third round 6–0 on aggregate before losing to <a href="Genoa%20C.F.C.">Genoa</a> (Italy) 4–1 over two legs in the quarter finals.

Liverpool's victory over <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in the <a href="1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1992 FA Cup Final</a> qualified them for the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, but this campaign was short-lived, as they were eliminated in the second round by Russian side <a href="FC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a>. Liverpool finished no higher than sixth in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> during the next two seasons, thus failing to qualify for European competition. In the <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20season%201995%E2%80%9396">1995–96 season</a>, they entered the UEFA Cup, but again progressed no further than the second round, this time losing to <a href="Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF">Brøndby</a> of Denmark.
As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the <a href="1996%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1996 FA Cup Final</a>, Liverpool were able to compete in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>. This proved the club's most successful campaign since their return to European competition, as they reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate by <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint–Germain</a>. In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an early stage of the competition, by <a href="RC%20Strasbourg%20Alsace">Strasbourg</a> and <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Premier%20League">1998–99 FA Premier League</a> meant the club did not qualify for Europe in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000</a>.

Having finished fourth in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League">1999–2000 FA Premier League</a>, Liverpool qualified for the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">2000–01 UEFA Cup</a>. Their victory in this competition marked a third win for a club. The entire season was the club's most successful since the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">1983–84 season</a>, as they won a cup treble consisting of the UEFA Cup, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Their opponents in the <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> in <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a> were <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Alavés</a> of Spain. The match was tied at 4–4 in extra time when Alavés defender <a href="Delf%C3%AD%20Geli">Delfí Geli</a> scored an own goal to give Liverpool victory on the <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> rule. 
The performance of <a href="Gary%20McAllister">Gary McAllister</a>, whose free-kick resulted in the winning goal, was praised as "outstanding" by <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Trevor Brooking</a>. This was the club's first European trophy since their European Cup victory in 1984. As UEFA Cup winners, Liverpool played in the <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2001 UEFA Super Cup</a> against Champions League winners Bayern Munich and won 3–2.

In the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a>, Liverpool returned to the European Cup, now called the UEFA Champions League, for the first time since the Heysel disaster. A 2–0 victory over Roma in the second group stage meant they progressed to the quarter-finals. They faced German club <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> and won the first leg 1–0. The outlook for the second leg appeared to be to Liverpool's advantage, as their counter-attacking style of play had served them well during away matches throughout the season; however, they lost the second leg 4–2 and were eliminated 4–3 on aggregate.

A second-place finish in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02 FA Premier League</a> entitled Liverpool to participate in the Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition. The third-place finish meant they entered the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup">2002–03 UEFA Cup</a>. Liverpool beat Dutch team <a href="Vitesse%20Arnhem">Vitesse Arnhem</a> and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>. A 1–1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals if they did not concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3–1 on aggregate.

Liverpool entered the UEFA Cup for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a>, after <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> beat them on the final day of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">previous league season</a> to claim the fourth place needed to qualify for the Champions League. Liverpool were eliminated in the fourth round by eventual runners-up <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> of France. At the end of the season, manager <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> was replaced by <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>.

Liverpool had finished fourth in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">2003–04 season</a>, which qualified them to compete in the Champions League in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>. A poor start in the group stages, with two losses in their first five games, had the club facing elimination. A 3–1 victory over Greek side <a href="Olympiacos%20F.C.">Olympiacos</a>, however, eventually ensured their passage to the knock-out rounds. Liverpool beat Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus to reach the semi-finals, and progressed to the final after they beat Chelsea 1–0 on aggregate; the goal scored by <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201978%29">Luis García</a> was referred to as a "<a href="ghost%20goal">ghost goal</a>" by Chelsea manager <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>, as it was unclear whether the ball crossed the goal line. Liverpool's performances in Europe contrasted strongly with their league form, where they struggled to finish in the top-four and thus ensure qualification for the next Champions League season.

Liverpool faced six-time European champions Milan in the <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> at the <a href="Atat%C3%BCrk%20Olympic%20Stadium">Atatürk Stadium</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> on 25 May 2005. Trailing 3–0 at half-time, they scored three goals in a six-minute spell in the second half to level the score at 3–3. There were no goals during extra time, so the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. With the shoot-out score at 3–2, Liverpool goalkeeper <a href="Jerzy%20Dudek">Jerzy Dudek</a> saved <a href="Andriy%20Shevchenko">Andriy Shevchenko</a>'s penalty to give Liverpool victory. The nature of Liverpool's comeback victory has led to the match being referred to as the "miracle of Istanbul." As this was the club's fifth European Cup victory, Liverpool were allowed to keep the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Champion Clubs' Cup</a> permanently, and a new trophy was commissioned for the following year's competition. The victory also entitled Liverpool to compete in the <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2005 UEFA Super Cup</a> at <a href="Stade%20Louis%20II">Stade Louis II</a>, Monaco in August. They defeated UEFA Cup winners <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CSKA Moscow</a> of Russia 3–1(aet.) to win their third Super Cup. Their success in the Champions League meant Liverpool also qualified for the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Championship">2005 FIFA Club World Championship</a>, where they lost 1–0 in the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Championship%20Final">final</a> to Brazilian team <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC">São Paulo</a>.

A fifth-place finish in the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect of not being able to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%202005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualification">required to start</a> in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.

In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2006–07 Champions League</a>, Liverpool progressed from the group stages and beat holders Barcelona, <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> and Chelsea to face Milan in a rematch of the 2005 final. The Liverpool team, which contained only five players from the 2005 final, enjoyed more possession than in 2005, but two goals from <a href="Filippo%20Inzaghi">Filippo Inzaghi</a> gave Milan their seventh European Cup in <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">a 2–1 win</a>.
Liverpool were eliminated from the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08 Champions League</a> in the semi-finals by Chelsea, who they had beaten in the semi-finals in 2005 and 2007. A fourth-place finish in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Premier%20League">2007–08 Premier League</a> secured their entry into the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2008–09 Champions League</a>. Liverpool reached the quarter-finals and again faced Chelsea, but lost 7–5 on aggregate.

A second-place finish in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">2008–09 Premier League</a> entitled Liverpool to compete in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2009–10 UEFA Champions League</a>, but their campaign was short-lived; they finished third in their group, and were eliminated from the competition. They entered the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2009–10 UEFA Europa League</a>, progressing to the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by eventual winners <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> of Spain on the away goals rule after the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate.

Rafael Benítez left the club at the end of the 2009–10 season and was replaced by <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>. A seventh-place finish in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">2009–10 Premier League</a> meant Liverpool would be competing in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2010–11 Europa League</a>. They beat <a href="FK%20Rabotni%C4%8Dki">Rabotnički</a> of Macedonia and <a href="Trabzonspor">Trabzonspor</a> of Turkey to progress to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a>, where Liverpool were drawn alongside <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a>, <a href="FC%20Utrecht">FC Utrecht</a> and <a href="FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Steaua București</a>. They won two games and drew four to finish top of their group with ten points and progress to the round of 32. They were drawn against <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> in the next round. Before the tie was played, however, Hodgson was replaced by former manager Kenny Dalglish, who initially served as a <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>. A 1–0 aggregate victory ensured progression to the round of 16, in which Liverpool lost 1–0 on aggregate to eventual runners-up <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Braga</a>. A sixth-place finish in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20League">2010–11 Premier League</a> meant the club failed to qualify for European competition for the first time since 1999. On the following season, victory in the <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> ensured Liverpool a place in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2012–13 Europa League</a>.

Liverpool qualified for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase">knockout phase</a> of the 2012–13 Europa League after winning their group at the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a>, but were eliminated from the competition at the round of 32 by <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> on the away goals rule after a 0–2 loss away and a 3–1 win at home. A seventh-place finish in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13 Premier League</a> and a failure to secure qualification via domestic cups meant Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition in the 2013–14 season. A second-placed finish in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2013–14 Premier League</a>, ensured Liverpool qualified for the group stage of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2014–15 Champions League</a>. One win out of six in the group stage meant they were eliminated and entered into the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase">knockout phase</a> of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014–15 Europa League</a>. The campaign was short-lived, as Liverpool eliminated by <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.">Beşiktaş</a> in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Round%20of%2032">round of 32</a>.

Finishing sixth in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Premier%20League">2014–15 Premier League</a> qualified Liverpool directly to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a> of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 Europa League</a>, where they faced <a href="FC%20Sion">Sion</a>, <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and for the first time, Russian side <a href="FC%20Rubin%20Kazan">Rubin Kazan</a>. During the group stage, manager <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> was replaced by <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>. After winning the group, Liverpool qualified for the knockout phase, beating <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a> in the round of 32 before facing <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">bitter rivals</a> Manchester United in the round of 16, the two clubs' first meeting in Europe. Liverpool defeated them 3–1 on aggregate and victory led to a quarter-final tie with Klopp's former team <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. After a 1–1 draw in the first leg at <a href="Westfalenstadion">Signal Iduna Park</a>, Dortmund went 3–1 up in the return leg at Anfield with 33 minutes remaining, requiring Liverpool to score three goals due to the <a href="Away%20goals%20rule">Away goals rule</a>. Goals from <a href="Philippe%20Coutinho">Philippe Coutinho</a>, <a href="Mamadou%20Sakho">Mamadou Sakho</a> and a last minute winner from <a href="Dejan%20Lovren">Dejan Lovren</a>, however, saw Liverpool complete the comeback and qualify for their first European semi-final since 2010. There they faced <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>, completing a second comeback after overturning a 1–0 defeat in the first leg at <a href="Estadio%20El%20Madrigal">El Madrigal</a> to qualify for the final with a 3–1 aggregate win. Liverpool played <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in the <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a> at <a href="St.%20Jakob-Park">St. Jakob-Park</a>, <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, on 18 May, losing 3–1. A 4th-place finish in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">2016–17 Premier League</a> qualified Liverpool for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a> and a return to Europe's premier club tournament for only the second time in 8 years during the 2010s.
On 17 October 2017, Liverpool won 7-0 away to <a href="NK%20Maribor">Maribor</a> in the third round of matches of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a> of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League. The win was a record away win for Liverpool in European competitions and also the biggest away win by an English team in the history of the European Cup. After qualifying top of their group, they proceeded to defeat Porto 5-0 at the Estadio de Dragao, before holding them to a 0-0 draw on the return leg, then defeated domestic rivals Manchester City 3-0 and 2-1, and in the semi-finals, defeated Roma 5-2 at Anfield, before a 4-2 loss led to a 7-6 aggregate win, taking them to the <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>, against holders Real Madrid. Liverpool lost the final by 3-1 but finished 4th in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2017–18 Premier League</a> to qualify for the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2018–19 UEFA Champions League</a>.

1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· is the <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29">infinite series</a> whose terms are the successive <a href="positive%20integer">positive integer</a>s, given <a href="alternating%20series">alternating signs</a>. Using <a href="summation">sigma summation notation</a> the sum of the first "m" terms of the series can be expressed as

The infinite series <a href="divergent%20series">diverges</a>, meaning that its sequence of <a href="partial%20sum">partial sum</a>s, , does not tend towards any finite <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit</a>. Nonetheless, in the mid-18th century, <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> wrote what he admitted to be a <a href="List%20of%20paradoxes%23Mathematics">paradoxical equation</a>:

A <a href="Rigour%23Mathematical%20rigour">rigorous</a> explanation of this equation would not arrive until much later. Starting in 1890, <a href="Ernesto%20Ces%C3%A0ro">Ernesto Cesàro</a>, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Borel">Émile Borel</a> and others investigated <a href="well-defined">well-defined</a> methods to assign generalized sums to divergent series—including new interpretations of Euler's attempts. Many of these summability methods easily assign to a "value" of . <a href="Ces%C3%A0ro%20summation">Cesàro summation</a> is one of the few methods that do not sum , so the series is an example where a slightly stronger method, such as <a href="Divergent%20series%23Abelian%20means">Abel summation</a>, is required.

The series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is closely related to <a href="Grandi%27s%20series">Grandi's series</a> . Euler treated these two as special cases of for arbitrary "n", a line of research extending his work on the <a href="Basel%20problem">Basel problem</a> and leading towards the <a href="functional%20equation">functional equation</a>s of what are now known as the <a href="Dirichlet%20eta%20function">Dirichlet eta function</a> and the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>.

The series' terms (1, −2, 3, −4, ...) do not approach <a href="0%20%28number%29">0</a>; therefore diverges by the <a href="term%20test">term test</a>. For later reference, it will also be useful to see the divergence on a fundamental level. By definition, the convergence or divergence of an infinite series is determined by the <a href="limit%20of%20a%20sequence">convergence or divergence</a> of its sequence of partial sums, and the partial sums of are:
This sequence is notable for including every integer exactly once—even 0 if one counts the <a href="empty%20sum">empty partial sum</a>—and thereby establishing the <a href="countable%20set">countability</a> of the set formula_3 of <a href="integer">integer</a>s. The sequence of partial sums clearly shows that the series does not converge to a particular number (for any proposed limit "x", we can find a point beyond which the subsequent partial sums are all outside the interval ["x"−1, "x"+1]), so diverges.

Since the terms 1, −2, 3, −4, 5, −6, ... follow a simple pattern, the series can be manipulated by shifting and term-by-term addition to yield a numerical value. If it can make sense to write for some ordinary number "s", the following manipulations argue for 

Although 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... does not have a sum in the usual sense, the equation can be supported as the most natural answer if such a sum is to be defined. A <a href="generalization">generalized</a> definition of the "sum" of a divergent series is called a <a href="summation%20method">summation method</a> or <a href="summability%20method">summability method</a>. There are many different methods (some of which are described <a href="%23Specific%20methods">below</a>) and it is desirable that they share <a href="Divergent%20series%23Properties%20of%20summation%20methods">certain properties</a> with ordinary summation. What the above manipulations actually prove is the following: Given any summability method that is <a href="Divergent%20series%23Properties%20of%20summation%20methods">linear and stable</a> and sums the series , the sum it produces is . Furthermore, since

such a method must also sum <a href="Grandi%27s%20series">Grandi's series</a> as 

In 1891, <a href="Ernesto%20Ces%C3%A0ro">Ernesto Cesàro</a> expressed hope that divergent series would be rigorously brought into <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, pointing out, "One already writes and asserts that both the sides are equal to ." For Cesàro, this equation was an application of a theorem he had published the previous year, which is the first theorem in the history of summable divergent series. The details on his summation method are <a href="%23Ces%C3%A0ro%20and%20H%C3%B6lder">below</a>; the central idea is that is the <a href="Cauchy%20product">Cauchy product</a> (discrete <a href="convolution">convolution</a>) of with .

The Cauchy product of two infinite series is defined even when both of them are divergent. In the case where "a" = "b" = (−1), the terms of the Cauchy product are given by the finite diagonal sums

The product series is then

Thus a summation method that respects the Cauchy product of two series — and assigns to the series the sum 1/2 — will also assign to the series the sum 1/4. With the result of the previous section, this implies an equivalence between summability of and with methods that are linear, stable, and respect the Cauchy product.

Cesàro's theorem is a subtle example. The series is Cesàro-summable in the weakest sense, called while requires a stronger form of Cesàro's theorem, being Since all forms of Cesàro's theorem are linear and stable, the values of the sums are as we have calculated.

To find the (C, 1) <a href="Ces%C3%A0ro%20summation">Cesàro sum</a> of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ..., if it exists, one needs to compute the <a href="arithmetic%20mean">arithmetic mean</a>s of the partial sums of the series.
The partial sums are:

and the arithmetic means of these partial sums are:

This sequence of means does not converge, so 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is not Cesàro summable.

There are two well-known generalizations of Cesàro summation: the conceptually simpler of these is the sequence of (H, "n") methods for <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s "n". The (H, 1) sum is Cesàro summation, and higher methods repeat the computation of means. Above, the even means converge to , while the odd means are all equal to 0, so the means "of the means" converge to the average of 0 and , namely . So is (H, 2) summable to .

The "H" stands for <a href="Otto%20H%C3%B6lder">Otto Hölder</a>, who first proved in 1882 what mathematicians now think of as the connection between <a href="Divergent%20series%23Abelian%20means">Abel summation</a> and (H, "n") summation; was his first example. The fact that is the (H, 2) sum of guarantees that it is the Abel sum as well; this will also be proved directly below.

The other commonly formulated generalization of Cesàro summation is the sequence of (C, "n") methods. It has been proven that (C, "n") summation and (H, "n") summation always give the same results, but they have different historical backgrounds. In 1887, Cesàro came close to stating the definition of (C, "n") summation, but he gave only a few examples. In particular, he summed to by a method that may be rephrased as (C, "n") but was not justified as such at the time. He formally defined the (C, n) methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the Cauchy product of a (C, "n")-summable series and a (C, "m")-summable series is (C, "m" + "n" + 1)-summable.

In a 1749 report, <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> admits that the series diverges but prepares to sum it anyway:

Euler proposed a generalization of the word "sum" several times. In the case of , his ideas are similar to what is now known as <a href="Divergent%20series%23Abelian%20means">Abel summation</a>:

There are many ways to see that, at least for <a href="absolute%20value">absolute value</a>s , Euler is right in that
One can take the <a href="Taylor%20series">Taylor expansion</a> of the right-hand side, or apply the formal <a href="polynomial%20long%20division">long division process for polynomials</a>. Starting from the left-hand side, one can follow the general heuristics above and try multiplying by twice or <a href="square%20%28algebra%29">squaring</a> the <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a> . Euler also seems to suggest <a href="derivative">differentiating</a> the latter series term by term.

In the modern view, the series 1 − 2"x" + 3"x" − 4"x" + ... does not define a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> at , so that value cannot simply be substituted into the resulting expression. Since the function is defined for all , one can still take the limit as "x" approaches 1, and this is the definition of the Abel sum:

Euler applied another technique to the series: the <a href="Binomial%20transform%23Euler%20transform">Euler transform</a>, one of his own inventions. To compute the Euler transform, one begins with the sequence of positive terms that makes up the alternating series—in this case The first element of this sequence is labeled "a".

Next one needs the sequence of <a href="difference%20operator">forward differences</a> among ; this is just The first element of "this" sequence is labeled Δ"a". The Euler transform also depends on differences of differences, and higher <a href="iterated%20function">iterations</a>, but all the forward differences among are 0. The Euler transform of is then defined as

In modern terminology, one says that is <a href="Euler%20summation">Euler summable</a> to .

The Euler summability implies another kind of summability as well. Representing as

one has the related everywhere-convergent series

The <a href="Borel%20summation">Borel sum</a> of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is therefore

Saichev and Woyczyński arrive at by applying only two physical principles: "infinitesimal relaxation" and "separation of scales". To be precise, these principles lead them to define a broad family of "-summation methods", all of which sum the series to :


This result generalizes Abel summation, which is recovered by letting ("x") = exp(−"x"). The general statement can be proved by pairing up the terms in the series over "m" and converting the expression into a <a href="Riemann%20integral">Riemann integral</a>. For the latter step, the <a href="Summation%20of%20Grandi%27s%20series%23Separation%20of%20scales">corresponding proof</a> for applies the <a href="mean%20value%20theorem">mean value theorem</a>, but here one needs the stronger Lagrange form of <a href="Taylor%27s%20theorem">Taylor's theorem</a>.

The threefold Cauchy product of is the alternating series of <a href="triangular%20number">triangular number</a>s; its Abel and Euler sum is . The fourfold Cauchy product of is the alternating series of <a href="tetrahedral%20number">tetrahedral number</a>s, whose Abel sum is .

Another generalization of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... in a slightly different direction is the series for other values of "n". For positive integers "n", these series have the following Abel sums:
where "B" are the <a href="Bernoulli%20number">Bernoulli number</a>s. For even "n", this reduces to

This last sum became an object of particular ridicule by <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a> in 1826:

Cesàro's teacher, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Charles%20Catalan">Eugène Charles Catalan</a>, also disparaged divergent series. Under Catalan's influence, Cesàro initially referred to the "conventional formulas" for as "absurd equalities", and in 1883 Cesàro expressed a typical view of the time that the formulas were false but still somehow formally useful. Finally, in his 1890 "Sur la multiplication des séries", Cesàro took a modern approach starting from definitions.

The series are also studied for non-integer values of "n"; these make up the <a href="Dirichlet%20eta%20function">Dirichlet eta function</a>. Part of Euler's motivation for studying series related to was the <a href="functional%20equation">functional equation</a> of the eta function, which leads directly to the functional equation of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>. Euler had already become famous for finding the values of these functions at positive <a href="even%20and%20odd%20numbers">even integers</a> (including the <a href="Basel%20problem">Basel problem</a>), and he was attempting to find the values at the positive <a href="even%20and%20odd%20numbers">odd integers</a> (including <a href="Ap%C3%A9ry%27s%20constant">Apéry's constant</a>) as well, a problem that remains elusive today. The eta function in particular is easier to deal with by Euler's methods because its <a href="Dirichlet%20series">Dirichlet series</a> is Abel summable everywhere; the zeta function's Dirichlet series is much harder to sum where it diverges. For example, the counterpart of in the zeta function is the non-alternating series , which has deep applications in modern <a href="physics">physics</a> but requires much stronger methods to sum.

Kenneth Walker

<a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> Kenneth Newton Walker (17 July 1898 – 5 January 1943) was a <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> aviator and a <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> general who exerted a significant influence on the development of airpower doctrine. He posthumously received the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> in World War II.

Walker joined the United States Army in 1917, after the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">American entry into World War I</a>. He trained as an aviator and became a flying instructor. In 1920, after the end of the war, he received a commission in the <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Regular Army</a>. After service in various capacities, Walker graduated from the <a href="Air%20Corps%20Tactical%20School">Air Corps Tactical School</a> in 1929, and then served as an instructor there. He supported the creation of a separate air organization that is not subordinate to other military branches. He was a forceful advocate of the efficacy of <a href="strategic%20bombardment">strategic bombardment</a>, publishing articles on the subject and becoming part of a clique known as the "<a href="Bomber%20Mafia">Bomber Mafia</a>" that argued for the primacy of bombardment over other forms of military aviation. He advanced the notion that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack. He participated in the Air Corps Tactical School's development of the doctrine of <a href="industrial%20web%20theory">industrial web theory</a>, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. Shortly before the United States entered World War II, Walker became one of four officers assigned to the <a href="Air%20War%20Plans%20Division">Air War Plans Division</a>, which was tasked with developing a production requirements plan for the war in the air. Together, these officers devised the AWPD-1 plan, a blueprint for the imminent air war against Germany that called for the creation of an enormous air force to win the war through strategic bombardment.

In 1942, Walker was promoted to brigadier general and transferred to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Southwest Pacific</a>, where he became Commanding General, <a href="V%20Bomber%20Command">V Bomber Command</a>, <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>. The Southwest Pacific contained few strategic targets, relegating the bombers to the role of interdicting supply lines and supporting the ground forces. This resulted in a doctrinal clash between Walker and <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20C.%20Kenney">George C. Kenney</a>, an attack aviator, over the proper method of employing bombers. Walker frequently flew combat missions over <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, for which he received the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>. On 5 January 1943, he was shot down and killed leading a daylight bombing raid over <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

Walker was born in <a href="Los%20Cerrillos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Cerrillos, New Mexico</a>, on 17 July 1898 to Wallace Walker and his wife Emma "née" Overturf. The family subsequently moved to <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>. Kenneth's father left when he was young, and Emma became a single mother. Kenneth began his education at the Maria Mitchell School in Denver, Colorado, from 1905 to 1908, and then attended the Columbian School there from 1908 to 1912. He went to <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri%29">Central High School</a> for a time until 1913 when he started at the Omaha High School of Commerce, from which he graduated in 1915. From January to June 1917 he took a course at the YMCA Night School in Denver. He then studied business administration at <a href="La%20Salle%20Extension%20University">La Salle Extension University</a>.

Walker enlisted in the United States Army in Denver, on 15 December 1917. He received flight training at the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>'s School of Military Aeronautics and at the pilot training base at <a href="Mather%20Air%20Force%20Base">Mather Field</a>, near Sacramento, California. He was awarded his <a href="Aircrew%20Badge">Aircrew Badge</a> and commissioned as a temporary <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Service">United States Army Air Service</a> on 2 November 1918. He then attended the Flying Instructor's School at <a href="Brooks%20City-Base">Brooks Field</a> in San Antonio, Texas, and became an instructor at the flight training center at <a href="Barron%20Field">Barron Field</a>. In March 1919, he was posted to <a href="Fort%20Sill">Fort Sill</a> as an instructor at the Air Service Flying School. During 1918, the School for Aerial Observers and the Air Service Flying School were built at nearby <a href="Post%20Field">Post Field</a>, where Walker spent the next four years as a pilot, instructor, supply officer, and post adjutant.

Walker became one of many officers holding wartime commissions to receive a commission in the <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Regular Army</a>, into which he was commissioned as a <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> on 1 July 1920, but was subsequently reduced in rank to second lieutenant on 15 December 1922, another common occurrence in the aftermath of World War I when the wartime army was demobilized. Already a command pilot, he also qualified as a combat observer in 1922. He was promoted to first lieutenant again on 24 July 1924.

Walker courted Marguerite Potter, a sorority member and sociology graduate at the Norman campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a>. The two were married in September 1922. In lieu of a honeymoon, they boarded a troop transport to the Philippines on 12 December 1922. Walker initially became Commander of the Air Intelligence Section at <a href="Nichols%20Field">Camp Nichols</a>. He was then posted to the Philippine Air Depot, where he served at various times as property officer, supply officer, adjutant, and depot inspector, before ultimately being assigned to the <a href="28th%20Bomb%20Squadron">28th Bombardment Squadron</a> in 1924. In August 1923 he crashed an <a href="Airco%20DH.4">Airco DH.4</a> on take off but walked away unhurt. The Walkers had two sons, Kenneth Jr., born in February 1927, and Douglas, born in January 1933.
Walker returned to the United States in February 1925 and was posted to <a href="Langley%20Air%20Force%20Base">Langley Field</a>, where he became a member of the Air Service Board. He served successively as adjutant of the 59th Service Squadron, commander of the <a href="11th%20Bomb%20Squadron">11th Bombardment Squadron</a>, and operations officer of the <a href="2d%20Bomb%20Wing">2nd Bomb Group</a> there. In June 1929 he graduated from the <a href="Air%20Corps%20Tactical%20School">Air Corps Tactical School</a>, where he studied under Captain <a href="Robert%20Olds">Robert Olds</a>, a former aide to air power pioneer <a href="Billy%20Mitchell%20%28general%29">Billy Mitchell</a> and a passionate advocate of strategic bombing. He then served at the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor under Captain Olds in the Bombardment Section until July 1933, both at Langley and at <a href="Maxwell%20Air%20Force%20Base">Maxwell Field</a>, where the school was relocated in 1931. Walker became part of a small clique of Air Corps Tactical School instructors that became known as the "<a href="Bomber%20Mafia">Bomber Mafia</a>", that argued that bombardment was the most important form of airpower. Its members also included <a href="Haywood%20Hansell">Haywood Hansell</a>, <a href="Donald%20Wilson%20%28general%29">Donald Wilson</a>, <a href="Harold%20L.%20George">Harold L. George</a>, and <a href="Robert%20M.%20Webster">Robert M. Webster</a>, Their influence was such that, during their tenure, bombardment achieved primacy over pursuit in the development of Air Corps doctrine.

One of Walker's tasks was to rewrite the bombardment text. He felt it was flawed because it failed to drive home what he saw as the most important fact, that "bombardment aviation is the basic arm of the air force". Following the views of air power theorists Billy Mitchell, <a href="Hugh%20Trenchard%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Trenchard">Hugh Trenchard</a>, and <a href="Giulio%20Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a>, Walker enunciated two fundamental principles: that bombardment would take the form of daylight precision bombing; and that it should be directed against critical industrial targets. In his article "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", published in the "Coast Artillery Journal" in October 1930, he argued that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack and that "the most efficacious method of stopping a bombardment attack would appear to be an offensive against the bombardment airdrome." The Bomber Mafia argued that bombers flew too high and too fast to be intercepted by fighters, that even if they were intercepted, the bombers had enough firepower to drive off their attackers, and enough armor and resilience to absorb any damage their attackers might attempt to inflict. The Air Corps Tactical School developed a doctrine that became known as <a href="industrial%20web%20theory">industrial web theory</a>, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. Walker drove home his belief in bombardment with a famous dictum from his lectures: "A well-organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that can not be stopped."

Walker published another professional article in 1933, entitled "Bombardment Aviation: Bulwark of National Defense". "Whenever we speak in terms of 'air force' we are thinking of bombardment aviation," he wrote, dismissing other forms of aviation. This was orthodox at the Air Corps Tactical School, which taught that "every dollar which goes into the building of auxiliary aviation and special types, which types are not essential for the efficient functioning of the striking force can only occur at the expense of that air force's offensive power." Walker's major thesis was that "a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop when directed against land objectives." At the conclusion of his article, he renewed his call for the creation of an independent air force "as a force with a distinct mission, of importance co-equal to that of the Army and the Navy." Walker's persistent advocacy of strategic bombing led to frequent clashes with Captain <a href="Claire%20Chennault">Claire Chennault</a>, who led instruction in pursuit aviation at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1931 to 1936. Chennault believed that the right mix of fighters and ground defenses could successfully defeat a bomber assault and ridiculed Walker for suggesting that bombers could not be stopped, leading to "legendary" debates between the two.

In November 1934, Walker, now a student at the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20School">Command and General Staff School</a> at Fort Leavenworth, testified with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on the military aspects of aviation before the <a href="Clark%20Howell">Howell</a> Commission on Federal Aviation. All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have brought us to our knees." They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries ... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".

The appearance in 1935 of the <a href="Boeing%20B-17">Boeing B-17</a> bomber gave the bombardment advocates the weapon they had long dreamt of. Not only could it carry an impressive bomb load of of bombs for or for , but its top speed of was faster than that of the contemporary <a href="P-26%20Peashooter">P-26</a> fighter. Its high speed also led the bombardment advocates to downplay the danger posed by antiaircraft fire.

Walker's marriage ended in divorce in 1934, after he had an affair. He remarried and had a son named John, but his second marriage also ended in divorce. Walker graduated from the Command and General Staff School in June 1935 and was posted to <a href="Hamilton%20Air%20Force%20Base">Hamilton Field</a>, first as Intelligence and Operations Officer of the <a href="7th%20Bomb%20Wing">7th Bombardment Group</a>, and then as commander of the <a href="9th%20Bomb%20Squadron">9th Bombardment Squadron</a>. While landing a <a href="Martin%20B-12">Martin B-12</a> bomber, he overshot the runway. The station commander, Brigadier General <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry Arnold</a> reported that Walker, "supposed to be one of our best pilots, apparently cuts out completely, uses up and finally hits a concrete block and spoils a perfectly good airplane when he normally would have given her the gun and gone around again." After fifteen years in the rank, jokes circulated about his being the most senior first lieutenant in the Air Corps, but he was finally promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a> on 1 August 1935. He was temporary <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> from 20 October 1935 to 16 June 1936, and again on 4 October 1938, before the rank finally became substantive on 1 July 1940. He had another accident in 1937, when he crashed a B-17 on take off from <a href="Denver%20Municipal%20Airport">Denver Municipal Airport</a> but this time his flying skills were credited with saving the entire crew of nine from injury.

In 1938 Walker began a three-year tour in Hawaii, where he was operations officer of the <a href="5th%20Bomb%20Wing">5th Bombardment Group</a> at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Luke Field</a>, executive officer at <a href="Hickam%20Air%20Force%20Base">Hickam Field</a>, and then commander of the <a href="18th%20Wing">18th Pursuit Group</a> at <a href="Wheeler%20Army%20Airfield">Wheeler Field</a>. Commanding a pursuit group involved a considerable change of pace for a man whose career thus far had been spent in bombers. His adjutant, First Lieutenant <a href="Bruce%20K.%20Holloway">Bruce K. Holloway</a> felt that Walker never demonstrated the "emotional exhilaration toward flying a high performance machine that is so typical of fighter pilots." Nor did he warm to the <a href="Curtiss%20P-36%20Hawk">Curtiss P-36 Hawk</a> fighter, especially after a near-fatal accident.

Walker returned to the United States in January 1941 and joined the <a href="Air%20War%20Plans%20Division">Air War Plans Division</a> in the Office of the Chief of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> in Washington, D.C., as an assistant chief of staff. Brigadier General <a href="Carl%20Andrew%20Spaatz">Carl Andrew Spaatz</a> was head of the division. Lieutenant Colonels Olds and <a href="Muir%20S.%20Fairchild">Muir S. Fairchild</a>, old colleagues of Walker's from the Air Corps Tactical School, were two of Spaatz' assistants. Walker was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 15 July 1941. In the June 1941 reorganization of the Air Corps, Spaatz became chief of staff to the Commanding General, <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>, <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> Henry H. Arnold, who appointed Colonel <a href="Harold%20L.%20George">Harold L. George</a>, a former student of Walker at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1931 to 1932, to replace Spaatz as head of the Air War Plans Division. Walker joined George's planning team, along with Majors <a href="Haywood%20S.%20Hansell">Haywood S. Hansell</a> and <a href="Laurence%20S.%20Kuter">Laurence S. Kuter</a>. All were former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School and members of the "Bomber Mafia".
The Air War Plans Division was tasked with developing a production requirements plan for President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who wanted it by 10 September 1941. In just nine days in August 1941, George, Olds, Fairchild, Walker, Kuter and Hansell drafted the AWPD-1 plan for a war against Germany. Reflecting their belief in bombardment as the principal form of aviation, the plan was based upon the number of bombers that they estimated would be required to knock out Germany's key industries – electric power, transportation and petroleum. In order to neutralize anticipated opposition from the German Air Force, they planned for bombing aircraft factories and the sources of the light metals needed for aircraft production. These targets were collated along with the estimated tonnage of bombs required to destroy them.

The plan called for a bomber force of 98 medium, heavy and very heavy bomber groups, totaling 6,834 aircraft. Sixteen fighter groups would defend the bombers' bases. Should this bomber force prove insufficient to defeat Germany without a major land offensive, provision was made for a tactical air force of 13 light bomber groups, two photo reconnaissance groups, five fighter groups, 108 observation squadrons and 19 transport groups. In retrospect, this part of the plan represented a considerable underestimate. The plan required 2,164,916 personnel, including 103,482 pilots. At the moment though, the United States had, as General Arnold put it, "plans but not planes". Due to poor security, verbatim extracts of AWPD-1 were published in the "Chicago Tribune" and other newspapers on 4 December.

The war in Europe had cast grave doubt on the Air Corps' <a href="Military%20doctrine">doctrine</a> that fighters could not shoot down bombers and <a href="the%20bomber%20will%20always%20get%20through">the bomber will always get through</a>. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> had demonstrated that it could shoot down bombers, while its own bomber force had suffered such heavy losses over Germany that it had abandoned daylight bombing in favor of night raids. Nonetheless, the planners held firm in their belief that, since American bombers were better armed and armored than their British or German counterparts, the bombers would get through, even in daylight, and that enemy fighter strength could be destroyed on the ground by bombing airbases and factories. "Each of us," Kuter wrote years later, "scoffed at the idea that fighters would be needed to protect bombers, to enable bombers to reach their objective. In preparing AWPD-l, we stayed in that rut." Walker was promoted to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> on 1 February 1942.

In April 1942 Walker joined the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department General Staff as executive officer of Brigadier General <a href="St.%20Clair%20Streett">St. Clair Streett</a>'s Theater Group. He co-authored a memorandum with Brigadier General <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> in which they advanced the position that the determinations of the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> "must be taken as authoritative unless and until modified by the same or higher authority." After his death, Walker was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> in recognition of his contributions as a staff officer at OPD.

Walker was promoted to brigadier general on 17 June 1942 and was transferred to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a>, flying to Australia in the company of Brigadier General <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a>, another newly promoted brigadier general. The commander of Allied Air Forces there, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20Brett%20%28military%29">George Brett</a>, aware that he would soon be replaced, sent the two newcomers on an inspection trip. Walker learned a great deal. He joined three combat missions over New Guinea, experiencing for himself the difficulties that his aircrews faced. He also experienced an air raid in <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>. For this, Walker was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>. His citation read: 
Brett's replacement, Major General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, arrived in the theater in August, and Walker was appointed Commanding General, <a href="V%20Bomber%20Command">V Bomber Command</a>, <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> on 3 September, with his headquarters in <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>. At this time, Port Moresby was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through Port Moresby to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, at the height of the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>, Kenney sent Walker to Port Moresby for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small gestures of fellowship, such as standing in line with the men at meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a>. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, all four of them eventually disobeyed their orders.

The Southwest Pacific was not a promising theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day did not have the range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries. Thus, "The air mission was to interdict Japan's sea supply lanes and enable the ground forces to conduct an island-hopping strategy." This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.
Walker objected to Kenney's suggestion that the bombers conduct attacks from low level with bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker to try the instantaneous fuses for a couple of months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued the use of the instantaneous fuses. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS "Pruth", a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck; but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, and bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. "Ken was okay," Kenney later recalled. "He was stubborn, over-sensitive, and a prima donna, but he worked like a dog all the time. His gang liked him a lot but he tended to get a staff of 'yes-men'. He did not like to delegate authority. I was afraid that Ken was not durable enough to last very long under the high tension of this show."

In December, Kenney learned that Whitehead had been on board a <a href="B-25">B-25</a> in which a Japanese antiaircraft gun had blown a hole in the wing "big enough for him to jump through without touching the sides", and that Walker had flown on a B-17 that had clipped a tree and lost part of a wing. Kenney then repeated his earlier order, explaining the reasons behind it:
On 9 January 1943, MacArthur issued a communiqué praising the forces under his command for the victory that had been achieved at Buna and announcing the award of the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> to twelve officers, including Walker.

On 3 January 1943, Kenney received intelligence from Allied <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> codebreakers that the Japanese were about to <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">attempt a reinforcement run</a> from their main base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> to <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, on the mainland of New Guinea. He ordered Walker to carry out a full-scale dawn attack on the harbor's shipping before it could depart. Walker demurred. His bombers would have difficulty making their rendezvous if they had to leave Port Moresby in the dark. He recommended a noon attack instead. Kenney acknowledged Walker's concerns but was insistent; he preferred bombers out of formation to bombers shot down by the enemy fighters that were certain to intercept a daylight attack. In spite of this, Walker ordered that the attack be made at noon on 5 January.
Bad weather over northern Australia prevented participation by the bombers there, which left Walker with only those based at Port Moresby: six B-17s and six <a href="B-24">B-24</a>s. This force was far too small for the tactics that he wanted to use. He flew in the lead plane, B-17 #41-24458, nicknamed "San Antonio Rose I", from the <a href="64th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">64th Bombardment Squadron</a>, <a href="43d%20Operations%20Group">43rd Bombardment Group</a>, which was piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jack W. Bleasdale, the group's executive officer. The 64th Bombardment Squadron's commanding officer, Major Allen Lindberg was also on board. The briefing officer for the mission, Major David Hassemer, did not think that it was a good idea for so many senior officers to fly in the same plane, but his objection was overruled.

They encountered heavy flak and continuous fighter attacks. Owing to the delay, the ten-ship convoy that they were sent to attack had departed two hours earlier, but there were still plenty of targets. Forty and twenty four bombs were dropped from . The mission claimed hits on nine ships, totaling 50,000 tons. After the war, <a href="JANAC">JANAC</a> confirmed the sinking of only one Japanese merchant ship, the 5,833-ton "Keifuku Maru". Two other ships were damaged, as was the destroyer . Two B-17s were shot down, including Walker's.

Fred Wesche flew the 5 January mission over Rabaul. He later recalled:

Kenney was furious when he discovered that Walker had not only changed the takeoff time without notice, but had also defied his orders by accompanying the mission. He told MacArthur that when Walker showed up he was going to give him a reprimand and send him back to Australia on leave for two weeks. "Alright George," MacArthur replied, "but if he doesn't come back, I'm going to send his name in to Washington recommending him for a Congressional Medal of Honor." All available aircraft were sent to search for Walker, preventing attacks on the Japanese convoy as it headed for Lae. They managed to locate and rescue the crew of the other B-17 that had been shot down in the raid, but not Walker's.

MacArthur's recommendation therefore went ahead. The Adjutant General, Major General <a href="James%20Alexander%20Ulio">James A. Ulio</a>, queried whether it was "considered above and beyond the call of duty for the commanding officer of a bomber command to accompany it on bombing missions against enemy held territory." Major General <a href="George%20Stratemeyer">George Stratemeyer</a>, the chief of the air staff, replied that it was. In March 1943, Roosevelt presented Kenneth Walker Jr. with the medal in a ceremony at the White House. It was one of 38 Medals of Honor awarded to flying personnel of the US Army Air Forces in World War II. The citation read: 

Neither Walker's body nor the wreck of his aircraft was found. Walker was therefore listed on the Tablets of the Missing at <a href="Manila%20American%20Cemetery%20and%20Memorial">Manila American Cemetery and Memorial</a>, Philippines, where servicemen <a href="missing%20in%20action">missing in action</a> or buried at sea in the Southwest Pacific are commemorated. On 7 December 2001, a headstone marker was erected in Section MC-36M of <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> to give family members a place to gather in the United States.

General Walker's military awards include:

In January 1948, Roswell Army Air Field in Roswell, New Mexico, was renamed <a href="Walker%20Air%20Force%20Base">Walker Air Force Base</a> in honor of Walker. The base was inactivated on 2 July 1965 and closed on 30 June 1967. Walker Hall, and its Walker Air Power Room, at Maxwell Air Force Base, home of the <a href="Air%20Force%20Doctrine%20Development%20and%20Education%20Center">Air Force Doctrine Development and Education Center</a>, are also named after him. The Walker Papers is an Air Force Fellows program that annually honors the top three research papers produced by Air Force Fellows with the Walker Series award. The Walker Series recognizes the contributions each Fellow has made to research supporting air and space power and its use in the implementation of US strategic policy.
