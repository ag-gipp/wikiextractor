Georges Bizet

Georges Bizet (; 25 October 18383 June 1875), registered at birth as Alexandre César Léopold Bizet, was a French composer of the <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic era</a>. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>", which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.

During a brilliant student career at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a> in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—"<a href="Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles">Les pêcheurs de perles</a>" and "<a href="La%20jolie%20fille%20de%20Perth">La jolie fille de Perth</a>"—were immediately successful.

After the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870–1871, during which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera "<a href="Djamileh">Djamileh</a>", though an orchestral suite derived from his <a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28Bizet%29">incidental music</a> to <a href="Alphonse%20Daudet">Alphonse Daudet</a>'s play "L'Arlésienne" was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, "Carmen", was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.

Bizet's marriage to <a href="Genevi%C3%A8ve%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Geneviève Halévy</a> was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from "Carmen", was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.

Georges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838. He was registered as Alexandre César Léopold, but baptised as "Georges" on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life. His father, Adolphe Bizet, had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training. He also composed a few works, including at least one published song. In 1837, Adolphe married Aimée Delsarte, against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect; the Delsartes, though impoverished, were a cultured and highly musical family. Aimée was an accomplished pianist, while her brother <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Delsarte">François Delsarte</a> was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe</a> and <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>. François Delsarte's wife Rosine, a musical prodigy, had been an assistant professor of <a href="solfeggio">solfège</a> at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a> at the age of 13. At least one author has alleged that his mother was from a Jewish family but this is not substantiated in any of his official biographies.

Georges, an only child, showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chordal structures</a>. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by <a href="Joseph%20Meifred">Joseph Meifred</a>, the <a href="French%20horn">horn</a> virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.

Bizet was admitted to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848, two weeks before his 10th birthday. He made an early impression; within six months he had won first prize in solfège, a feat that impressed <a href="Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume%20Zimmerman">Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman</a>, the Conservatoire's former professor of piano. Zimmerman gave Bizet private lessons in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and <a href="fugue">fugue</a>, which continued until the old man's death in 1853. Through these classes, Bizet met Zimmerman's son-in-law, the composer <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a>, who became a lasting influence on the young pupil's musical style—although their relationship was often strained in later years. He also met another of Gounod's young students, the 13-year-old <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, who remained a firm friend of Bizet's. Under the tuition of <a href="Antoine%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marmontel">Antoine François Marmontel</a>, the Conservatoire's professor of piano, Bizet's pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire's second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: "In your class one learns something besides the piano; one becomes a musician". 

Bizet's first preserved compositions, two wordless songs for <a href="soprano">soprano</a>, date from around 1850. In 1853, he joined <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>'s composition class and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality. Two of his songs, "Petite Marguerite" and "La Rose et l'abeille", were published in 1854. In 1855, he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra, and prepared four-hand piano versions of two of Gounod's works: the opera "<a href="La%20nonne%20sanglante">La nonne sanglante</a>" and the Symphony in D. Bizet's work on the Gounod symphony inspired him, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, to write <a href="Symphony%20in%20C%20%28Bizet%29">his own symphony</a>, which bore a close resemblance to Gounod's—note for note in some passages. Bizet's symphony was subsequently lost, rediscovered in 1933 and finally performed in 1935.

In 1856, Bizet competed for the prestigious <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>. His entry was not successful, but nor were any of the others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year. After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera competition which <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a> had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 <a href="franc%23French%20franc">francs</a>. The challenge was to set the one-act <a href="libretto">libretto</a> of "<a href="Le%20docteur%20Miracle">Le docteur Miracle</a>" by Léon Battu and <a href="Ludovic%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Ludovic Halévy</a>. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and <a href="Charles%20Lecocq">Charles Lecocq</a>, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury's manipulation by Fromental Halévy in favour of Bizet. As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>, who presented the young man with a signed photograph. Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that "Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, he has all the virtues".

For his 1857 Prix de Rome entry, Bizet, with Gounod's enthusiastic approval, chose to set the <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "Clovis et Clotilde" by Amédée Burion. Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Académie des Beaux-Arts</a> overturned the judges' initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only other requirement was the submission each year of an "envoi", a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Académie. Before his departure for Rome in December 1857, Bizet's prize cantata was performed at the Académie to an enthusiastic reception.

On 27 January 1858, Bizet arrived at the <a href="Villa%20Medici">Villa Medici</a>, a 16th-century palace that since 1803 had housed the French Académie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as "paradise". Under its director, the painter <a href="Jean-Victor%20Schnetz">Jean-Victor Schnetz</a>, the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow-laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours. Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere, and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life; in his first six months in Rome, his only composition was a "<a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>" written for the Rodrigues Prize, a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners. This piece failed to impress the judges, who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe, the only other entrant. Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music. His "Te Deum" remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971.

Through the winter of 1858–59, Bizet worked on his first envoi, an <a href="opera%20buffa">opera buffa</a> setting of Carlo Cambiaggio's libretto "<a href="Don%20Procopio">Don Procopio</a>". Under the terms of his prize, Bizet's first envoi was supposed to be a mass, but after his "Te Deum" experience, he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Académie, but their response to "Don Procopio" was initially positive, with praise for the composer's "easy and brilliant touch" and "youthful and bold style".

For his second envoi, not wishing to test the Académie's tolerance too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by <a href="Horace">Horace</a>. This work, entitled "Carmen Saeculare", was intended as a song to <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to "Carmen Saeculare", he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of <a href="Odysseus%23Journey%20home%20to%20Ithaca">Ulysses and Circe</a>. After "Don Procopio", Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem "Vasco da Gama". This replaced "Carmen Saeculare" as his second envoi, and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.

In the summer of 1859, Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around <a href="Anagni">Anagni</a> and <a href="Frosinone">Frosinone</a>. They also visited a convict settlement at <a href="Anzio">Anzio</a>; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences. In August, he made an extended journey south to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: "Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils..." Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his <a href="Roma%20Symphony%20%28Bizet%29">"Roma" symphony</a>, was not finished until 1868. On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete "an important work" (which has not been identified). In September 1860, while visiting <a href="Venice">Venice</a> with his friend and fellow-laureate <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a>, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.

Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, <a href="Paris%20Opera">the Opéra</a> and the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for <a href="operetta">operetta</a>, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Italienne">Théâtre Italien</a> specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Lyrique">Théâtre Lyrique</a> company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Carvalho">Léon Carvalho</a>. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>" and his "<a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20et%20Juliette">Roméo et Juliette</a>", and of a shortened version of <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>'s "<a href="Les%20Troyens">Les Troyens</a>".

On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s opera "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>", a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential <a href="Jockey-Club%20de%20Paris">Jockey-Club de Paris</a>. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner "above and beyond all living composers". Thereafter, accusations of "Wagnerism" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.

As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent "as though it were a vice". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: "I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficulties ... there are three, and ... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant."
Bizet's third envoi was delayed for nearly a year by the prolonged illness and death, in September 1861, of his mother. He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works: an overture entitled "La Chasse d'Ossian", a scherzo and a funeral march. The overture has been lost; the scherzo was later absorbed into the "Roma" symphony, and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera. Bizet's fourth and final envoi, which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, "La guzla de l'émir". As a state-subsidised theatre, the Opéra-Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and "La guzla" duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from <a href="Count%20Alexandre%20Joseph%20Colonna-Walewski">Count Walewski</a>, to compose the music for a three-act opera. This was "<a href="Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles">Les pêcheurs de perles</a>", based on a libretto by <a href="Michel%20Carr%C3%A9">Michel Carré</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Cormon">Eugène Cormon</a>. Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer's first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew "La guzla" from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera. The first performance of "Les pêcheurs de perles", by the Théâtre Lyrique company, was on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it "does M. Bizet the greatest honour". Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera's run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886.

In 1862, Bizet had fathered a child with the family's housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up to believe that he was Adolphe Bizet's child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son's true paternity.

When his Prix de Rome grant expired, Bizet found he could not make a living from writing music. He accepted piano pupils and some composition students, two of whom, Edmond Galabert and <a href="Paul%20Lacombe">Paul Lacombe</a>, became his close friends. He also worked as an accompanist at rehearsals and auditions for various staged works, including Berlioz's oratorio "<a href="L%27enfance%20du%20Christ">L'enfance du Christ</a>" and Gounod's opera "<a href="Mireille%20%28opera%29">Mireille</a>". However, his main work in this period was as an arranger of others' works. He made piano transcriptions for hundreds of operas and other pieces and prepared vocal scores and orchestral arrangements for all kinds of music. He was also, briefly, a music critic for "La Revue Nationale et Étrangère", under the assumed name of "Gaston de Betzi". Bizet's single contribution in this capacity appeared on 3 August 1867, after which he quarrelled with the magazine's new editor and resigned.

Since 1862, Bizet had been working intermittently on "Ivan IV", an opera based on the life of <a href="Ivan%20the%20Terrible">Ivan the Terrible</a>. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the Opéra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946. In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for "<a href="La%20jolie%20fille%20de%20Perth">La jolie fille de Perth</a>", the libretto for which, by J.H. Vernoy de Saint-Georges after <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>, is described by Bizet's biographer <a href="Winton%20Dean">Winton Dean</a> as "the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set". Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Théâtre Lyrique on 26 December 1867. Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet's other operas; "Le Ménestral's" critic hailed the second act as "a masterpiece from beginning to end". Despite the opera's success, Carvalho's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.

While "La jolie fille" was in rehearsal, Bizet worked with three other composers, each of whom contributed a single act to a four-act operetta "Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre". When the work was performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée on 13 December 1867, it was a great success, and the "Revue et Gazette Musicale's" critic lavished particular praise on Bizet's act: "Nothing could be more stylish, smarter and, at the same time, more distinguished". Bizet also found time to finish his long-gestating "Roma" symphony and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs. Nevertheless, this period of Bizet's life was marked by significant disappointments. At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done. Several competition entries, including a cantata and a hymn composed for the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281867%29">Paris Exhibition of 1867</a>, were unsuccessful. "La Coupe du Roi de Thulé", his entry for an opera competition, was not placed in the first five; from the fragments of this score that survive, analysts have discerned pre-echoes of "Carmen". On 28 February 1869, the "Roma" symphony was performed at the Cirque Napoléon, under <a href="Jules%20Pasdeloup">Jules Pasdeloup</a>. Afterwards, Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause, hisses, and catcalls, the work was a success.

Not long after Fromental Halévy's death in 1862, Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera "<a href="No%C3%A9%20%28opera%29">Noé</a>". Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter <a href="Genevi%C3%A8ve%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Geneviève</a>, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: "I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: "penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from "a family bristling with artists and eccentrics". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: "Bizet has spirit and talent. He "should" succeed".

As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the "Noé" manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund "Vasco da Gama" and "Ivan IV" were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and "Noé" remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: "Clarissa Harlowe" based on <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>'s novel "<a href="Clarissa">Clarissa</a>", and "Grisélidis" with a libretto from <a href="Victorien%20Sardou">Victorien Sardou</a>. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>.

After a series of perceived provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenzollern">Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern</a>, the French Emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which he was supposed to fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan%20%281870%29">Sedan</a> on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the <a href="Second%20Empire%20%28France%29">Second Empire</a> came to a sudden end.

Bizet greeted with enthusiasm the proclamation in Paris of the <a href="Third%20Republic%20%28France%29">Third Republic</a>.
The new government did not sue for peace, and by 17 September, the Prussian armies had surrounded Paris. Unlike Gounod, who fled to England, Bizet rejected opportunities to leave the besieged city: "I can't leave Paris! It's impossible! It would be quite simply an act of cowardice", he wrote to Mme Halévy. Life in the city became frugal and harsh, although, by October, there were efforts to re-establish normality. Pasdeloup resumed his regular Sunday concerts, and on 5 November, the Opéra reopened with excerpts from works by Gluck, Rossini, and Meyerbeer.

An armistice was signed on 26 January 1871, but the departure of the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance. Following an uprising, the city's municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a>. Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and Geneviève escaped to <a href="Compi%C3%A8gne">Compiègne</a>. Later, they moved to <a href="Le%20V%C3%A9sinet">Le Vésinet</a> where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: "The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence", Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.

As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Perrin">Émile Perrin</a>. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of <a href="Ernest%20Reyer">Ernest Reyer</a>'s opera "Erostrate" after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on "Clarissa Harlowe" and "Grisélidis", but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled "Jeux d'enfants", and a one-act opera, "<a href="Djamileh">Djamileh</a>", which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques.

Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for <a href="Alphonse%20Daudet">Alphonse Daudet</a>'s play "<a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28novel%20and%20play%29">L'Arlésienne</a>". When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a>, Bizet fashioned <a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28Bizet%29">a four-movement suite</a> from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's "Roméo et Juliette" at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: "You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you".

In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: "I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic] Halévy are doing my piece". The subject chosen for this project was <a href="Prosper%20M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e">Prosper Mérimée</a>'s short novel, "<a href="Carmen%20%28novella%29">Carmen</a>". Bizet began the music in the summer of 1873, but the Opéra-Comique's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqué story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended. Bizet then began composing "Don Rodrigue", an adaptation of the <a href="El%20Cid">El Cid</a> story by <a href="Louis%20Gallet">Louis Gallet</a> and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Blau">Édouard Blau</a>. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Opéra's principal baritone <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Faure">Jean-Baptiste Faure</a>, hoping that the singer's approval might influence the directors of the Opéra to stage the work. However, on the night of 28–29 October, the Opéra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set "Don Rodrigue" aside. It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, "Patrie".

<a href="Adolphe%20de%20Leuven">Adolphe de Leuven</a>, the co-director of the Opéra-Comique most bitterly opposed to the "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>" project, resigned early in 1874, removing the main barrier to the work's production. Bizet finished the score during the summer and was pleased with the outcome: "I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody". The renowned mezzo-soprano <a href="C%C3%A9lestine%20Galli-Mari%C3%A9">Célestine Galli-Marié</a> (known professionally as "Galli-Marié") was engaged to sing the title role. According to Dean, she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it. There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair; his relations with Geneviève were strained at this time, and they lived apart for several months.

When rehearsals began in October 1874, the orchestra had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable. The chorus likewise declared some of their music impossible to sing and were dismayed that they had to act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line. Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the Opéra-Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper. Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way. Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning, by chance, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> was announced.

Among leading musical figures at the premiere were <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Jules Massenet</a>, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, suffering from an abscess in her right eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained of a lack of melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Auber</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Adrien%20Boieldieu">Boieldieu</a>. Léon Escudier in "L'Art Musical" called the music "dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20de%20Banville">Théodore de Banville</a>, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".

For most of his life, Bizet had suffered from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert that he had been very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: "I suffered like a dog". In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing "Carmen", he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as "throat angina", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875. At that time, depressed by the evident failure of "Carmen", Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at <a href="Bougival">Bougival</a> and, feeling a little better, went for a swim in the <a href="River%20Seine">Seine</a>. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but in the early hours of 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack. He was 36 years old.

The suddenness of Bizet's death, and awareness of his depressed mental state, fuelled rumours of suicide. Although the exact cause of death was never settled with certainty, physicians discounted such theories and eventually determined the cause as "a cardiac complication of acute articular rheumatism". News of the death stunned Paris's musical world; as Galli-Marié was too upset to appear, that evening's performance of "Carmen" was cancelled and replaced with <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Adrien%20Boieldieu">Boieldieu</a>'s "<a href="La%20dame%20blanche">La dame blanche</a>".

At the funeral on 5 June at the <a href="%C3%89glise%20de%20la%20Sainte-Trinit%C3%A9%2C%20Paris">Église de la Sainte-Trinité</a> in <a href="Montmartre">Montmartre</a>, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who included Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played "Patrie", and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from "Carmen". At the burial which followed at the <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet had been struck down just as he was becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final <a href="peroration">peroration</a>. After a special performance of "Carmen" at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.

Bizet's earliest compositions, chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises, give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist. Dean sees evidence in the piano work "Romance sans parole", written before 1854, of "the conjunction of melody, rhythm and accompaniment" that is characteristic of Bizet's mature works. Bizet's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini's "<a href="William%20Tell%20%28opera%29">Guillaume Tell</a>". Critics have found it unremarkable, but the <a href="Symphony%20in%20C%20%28Bizet%29">Symphony in C</a> of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert. In Dean's view, the symphony has "few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth". The critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> suggests that Bizet may at this time have thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music, before an "inner voice" (and the realities of the French musical world) turned him towards the stage.

After his early Symphony in C, Bizet's purely orchestral output is sparse. The "Roma" symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly, in Dean's view, with its juvenile predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod and contains passages that recall <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Weber</a> and <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; he calls it a "misfire". Bizet's other mature orchestral work, the overture "Patrie", is similarly dismissed: "an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism". The musicologist <a href="Hugh%20Macdonald">Hugh Macdonald</a> argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived respectively from the piano work "Jeux d'enfants" and the incidental music for "L'Arlésienne". In these, he demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.

Bizet's piano works have not entered the concert pianist's repertoire, and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt. An exception is the set of 12 pieces evoking the world of children's games, "Jeux d'enfants", written for four hands. Here, Bizet avoided the virtuoso passages which tend to dominate his solo works. The earlier solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin; later works, such as the "Variations Chromatiques" and the "Chasse Fantastique", owe more to Liszt. Most of Bizet's songs were written in the period 1866–68. Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse, and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice. Much of Bizet's larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early "Te Deum", which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as "a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet's unfitness to write religious music."

Bizet's early one-act opera "Le docteur Miracle" provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements in many of his earliest works: "[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved." Until "Carmen", however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizetti</a>, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.

In "Don Procopio", Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in "<a href="Don%20Pasquale">Don Pasquale</a>", a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet's fingerprints emerge unmistakably. In his first significant opera, "Les pêcheurs de perles", Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, the music in Dean's view rises at times "far above the level of contemporary French opera". Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the <a href="cavatina">cavatina</a>" Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre" played by two <a href="French%20horns">French horns</a> over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst <a href="Herv%C3%A9%20Lacombe">Hervé Lacombe</a>, "resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest". While the music of "Les pêcheurs" is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera's Eastern setting, in "La jolie fille de Perth", Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood, though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera's Act III seduction scene.

From Bizet's unfinished works, Macdonald highlights "La coupe du roi de Thulé" as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in "Carmen" and suggests that had "Clarissa Harlowe" and "Grisélidis" been completed, Bizet's legacy would have been "infinitely richer". As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera, he encountered critical hostility. In the case of "Djamileh", the accusation of "Wagnerism" was raised again, as audiences struggled to understand the score's originality; many found the music pretentious and monotonous, lacking in both rhythm and melody. By contrast, modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that "Djamileh" is "a truly enchanting piece, full of inventive touches, especially of chromatic colour."

Ralph P. Locke, in his study of "Carmen's" origins, draws attention to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his "History of Western Music", praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, and particularly Wagner, who commented: "Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head." Another champion of the work was <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, who claimed to know it by heart; "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere". By broad consent, "Carmen" represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of <a href="op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéra comique</a>.

After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even "Carmen" was altered into <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a> format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from "Carmen" and the "L'Arlésienne" suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw an increase of interest. "Don Procopio" was revived in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a> in 1906; an Italian version of "Les pêcheurs de perles" was performed at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York on 13 November 1916, with <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Caruso</a> in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses. After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>. Excerpts from "La coupe du roi de Thulé", edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> on 12 July 1955, and "Le docteur Miracle" was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group. "Vasco da Gama" and "Ivan IV" have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music. "Carmen", after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878). It has been hailed as the first opera of the <a href="verismo">verismo</a> school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life—"not idealised life but life as actually lived".

The music critic <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> surmises that, had Bizet lived, he might have revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a> who, according to Dean, developed the idea "till it became threadbare". Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Chabrier</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a> as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in "L'Arlésienne", José in "Carmen"—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">B minor ""Pathetique""</a>. Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. "The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction."

In Bizet's family circle, his father Adolphe died in 1886. Bizet's son Jacques committed suicide in 1922 after an unhappy love affair. Jean Reiter, Bizet's elder son, had a successful career as press director of "<a href="Le%20Temps%20%28Paris%29">Le Temps</a>", became an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and died in 1939 at the age of 77. In 1886, Geneviève married Émile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>. She showed little interest in her first husband's musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs. She died in 1926; in her will, she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had "produced a remarkable work within the previous five years". Winners of the prize include <a href="Tony%20Aubin">Tony Aubin</a>, <a href="Jean-Michel%20Damase">Jean-Michel Damase</a>, <a href="Henri%20Dutilleux">Henri Dutilleux</a>, and <a href="Jean%20Martinon">Jean Martinon</a>.

John Barrymore

John Sidney Barrymore (<a href="Name%20at%20birth">né</a> Blyth; February 15, 1882 – May 29, 1942) was an American actor on stage, screen and radio. A member of the <a href="Barrymore%20family">Drew and Barrymore theatrical families</a>, he initially tried to avoid the stage, and briefly attempted a career as an artist, but appeared on stage together with his father <a href="Maurice%20Barrymore">Maurice</a> in 1900, and then his sister <a href="Ethel%20Barrymore">Ethel</a> the following year. He began his career in 1903 and first gained attention as a stage actor in light comedy, then high drama, culminating in productions of "<a href="Justice%20%28play%29">Justice</a>" (1916), "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" (1920) and "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" (1922); his portrayal of Hamlet led to him being called the "greatest living American tragedian".

After a success as "Hamlet" in London in 1925, Barrymore left the stage for 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> era, he was well received in such pictures as "<a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281920%20film%29">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>" (1920), "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes%20%281922%20film%29">Sherlock Holmes</a>" (1922) and "<a href="The%20Sea%20Beast">The Sea Beast</a>" (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>s were introduced, and three of his works, "<a href="Grand%20Hotel%20%281932%20film%29">Grand Hotel</a>" (1932), "<a href="Twentieth%20Century%20%28film%29">Twentieth Century</a>" (1934) and "<a href="Midnight%20%281939%20film%29">Midnight</a>" (1939) have been inducted into the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>.

Barrymore's personal life has been the subject of much attention before and since his death. He struggled with alcohol abuse from the age of 14, was married and divorced four times, and declared bankruptcy later in life. Much of his later work involved self-parody and the portrayal of drunken has-beens. His obituary in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" observed that "with the passing of the years – and as his private life became more public – he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character." Although film historians have opined that Barrymore's "contribution to the art of cinematic acting began to fade" after the mid-1930s, Barrymore's biographer, Martin Norden, considers him to be "perhaps the most influential and idolized actor of his day".

Barrymore was born John Sidney Blyth in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and was known by family and friends as "Jack". Although the Barrymore <a href="Family%20Bible%20%28book%29">family Bible</a> puts his date of birth as February 15, 1882, his birth certificate shows February 14. He was the youngest of three children. His siblings were <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel</a> (1878–1954), and <a href="Ethel%20Barrymore">Ethel</a> (1879–1959). His father was <a href="Maurice%20Barrymore">Maurice Barrymore</a>, an Indian-born British actor who had been born Herbert Blyth, and had adopted Barrymore as a stage name after seeing it on a poster in the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</a> in London. Barrymore's mother, <a href="Georgiana%20Drew">Georgie Drew Barrymore</a>, was born into a prominent <a href="Barrymore%20family">theatrical family</a>. Barrymore's maternal grandparents were <a href="Louisa%20Lane%20Drew">Louisa Lane Drew</a>, a well-known 19th-century American actress and the manager of the Arch Street Theatre, and <a href="John%20Drew%20%28actor%29">John Drew</a>, also an actor whose specialty was comedy. Barrymore's maternal uncles were two more thespians, <a href="John%20Drew%2C%20Jr.">John Drew, Jr.</a> and <a href="Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Sidney%20Drew">Sidney</a>.

Much of Barrymore's early life was unsettled. In October 1882, the family toured in the US for a season with Polish actress <a href="Helena%20Modjeska">Helena Modjeska</a>. The following year his parents toured again with Modjeska but left the children behind. Modjeska was influential in the family, and she insisted that all three children be baptized into the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. In 1884 the family traveled to London as part of <a href="Augustin%20Daly">Augustin Daly</a>'s theatrical company, returning to the US two years later. As a child, Barrymore was sometimes badly behaved, and he was sent away to schools in an attempt to instill discipline. The strategy was not always successful, and he attended elementary schools in four states. He was sent first to the boys' annex of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One punishment that he received there was being made to read a copy of <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Inferno%20%28Dante%29">Inferno</a>"; he later recounted that, as he looked at the illustrations by <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>, "my interest was aroused, and a new urge was born within me. I wanted to be an artist". He was expelled from the school in 1891 and was sent to <a href="Seton%20Hall%20Preparatory%20School">Seton Hall Preparatory School</a> in New Jersey, where Lionel was already studying. Barrymore was unhappy at Seton and was soon withdrawn, after which he attended several public schools in New York, including the <a href="Mt.%20Pleasant%20Military%20Academy">Mount Pleasant Military Academy</a>.

In 1892, his grandmother Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she lost control of her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by his grandmother. The loss of their mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at <a href="The%20Lambs">The Lambs</a>, a New York actors' club.

In 1895, Barrymore entered <a href="Georgetown%20Preparatory%20School">Georgetown Preparatory School</a>, then located on Georgetown University Campus, but he was expelled in November 1897, probably after being caught waiting in a <a href="brothel">brothel</a>. One of his biographers, Michael A. Morrison, posits the alternate theory that Barrymore was expelled after the staff saw him inebriated. By the time he left Georgetown he was, according to Martin Norden in his biography of Barrymore, "already in the early stages of a chronic drinking problem". 1897 was an emotionally challenging year for Barrymore: he lost his virginity when he was seduced by his step-mother, Mamie Floyd, and in August his grandmother, the main female role model in his life, died.

Barrymore traveled with his father to England in 1898, where he joined <a href="King%27s%20College%20School">King's College School</a>, <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a>. A year later he joined the <a href="Slade%20School%20of%20Fine%20Art">Slade School of Fine Art</a>, to study literature and art. After a year of formal study, he left and "devoted much of his subsequent stay in London to bohemianism and nocturnal adventures", according to his biographer <a href="Margot%20Peters">Margot Peters</a>. Barrymore returned to New York in the summer of 1900, and by November he found work as an illustrator on "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">The New York Evening Journal</a>", at a salary of $50 a week.
Barrymore had always professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded by his father to join him on stage for a few performances of a short play, "A Man of the World". He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, rather than as a possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines" when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped in the middle of his dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, "I've blown up. Where do we go from here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.

An incident in 1901 had a major impact on Barrymore. In March, his father had a mental breakdown as a result of <a href="tertiary%20syphilis">tertiary syphilis</a>, and Barrymore took him to <a href="Bellevue%20Hospital%20Center">Bellevue hospital</a>. He was later transferred to a private institution in <a href="Amityville%2C%20New%20York">Amityville</a>, Long Island, where he suffered a "rapid descent into madness". The "Encyclopedia of World Biography" states that Barrymore was constantly "haunted by the bright and dark spell of his father", and his close friend <a href="Gene%20Fowler">Gene Fowler</a> reported that "the bleak overtone of this breaking of his parent's reason never quite died away in Barrymore's mind, and he was haunted by fears he would suffer the same fate". The same year, Barrymore began an affair with a beautiful <a href="Gibson%20Girl">artists' model</a>, ""<a href="Florodora">Florodora</a>" girl" and aspiring actress named <a href="Evelyn%20Nesbit">Evelyn Nesbit</a>, who was a mistress of architect <a href="Stanford%20White">Stanford White</a>. Barrymore later described Nesbit as "the most maddening woman. ... She was the first woman I ever loved", and he proposed marriage to her. Nesbit's mother did not think that, as a struggling artist, Barrymore was a good match for her daughter. To break off their relationship her mother sent Nesbit away to school in New Jersey. In 1906, White was shot in public by Nesbit's then-husband, <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> millionaire <a href="Harry%20K.%20Thaw">Harry K. Thaw</a>. Barrymore expected to testify at Thaw's murder trial on the issue of Nesbit's morality; he worried that he might be asked whether he had arranged for Nesbit to have an <a href="abortion">abortion</a>, disguised as an <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a>, even though Nesbit had undergone two previous "appendectomies". Barrymore was never called as a witness because Thaw pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

In May 1902, Barrymore was fired from his newspaper position after producing a poor illustration for the paper while hung over. He spent time as a poster designer but realized it was not lucrative enough for his lifestyle, which was being partly financed by Ethel, who was also paying for their father's care. While discussing his future with his brother, Barrymore said "it looks as though I'll have to succumb to the family curse, acting", and he later admitted that "there isn't any romance about how I went on stage. ... I needed the money."
Barrymore began to contact his family's theatrical connections to find work and approached <a href="Charles%20Frohman">Charles Frohman</a>, who had been the producer of "Captain Jinks" and had also been an employer of Barrymore's mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed more experience before making a <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in "Magda", and in November when the troupe produced "Leah the Forsaken", he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.

A year later Barrymore appeared in his first Broadway production, in a small role in the comedy "Glad of It", which only had a short run. Afterwards he played the role of Charles Hyne in the farce "The Dictator" at the Criterion Theatre, which starred <a href="William%20Collier%2C%20Sr.">William Collier</a>. During the play's run and subsequent tour across the US, Collier became a mentor to the young actor, although his patience was continually tested by Barrymore's drinking, which led to occasional missed performances, drunken stage appearances, and general misbehavior. Collier taught Barrymore much about acting, including coaching him in comic timing, but "at times regretted his sponsorship" of his apprentice. In March 1905, while "The Dictator" was playing in Buffalo, Barrymore's father died in Amityville and was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Philadelphia. At the close of the US tour, "The Dictator" visited Britain from April 1905, where it played at the <a href="Harold%20Pinter%20Theatre">Comedy Theatre</a>. The critic for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" wrote that Barrymore "admirably seconded" Collier.

When he returned to America, Barrymore appeared at the Criterion Theatre in a double bill of works by <a href="J.%20M.%20Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a>; he played a clown in "Pantaloon" opposite his brother, and Stephen Rollo in "Alice Sit-by-the-Fire" opposite his sister. Both plays ran for 81 performances from December 1905, and then went on tour. Barrymore continued drinking and lacked discipline, which affected his performances. Ethel was angry with her brother and had the producers fire him from the show, but re-hire him the following day, to teach him a lesson. After a tour of the US and Australia with Collier in "On the Quiet" and "The Dictator", Barrymore joined his sister in the 1907 comedy "His Excellency the Governor" at the <a href="Empire%20Theatre%20%2841st%20Street%29">Empire Theatre</a>. He received mixed reviews for his performances, and "<a href="The%20Wichita%20Eagle">The Wichita Daily Eagle</a>" commented that "Barrymore seems to imitate John Drew too much ever to be a good actor. Why doesn't young Barrymore imitate a real actor if he must copy someone."
Barrymore gained his first leading role in early 1907, in the comedy "The Boys of Company B" at the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Lyceum Theatre</a>. Although he was well received by the critics – "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" noted that "his work has been pronounced astonishingly clever by the critics wherever he played" – at times he continued his unprofessional stage behavior, which led to a rebuke from John Drew, who attended a performance. After a short run in "Toddles" at the <a href="Garrick%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Garrick Theatre</a>, Barrymore was given the lead role of Mac in "<a href="Stubborn%20Cinderella">A Stubborn Cinderella</a>", both on tour and at the Broadway Theatre in Boston. He had previously been earning $50 a week during his sporadic employment but now enjoyed a wage increase to $175. He briefly appeared in "The Candy Shop" in mid-1909, before he played the lead role in <a href="Winchell%20Smith">Winchell Smith</a>'s play "The Fortune Hunter" at the <a href="Gaiety%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Gaiety Theatre</a> in September the same year. It was his longest-held role, running for 345 performances until May 1911, initially at the Gaiety Theatre in New York, and then on tour. The critic for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" thought the play was, "acted with fine comedy spirit by John Barrymore ... [who] gave indisputable signs last night of grown and growing powers."

In mid-1910 Barrymore met socialite <a href="Katherine%20Corri%20Harris">Katherine Corri Harris</a>, and the couple married in September that year. Harris' father objected to the relationship and refused to attend the wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, "The Dictator" went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore "began to think of his marriage as a 'bus accident. Film critic <a href="Hollis%20Alpert">Hollis Alpert</a> wrote that, within a week of the wedding, Katherine was complaining that she saw her new husband too infrequently. Barrymore's increasing <a href="Alcoholism">dependence on alcohol</a> was also a cause of marital problems, and he explained that "unhappiness increased the drink, and drink increased the unhappiness".
Barrymore's next two plays – "Uncle Sam" and "Princess Zim-Zim", both from 1911 – were critically and commercially weak, but the second work introduced him to playwright <a href="Edward%20Sheldon">Edward Sheldon</a>, who would "reshape ... [Barrymore's] entire career". In January 1912, Barrymore appeared together with his sister in "A Slice of Life" at the Empire Theatre on Broadway, which ran for 48 performances. Charles Darnton, a critic for "<a href="The%20Evening%20World">The Evening World</a>", observed that "Barrymore takes delight in 'kidding' his part not only to the limit, but perhaps beyond". A review in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" stated that "Barrymore inimitably imitates his uncle John Drew".

Barrymore may have appeared in his first films in 1912. In four short films, a cast member is listed as "Jack Barrymore"; this is probably John Barrymore, although Norden notes that "we may never know for certain if [these] are in fact Barrymore movies." The four films were "Dream of a Motion Picture Director", "<a href="The%20Widow%20Casey%27s%20Return">The Widow Casey's Return</a>", "<a href="A%20Prize%20Package">A Prize Package</a>" (all 1912) and "<a href="One%20on%20Romance">One on Romance</a>" (1913). The films were produced by the Philadelphia-based <a href="Lubin%20Manufacturing%20Company">Lubin Manufacturing Company</a> and were <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> in an explosion and fire at the Lubin vaults in 1914.

In July 1912, Barrymore went to Los Angeles, where he appeared in three short-running plays at the Belasco Theatre. He returned to New York in October, where he took the lead role in 72 performances of the comedy "<a href="The%20Affairs%20of%20Anatol">The Affairs of Anatol</a>" at the <a href="Helen%20Hayes%20Theatre">Little Theatre</a>. Although the critical response was lukewarm, Barrymore's salary for the play was $600 a week. He began the following year by appearing in a short run of "<a href="A%20Gentleman%20of%20Leisure">A Thief for a Night</a>" in McVicker's Theatre, Chicago, before returning to New York, and the Thirty-Ninth St. Theatre, for a two-month run in "Believe Me Xantippe".

In late 1913, Barrymore made his first confirmed feature film, the romantic comedy "<a href="An%20American%20Citizen">An American Citizen</a>", with <a href="Adolph%20Zukor">Adolph Zukor</a>'s <a href="Famous%20Players%20Film%20Company">Famous Players Film Company</a>. When the film was released in January 1914, Barrymore "delighted movie audiences with an inimitable light touch that made a conventional romance 'joyous'," writes Peters. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Oregon%20Journal">The Oregon Daily Journal</a>" thought that Barrymore gave a "portrayal of unusual quality". The success of the picture led to further film work, including "<a href="The%20Man%20from%20Mexico">The Man from Mexico</a>" (1914), "<a href="Are%20You%20a%20Mason%3F%20%281915%20film%29">Are You a Mason?</a>", "<a href="The%20Dictator%20%281915%20film%29">The Dictator</a>" and "<a href="The%20Incorrigible%20Dukane">The Incorrigible Dukane</a>" (all 1915). Except for "The Incorrigible Dukane", all of these early films are presumed <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

Despite the film work and the higher fees he earned from it, Barrymore continued to seek stage work, and in January 1914 he played the lead in "<a href="The%20Yellow%20Ticket">The Yellow Ticket</a>" at New York's <a href="Empire%20Theatre%20%2842nd%20Street%29">Eltinge Theatre</a>. The role marked a departure from the light comedy of his previous performances, a result of Sheldon urging him to turn towards more dramatic parts. "The Yellow Ticket" was not the breakthrough that Barrymore wanted. A few months before the outbreak of World War One, he took a vacation to Italy with Sheldon to enjoy a temporary break from his worsening marriage. He returned from Italy and accepted another serious stage role, that of an ex-convict in "Kick In", at New York's <a href="Longacre%20Theatre">Longacre Theatre</a>. The play was a success, and Barrymore received praise from the critics; "The New York Times" reviewer thought that in a play that had "uncommonly able and sincere playing", Barrymore acted his role with "intelligence and vigor and impart[ed] to it a deal of charm".

Barrymore spent the second half of 1915 making three films, including "<a href="The%20Red%20Widow">The Red Widow</a>", which he called "the worst film I ever made" in his 1926 autobiography. In April 1916, he starred in <a href="John%20Galsworthy">John Galsworthy</a>'s prison drama <a href="Justice%20%28play%29">"Justice"</a>, again at the instigation of Sheldon. The play was a critical success, and "The New York Times" thought the audience saw "Barrymore play as he had never played before, and so, by his work as the wretched prisoner in "Justice", step forward into a new position on the American stage." The critic went on to say that Barrymore gave "an extraordinary performance in every detail of appearance and manner, in every note of deep feeling ... a superb performance."
From early 1916, Barrymore had been living apart from Katherine, and she sued for divorce in November 1916. By the time the divorce was finalized in December 1917, he had taken <a href="A.%20J.%20Raffles%20%28character%29">the lead role</a> in the film "<a href="Raffles%2C%20the%20Amateur%20Cracksman%20%281917%20film%29">Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman</a>". He had also tried to enlist in the U.S. Army following the country's entry into World War I, but Army doctors revealed that he had <a href="varicose%20veins">varicose veins</a>, and he was not accepted for military service. For over a year beginning in April 1917, he appeared together with Lionel in <a href="Peter%20Ibbetson%20%28play%29">a stage version</a> of <a href="George%20du%20Maurier">George du Maurier</a>'s 1891 novel "<a href="Peter%20Ibbetson">Peter Ibbetson</a>". The play and the two Barrymores were warmly regarded by the critics. Around this time, Barrymore began a relationship with a married mother of two, <a href="Blanche%20Oelrichs">Blanche Oelrichs</a>, a <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a> from an elite Rhode Island family with what Peters calls "anarchistic self-confidence". Oelrichs also published poetry under the name Michael Strange. While their relationship began in secret, it became more open after Oelrichs' husband was commissioned into the army and then posted to France.

Both Oelrichs and Sheldon urged Barrymore to take on his next role, Fedya Vasilyevich Protasov, in <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Living%20Corpse">Redemption</a>" at the <a href="Gerald%20Schoenfeld%20Theatre">Plymouth Theatre</a>. The critic for "The New York Times" felt that, although Barrymore's performance was "marred by vocal monotony", overall the performance was "a distinct step forward in Mr. Barrymore's artistic development ... There is probably not another actor on our stage who has a temperament so fine and spiritual, an art so flexible and sure." In 1918, Barrymore starred in the romantic comedy film "<a href="On%20the%20Quiet">On the Quiet</a>"; the "<a href="Iowa%20City%20Press-Citizen">Iowa City Press-Citizen</a>" considered the film superior to the original Broadway performance.
In 1919, Barrymore portrayed a struggling lawyer in the <a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Bride%20%281919%20film%29">film adaptation</a> of the Broadway show "Here Comes the Bride", which he followed with "<a href="The%20Test%20of%20Honor">The Test of Honor</a>". The latter film marked his first straight dramatic role on screen after years of performing in comedy dramas. Later that year, when Barrymore again appeared on stage with Lionel in <a href="Sem%20Benelli">Sem Benelli</a>'s historical drama "The Jest", audience members "agree[d] that the American stage had never witnessed finer acting", according to Peters. <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a>, writing in "The New York Times", thought that "John and Lionel Barrymore hold spellbound each breathless audience", and he commented that Barrymore "contributes to that appeal by every step, every hand, every posture of a body grown unexpectedly eloquent in recent years". In November, Barrymore began filming "<a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281920%20film%29">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>", playing the <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%28character%29">dual leading role</a>, and the film was released in theaters the following year. "<a href="Film%20Daily">Wid's Daily</a>" thought that "it is the star's picture from the very outset, and it is the star that makes it", going on to say that Barrymore's portrayal was "a thing of fine shadows and violent emotions". "The Washington Post" was in agreement, and considered the performance to be "a masterpiece", and "a remarkable piece of work". The film was so successful that the US Navy used stills of Barrymore in its recruiting posters.

After planning for over a year – largely in secret – Barrymore played his first <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> part, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">the title role</a> in "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>". Conscious of the criticism of his vocal range, he underwent training with Margaret Carrington, the voice and diction trainer, to ensure he sounded right for the part, and the pair worked together daily for up to six hours a day for six weeks. After the debut in March 1920, the critics were effusive in their praise. The "<a href="Washington%20Herald">Washington Herald</a>" observed that the audience were "held by the sheer power of Barrymore's performance", which was "remarkable for ... [the actor's] unexpected vocal richness", while Woollcott, in "The New York Times", thought the performance "marked a measurable advance in the gradual process of bringing [Barrymore's] technical fluency abreast with his winged imagination and his real genius for the theatre".
Although a commercial and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in "Redemption" he had worked ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, and by the time he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler <a href="William%20Muldoon">William Muldoon</a>, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, <a href="Diana%20Barrymore">Diana Barrymore</a>, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for "Clair de Lune", which his wife had adapted from <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s 1869 novel "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Laughs">The Man Who Laughs</a>". Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen – it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together in over a decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.

In 1921, Barrymore portrayed a wealthy Frenchman in New York in the film "<a href="The%20Lotus%20Eater%20%28film%29">The Lotus Eater</a>", with <a href="Colleen%20Moore">Colleen Moore</a>. In September, Barrymore and Oelrichs went to Europe on holiday; cracks were appearing in their relationship, and she fell in love with a poet during their extended stay in Venice. In October, Oelrichs returned to New York and Barrymore traveled to London to film the exterior scenes for his latest movie, "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes%20%281922%20film%29">Sherlock Holmes</a>", in which he played the title role. He then returned to New York to work on the film's interior scenes in January 1922. Barrymore became involved in the pre-production work for the film and provided designs for <a href="Professor%20Moriarty">Moriarty's</a> lair. The film was released later that year and was generally thought "a little dull and ponderous, with too many <a href="intertitle">intertitle</a>s", although James W. Dean of "<a href="The%20Patriot-News">The Evening News</a>" of Harrisburg opined that "the personality of Barrymore is the film's transcendent quality".
Barrymore decided next to star in "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" on stage, with <a href="Arthur%20Hopkins">Arthur Hopkins</a> directing. They spent six months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as "a man's man", according to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a "normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him ... he was a great fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", opined that it was "an evening that will be memorable in the history of the American theater". while <a href="John%20Corbin">John Corbin</a>, the drama critic for "The New York Times", agreed, writing that "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for "Brooklyn Life" stated that Barrymore had "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as "not so much princely – he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".

Barrymore and Hopkins decided to end the run at 101 performances, just breaking the record of one hundred by <a href="Edwin%20Booth">Edwin Booth</a>, before the play closed in February 1923. In November and December that year, a three-week run of the play was staged at the <a href="Manhattan%20Center">Manhattan Opera House</a>, followed by a brief tour that closed at the end of January 1924.

News of Barrymore's success in "Hamlet" piqued the interest of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, which signed him as <a href="Beau%20Brummell">the lead</a> in the 1924 film "<a href="Beau%20Brummel%20%281924%20film%29">Beau Brummel</a>". Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore – aged 40 at the time – sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star <a href="Mary%20Astor">Mary Astor</a> during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: "The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that are to be found in almost any normal anthropological specimen, and those are the apples I try to keep on top of the barrel."
In February 1925, Barrymore staged "Hamlet" in London at the Haymarket Theatre, which the "<a href="The%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" later said had "the most memorable first night for years". The reviews were positive, and "although none of the London critics found Barrymore superior to <a href="Henry%20Irving">[Henry] Irving</a> and <a href="Johnston%20Forbes-Robertson">[Johnston] Forbes-Robertson</a>, many were favorable in their comparisons". Among the audience members was the 20-year-old actor <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, who wrote in his program "Barrymore is romantic in appearance and naturally gifted with grace, looks and a capacity to wear period clothes, which makes his brilliantly intellectual performance classical without being unduly severe, and he has tenderness, remoteness, and neurosis all placed with great delicacy and used with immense effectiveness and admirable judgment". Looking back in the 1970s, he said: "The handsome middle-aged stars of the Edwardian theatre romanticised the part. Even John Barrymore, whose Hamlet I admired very much, cut the play outrageously so that he could, for instance, play the closet scene all out for sentiment with the emphasis on the '<a href="Oedipus%20complex">Oedipus complex</a>' – sobbing on Gertrude's bosom. Yet Barrymore ... had a wonderful edge and a demonic sense of humour."

At the end of this run of "Hamlet", Barrymore traveled to Paris, where Oelrichs had stayed during his residence in London, but the reunion was not a happy one and the couple argued frequently. When he returned to America, she remained in Paris, and the couple drew up a separation agreement that provided Oelrichs with $18,000 a year and stated that neither could sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery. While he had been in London, Warner Bros and Barrymore entered into a contact for three further films at a salary of $76,250 per picture. He later claimed that his motivation for moving from stage to films was the "lack of repetition—the continual playing of a part, which is so ruinous to an actor, is entirely eliminated".
Barrymore's first film under the contract was "<a href="The%20Sea%20Beast">The Sea Beast</a>" (1926), loosely based on the 1851 novel "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>", in which he played <a href="Captain%20Ahab%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Captain Ahab Ceeley</a>. This was one of the biggest money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Although Barrymore wanted Astor to play the female lead, she was unavailable, and <a href="Dolores%20Costello">Dolores Costello</a> was cast in her place. He later said that "I fell in love with her instantly. This time I knew I was right", and the couple began an affair. Costello's father was angered by the relationship, but his complaints were ignored by both Costello and her mother: Costello's parents separated and were divorced as a result. The film was well received by critics, and <a href="Mordaunt%20Hall">Mordaunt Hall</a>, the film critic of "The New York Times", praised the "energy, earnestness and virility" Barrymore displayed in the role of Ceeley.

As filming finished on "The Sea Beast", work began on "<a href="Don%20Juan%20%281926%20film%29">Don Juan</a>", the first feature-length film with synchronized <a href="Vitaphone">Vitaphone</a> sound effects and a musical <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a>. Although Barrymore wanted to play opposite Costello again, <a href="Jack%20L.%20Warner">Jack L. Warner</a>, the film's producer, signed Astor. After completing his Warner Bros. contract with "<a href="When%20a%20Man%20Loves">When a Man Loves</a>", with Costello, Barrymore joined <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> (UA) under a three-film deal. For the next three years, according to Morrison, he "enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and spent lavishly". Nevertheless, he received some harsh reviews. Critic and essayist <a href="Stark%20Young">Stark Young</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" that Barrymore's films were "rotten, vulgar, empty, in bad taste, dishonest, noisome with a silly and unwholesome exhibitionism, and odious with a kind of stale and degenerate studio adolescence. Their appeal is cheap, cynical and specious".

In 1927, Barrymore planned to revive "Hamlet" at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>, but in August he canceled the production, without explanation, and began filming the third of the UA pictures, "<a href="Eternal%20Love%20%281929%20film%29">Eternal Love</a>", for which he was paid $150,000. In February 1928, Barrymore obtained a quiet divorce from Oelrichs; she eagerly agreed to the separation, as she was in a relationship with a lawyer, <a href="Harrison%20Tweed">Harrison Tweed</a>, whom she later married. Barrymore and Costello married in November that year; their daughter, Dolores, was born in April 1930 and a son, <a href="John%20Drew%20Barrymore">John Drew Barrymore</a>, followed in June 1932. Barrymore purchased and converted an estate in the Hollywood Hills into 16 different buildings with 55 rooms, gardens, <a href="Skeet%20shooting">skeet ranges</a>, swimming pools, fountains and a totem pole.
By the late 1920s, <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>s had become common, following the 1927 sensation, "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer">The Jazz Singer</a>". Actors with trained voices were in demand by the studios, and Barrymore was offered a five-film deal with Warner Bros. at $150,000 per picture, and a share of the profits. Before he began this contract, he played his first speaking role on film: a one-off section in "<a href="The%20Show%20of%20Shows">The Show of Shows</a>" (1929), playing Richard, Duke of Gloucester in "<a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%203">Henry VI, Part 3</a>". His first two films under contract were "<a href="General%20Crack">General Crack</a>" and "<a href="The%20Man%20from%20Blankley%27s">The Man from Blankley's</a>", each of which were modestly successful. As he had been frustrated at the inability of making "The Sea Beast" as a sound film, Barrymore returned to "Moby Dick" as the source for a 1930 film <a href="Moby%20Dick%20%281930%20film%29">of the same name</a>. Peters thinks little of the film, describing it as "a seesaw between the cosmic and the comic, a travesty of Melville as well as a silly film all on its own".

The following year, Barrymore played the title role of a manipulative voice coach in "<a href="Svengali%20%281931%20film%29">Svengali</a>", opposite <a href="Marian%20Marsh">Marian Marsh</a>. Martin Dickstein, the critic for the "<a href="Brooklyn%20Eagle">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a>", wrote that Barrymore "registers a personal triumph in the role", calling his performance "brilliant ... one of the best of his movie career". Later in 1931, he played a crippled puppeteer, who tries to fulfill his frustrated ambitions by manipulating the life of a young male ballet dancer and the dancer's lover (also Marsh) in "<a href="The%20Mad%20Genius">The Mad Genius</a>"; the film was a commercial failure. With disappointing box office returns from their five-film deal, Warner Bros. decided not to offer Barrymore a contract renewal. Instead, Barrymore signed a non-exclusive contract with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> (MGM) and took a $25,000 salary cut per film.

Barrymore's first film for MGM was the 1932 mystery "<a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Lupin%20%281932%20film%29">Arsène Lupin</a>", in which he co-starred with his brother Lionel. In "The New York Times", Hall called Barrymore's performance "admirable" and wrote that "it is a pleasure to see [him] again in something in a lighter vein." The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> in the 1932 film "<a href="Grand%20Hotel%20%281932%20film%29">Grand Hotel</a>", in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; <a href="John%20Gilbert%20%28actor%29">John Gilbert</a>'s biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming "more like ... [Garbo's] affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of "International Photographer" praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking." "Grand Hotel" won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a> and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>.
In 1932, Barrymore went to <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> where he played a borderline-alcoholic lawyer in "<a href="State%27s%20Attorney%20%28film%29">State's Attorney</a>", and an escaped lunatic in "<a href="A%20Bill%20of%20Divorcement%20%281932%20film%29">A Bill of Divorcement</a>", opposite <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> in her screen debut. Film scholar <a href="Daniel%20Bernardi">Daniel Bernardi</a> later noted the <a href="humanism">humanism</a> demonstrated between Barrymore's character and his family, particularly the "close bond" between father and daughter. In his final film of the year, he returned to MGM for "<a href="Rasputin%20and%20the%20Empress">Rasputin and the Empress</a>", Barrymore, Ethel and Lionel co-starred. Physically, Barrymore had deteriorated since filming "Svengali", and he had gained weight because of his drinking. Peters notes the "dissipation of the once ascetic face, a dissipation only underlined by the studio's attempt to reconstruct with lights, filters and make-up a spiritual beauty that had been corrupted." The film was a critical and commercial failure, and MGM lost significant amounts of money. "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" thought the three Barrymores had produced their worst work.

The year 1933 was a busy one for Barrymore, and his decline began to be evident. He appeared in five films during the year, including as a meek schoolteacher-turned-businessman in "<a href="Topaze%20%281933%20American%20film%29">Topaze</a>", opposite <a href="Myrna%20Loy">Myrna Loy</a>, and "<a href="Dinner%20at%20Eight%20%28film%29">Dinner at Eight</a>", with Lionel. Peters opines that Barrymore's portrayal of a washed-up alcoholic actor "could well have fixed ... in the public's and MGM's mind that John Barrymore was a drunken has-been." After the run of films with MGM, the company ended its contact with Barrymore amid its financial woes caused by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. He then signed with <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> to portray a troubled Jewish lawyer in "<a href="Counsellor%20at%20Law">Counsellor at Law</a>". During filming he struggled to remember his lines for even small scenes. Filming was stopped on one occasion after more than 25 takes when he struggled to recall the right lines; it was a problem with which he began to suffer regularly. Despite the problems, Norden believes that this was "one of his best film performances".
In December 1933, Barrymore agreed with RKO to film "Hamlet". He underwent screen tests and hired Carrington to act as vocal coach again, but during one session, his memory failed him again, and the project was eventually scrapped. Barrymore starred in two films released in 1934, the drama "<a href="Long%20Lost%20Father">Long Lost Father</a>" and the <a href="screwball%20comedy%20film">screwball comedy</a> "<a href="Twentieth%20Century%20%28film%29">Twentieth Century</a>". In the latter film, Barrymore played madcap Broadway impresario Oscar Jaffe, a role in which he demonstrated a "rare genius as a comedian". Morrison writes that the portrayal was one "that many consider to be his finest contribution to film". In 2011, the picture was added to the National Film Registry, where it was described as Barrymore's "last great film role".

In May 1934, Barrymore was filming "<a href="Hat%2C%20Coat%20and%20Glove">Hat, Coat and Glove</a>" for RKO when, during the filming of one scene, he again forgot his lines and even the name of his character. Filming was postponed until the following day, but the result was the same. After he took a break for a few days, he returned to the set, but he still could not remember any of the script, and RKO replaced him with <a href="Ricardo%20Cortez">Ricardo Cortez</a>. Soon afterwards, he suffered a mental and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello confirmed that his drinking over the previous two years had worsened, and she described him as a "hopeless alcoholic". Barrymore's relationship with Costello was deeply troubled and, believing she was going to declare him mentally incompetent, he left their home in Los Angeles and traveled first to London and then to India. He returned to the US in early 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly after his return, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and influenza. A 19-year-old fan, <a href="Elaine%20Barrie">Elaine Jacobs</a>, visited him, and the two became good friends. On his release from the hospital, her mother invited him to recuperate at their house. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she explained was to get "as near to Barrymore as I dared", and they began a relationship. In May, the couple underwent the first of several professional collaborations, when they appeared on <a href="Rudy%20Vall%C3%A9e">Rudy Vallée</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fleischmann%27s%20Yeast%20Hour">The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour</a>" radio show.

The relationship was widely reported in the <a href="Tabloid%20journalism">tabloid press</a>, who labeled the couple <a href="Caliban">Caliban</a> and <a href="Ariel%20%28The%20Tempest%29">Ariel</a>. Costello filed for divorce, but after a series of arguments with Barrie, Barrymore considered the relationship with Barrie to be at an end, and he left for Los Angeles. A newspaper editor chartered a plane and flew Barrie to Chicago, to meet Barrymore's train; she broadcast a plea for him to return, and her pursuit became national news. Morrison thinks that the headlines established a new reputation for Barrymore of "the aging satyr, the has-been alcoholic, the much-married ham". This was a blow to his self-respect, but he faced his troubles "with aplomb and a sense of humor", according to Morrison. To escape from the spotlight, Barrymore took vacations on his yacht; it cost him over $35,000 a year to run, and so he sold it in 1938 after encountering financial difficulties.

Barrymore's alcohol dependence meant most studios were unwilling to employ him, but MGM risked casting him in the role of <a href="Mercutio">Mercutio</a> in their 1936 film "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%281936%20film%29">Romeo and Juliet</a>". To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. <a href="Basil%20Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a>, who was playing <a href="Tybalt">Tybalt</a>, later recounted that "he was drinking and unreliable on the set ... It was sad to see him in such a state." Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the "Hollywood Spectator", thought "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a> that "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot."

Word about Barrymore's problems on and off the set spread around the industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year, when he had a supporting role in the musical film "<a href="Maytime%20%281937%20film%29">Maytime</a>". His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterwards, and he again spent time in Kelley's Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the "Maytime" set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.

Barrymore decided to work on more Shakespeare roles. In June 1937, he signed up with <a href="Blue%20Network">NBC Radio</a> to produce a series of six episodes under the name "Streamlined Shakespeare", which also featured Barrie. The first program was "Hamlet", which was well received by critics. "The New York Times" commented that "Shakespeare's lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the 'ether' with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words and no one else could speak them with such lifelike force". Peters disagrees however, and considers that "because he was desperate he pressed too hard and ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting".
Throughout the NBC series, Barrymore had been reliable, sober and responsible, and the studios reacted positively with offers of work. This led to appearances in nine films in 1937 and 1938, including as Colonel Nielson in three <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">Bulldog Drummond</a> films, and roles in "<a href="True%20Confession">True Confession</a>" and "<a href="Marie%20Antoinette%20%281938%20film%29">Marie Antoinette</a>". He was offered predominantly supporting roles, but he worked conscientiously on the films and as a consequence was able to honor his debts. His memory was still problematic, and he used <a href="cue%20cards">cue cards</a> as an aid; his fellow actors and the directors of the films were sympathetic to his condition. When he filmed his last serious role, Gregory Vance in the 1939 film "<a href="The%20Great%20Man%20Votes">The Great Man Votes</a>", the director, <a href="Garson%20Kanin">Garson Kanin</a>, ensured that the cast and crew addressed him as "Mr. Barrymore" as a mark of respect.
Barrymore and his wife both appeared in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy "<a href="Midnight%20%281939%20film%29">Midnight</a>", her only film role. "The New York Times" thought the film was "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" and that Barrymore, "the <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">[Lou] Gehrig</a> of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore and his wife appeared together in the stage farce "My Dear Children", which opened in March 1939 at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>'s <a href="McCarter%20Theatre">McCarter Theatre</a>. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine wrote that "People flock to see [Barrymore], not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. Usually he forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show." When the show reached Broadway, "Life" wrote that "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a>, writing for "The New York Times" thought that Barrymore was "still the most gifted actor in this country. ... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in "My Dear Children" but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.

In 1940, Barrymore appeared in "<a href="The%20Great%20Profile">The Great Profile</a>", a spoof of his life in the months prior to "My Dear Children". Barrymore played Evans Garrick, closely modeled on his own experience, and <a href="Mary%20Beth%20Hughes">Mary Beth Hughes</a> played his wife. The critics reacted harshly to the film, and to Barrymore's association with it. "The New York Times" wrote that "As a play it is a feeble thing, hardly matching the spectacular public accounts of his amours ... for all of Mr. Barrymore's shenanigans and devastating wit, "The Great Profile" is more than a little pathetic. In the Winter of his Discontent Mr. Barrymore is selling his talent at cut-rate". In terms of his reputation, worse was to come in his final film, "<a href="Playmates%20%281941%20film%29">Playmates</a>" (1941), which "amply illustrated the depths to which he had fallen; he played an alcoholic Shakespearean ham named John Barrymore".

In October 1940, Barrymore returned to the NBC Radio network to work on Rudy Vallée's show, now called the "Sealtest Show". Barrymore recorded 74 episodes of the program, continuing in the vein of self-parody, with jokes about his drinking, declining career and marital issues. On May 19, 1942, while recording a line from "Romeo and Juliet" for the show, Barrymore collapsed. He was taken to the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and died there on May 29, from <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver and kidney failure, complicated by <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Shortly before his death, Barrymore returned to the faith of the Catholic Church. Although <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>'s memoirs claim that the film director <a href="Raoul%20Walsh">Raoul Walsh</a> "borrowed" Barrymore's body before burial to leave his corpse propped in a chair for a drunken Flynn to discover when he returned home, Gene Fowler, a close friend of Barrymore, stayed with the body all night and denies the story. Barrymore was buried at <a href="Calvary%20Cemetery%2C%20East%20Los%20Angeles">Calvary Cemetery</a> in Los Angeles on June 2. In 1980, Barrymore's son had his father's body reinterred at Philadelphia's Mount Vernon Cemetery.

"The New York Times" obituary stated that during the period when Barrymore's performed in "Justice", "Richard III" and "Hamlet", the actor "was accepted by most critics as the foremost English-speaking actor of his time ... equipped both by nature and by art." "The Washington Post" agreed, noting that during his stage triumphs and early years in film, "he was the great profile, the darling of the 'royal family' of the stage." Many of the obituaries made the point that Barrymore fell short of his potential. "The Manchester Guardian" thought that he "might with some self-discipline have added his name to the list of truly great actors ... yet he dissipated his energies". "The New York Times" noted that he could twist his abilities "to parody, burlesque himself and play the clown", and they considered that it was "unfortunate that the public in recent years saw him in ... [that] mood. It was a mood of careless abdication". "The Washington Post" observed that "with the passing of the years – and as his private life became more public – he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character."

According to Morrison, Barrymore's stage portrayals of "Richard III" and "Hamlet" were a model for modern performances of these roles. His interpretation along psychological lines was innovative, and his "dynamic portrayals ... changed the direction of subsequent revivals." Barrymore's natural acting style reversed the stage conventions of the time; his "'colloquial' verse speaking introduced to the stage the vocal manner of a postwar gentleman."
Barrymore was honored on few occasions by the entertainment industry and its members. Although both his brother and sister won <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s, the only award Barrymore ever received for his screen work was from <a href="Rudolph%20Valentino">Rudolph Valentino</a> in 1925 for "Beau Brummel". Valentino created an award in his own name and felt that his fellow actors should receive accolades for their screen work. When Barrymore attended his ceremony at <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a> in 1940, he left more than the customary <a href="List%20of%20TCL%20Chinese%20Theatre%20handprint%20ceremonies">hand and footprints</a> in the theater's forecourt: aided by the owner, <a href="Sid%20Grauman">Sid Grauman</a>, Barrymore left a cement imprint of his facial profile. In February 1960, for his contribution to the motion picture industry, Barrymore was inducted into the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> with a <a href="List%20of%20actors%20with%20Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame%20motion%20picture%20stars">star</a> at 6667 <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>; Barrymore, along with his two siblings, is included in the <a href="American%20Theater%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Theater Hall of Fame</a>. The Barrymore "Royal Family" of actors continued through two of his children – his son with Costello, <a href="John%20Drew%20Barrymore">John Drew Barrymore</a> and his daughter with Oelrichs, <a href="Diana%20Barrymore">Diana</a> – both of whom became actors, as did John Jr.'s daughter <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew</a>. Barrymore's brother Lionel died on November 15, 1954, and their sister Ethel died on June 18, 1959.
Barrymore's achievements and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, "Confessions of an Actor". Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, authorized by the subject, "John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man"; Fowler, wrote "Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life and Times of John Barrymore" (1943); Alpert published "The Barrymores" (1964); and John Kobler wrote "Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore" (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 that many of these earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, "The House of Barrymore", and his own study of the actor's work in "John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography" (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed "John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor" in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.

There were several celebratory events in 1982, on the centenary of Barrymore's birth. The <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> and the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> jointly hosted a commemorative program of his work, which included numerous excerpts from his films and interviews with some who knew him, including Barrie and his one-time co-star Myrna Loy. The same year, in celebration of the centenary of the <a href="Actors%20Fund%20of%20America">Actors Fund of America</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">US Postal Service</a> issued a postage stamp featuring Barrymore and his siblings. In February 2010, an intersection in <a href="Fort%20Lee%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fort Lee, New Jersey</a>, was renamed John Barrymore Way on what would have been the actor's 128th birthday. The intersection marked the spot of the former Buckheister's Hotel, where Barrymore had his 1900 stage debut in "A Man of the World".

Barrymore has been used as the inspiration for characters on stage and film. He performed as himself in a number of works (including "The Great Profile", "My Dear Children" and "Playmates"), and in the "<a href="Ziegfeld%20Follies">Ziegfeld Follies</a>" of 1921 he was played by his friend <a href="W.%20C.%20Fields">W. C. Fields</a>. In 1927 the Barrymore family was parodied in "<a href="The%20Royal%20Family%20%28play%29">The Royal Family</a>" in which a character based on him was portrayed by <a href="Fredric%20March">Fredric March</a>, whose performance Barrymore admired. The play was staged in London in 1934 as "Theatre Royal", with <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> in the Barrymore role, and <a href="The%20Royal%20Family%20of%20Broadway">adapted as a film in 1930</a>, with March reprising his performance.

In 1991, <a href="Paul%20Rudnick">Paul Rudnick</a>'s comedy "<a href="I%20Hate%20Hamlet">I Hate Hamlet</a>", performed at the <a href="Walter%20Kerr%20Theatre">Walter Kerr Theatre</a>, was set in Barrymore's former apartment. He returns after a séance, dressed in his "Hamlet" costume. <a href="Nicol%20Williamson">Nicol Williamson</a> played the Barrymore role. Three years later, a London production, "Jack: A Night on the Town with John Barrymore", ran for 60 performances at the <a href="Criterion%20Theatre">Criterion Theatre</a>, and Williamson again played the lead. "<a href="Barrymore%20%28play%29">Barrymore</a>", a two-person play by <a href="William%20Luce">William Luce</a>, premiered in 1996 and depicts Barrymore shortly before his death in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his Richard III. <a href="Christopher%20Plummer">Christopher Plummer</a> played the title role. A film version was released in 2012, with Plummer again taking the main role.

Barrymore had been a friend and drinking companion of Fields. In the 1976 film "<a href="W.C.%20Fields%20and%20Me">W.C. Fields and Me</a>", Barrymore was played by <a href="Jack%20Cassidy">Jack Cassidy</a>. Barrymore's friend, Errol Flynn, played him in a 1958 film "<a href="Too%20Much%2C%20Too%20Soon">Too Much, Too Soon</a>", an adaptation of the autobiography of Diana Barrymore, with <a href="Dorothy%20Malone">Dorothy Malone</a> playing the female lead. <a href="Howard%20Thompson%20%28film%20critic%29">Howard Thompson</a>, the film critic of "The New York Times", wrote that "Flynn, as the late John Barrymore, a moody, wild-drinking ruin of a great actor, steals the picture, lock, stock and keg. It is only in the scenes of his savage disintegration, as the horrified girl hangs on, that the picture approaches real tragedy."

Bobby Robson

Sir Robert William Robson (18 February 1933 – 31 July 2009) was an English <a href="Association%20football">footballer</a> and football manager. His career included periods playing for and later managing the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a> and being a UEFA Cup-winning manager at <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town F.C.</a>

Robson's professional playing career as an <a href="inside%20forward">inside forward</a> spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, and, briefly, <a href="Vancouver%20Royals">Vancouver Royals</a>. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals. After his playing career, he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the Netherlands and Portugal, earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the <a href="West%20Germany%20v%20England%20%281990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">semi-finals</a> of the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 FIFA World Cup</a>, which remained the national team's best run in a World Cup since <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966</a> until they reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 World Cup</a>. His last management role was as a mentor to the manager of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland national team</a>.

Robson was created a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in 2002, was inducted as a member of the <a href="English%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">English Football Hall of Fame</a> in 2003, and was the honorary president of <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. From 1991 onwards, he suffered recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the <a href="Sir%20Bobby%20Robson%20Foundation">Sir Bobby Robson Foundation</a>, a cancer research charity which has so far collected over £12 million (March 2018). In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, "My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>... I am going to die sooner rather than later. But then everyone has to go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute." He died just under a year later.

Robson was born in <a href="Sacriston">Sacriston</a>, County Durham, the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (née Watt). When he was a few months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of <a href="Langley%20Park%2C%20County%20Durham">Langley Park</a> where his father was a coal miner. Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an <a href="outside%20toilet">outside toilet</a>. As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> play at <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a> on Saturday afternoons, requiring a 34-mile round trip. Robson described <a href="Jackie%20Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a> and <a href="Len%20Shackleton">Len Shackleton</a> as his childhood heroes. Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career.

Robson attended Langley Park primary school and then <a href="Waterhouses%2C%20County%20Durham">Waterhouses</a> <a href="secondary%20modern%20school">secondary modern school</a>, but the headmaster did not allow the school football team to join a league. Instead, he began to play for Langley Park Juniors on Saturday mornings at age 11, and by the time he was 15, he was representing the club at under-18 level. Robson played football whenever he possibly could but left school aged 15 to start work as an electrician's apprentice for the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> in the Langley Park <a href="colliery">colliery</a>. In May 1950, <a href="Bill%20Dodgin%2C%20Sr.">Bill Dodgin</a>, the manager of <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, made a personal visit to the Robson household to offer Bobby a professional contract. Despite being offered a contract by nearby <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, the offer made by Dodgin was too attractive to turn down, so he signed for Fulham and moved to London, playing as a wing half and inside forward. Robson had also interested his beloved Newcastle, but he opted to join Fulham as, in his opinion, "Newcastle made no appreciable effort to secure [my] signature." He also thought he stood a better chance of breaking into the first team at Fulham. Robson suffered from <a href="Hearing%20loss">partial deafness</a> in one ear, which rendered him ineligible to be called up for <a href="national%20service">national service</a>.

Although Robson had signed professionally, his father insisted he continue to work as an electrician. He spent the day working at the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a> site and trained three nights a week at Fulham. Eventually, this took its toll on Robson and he gave up his trade for full-time professional football.

In 1950, Robson made his first-team debut for Fulham, recently promoted to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, in a match against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. He came to regard Fulham as "a nice club, a social club...", but "never... a serious, championship-challenging club". Indeed, he and Fulham were relegated from the top-flight in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1951–52</a> season, but he made his return to the First Division, four years later, when he signed for <a href="Vic%20Buckingham">Vic Buckingham</a>'s <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in March 1956. The transfer fee of £25,000 was a club record for West Brom at the time.

He made his West Brom debut in a 4–0 home defeat to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on 10 March 1956. In <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">1957–58</a>, he was the club's top league goalscorer; his tally of 24 goals included four in a 5–1 win against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. Often playing as a <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a>, he went on to play 257 matches and score 61 goals for West Brom, and he captained the team for the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a> and <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a> seasons. However, in August 1962, he returned to Fulham after a disagreement with West Brom vice-chairman Jim Gaunt over his salary. The ongoing dispute over both minimum and maximum wages in the game, instigated by Robson's teammate <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> and the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a>, combined with the birth of Robson's second son, prompted Robson to demand a higher salary. Gaunt refused to negotiate Robson's contract, so Robson placed a transfer request and was sold to Fulham for £20,000 in a deal which doubled his salary. Soon after Robson joined Fulham, the club sold <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a> and <a href="Rodney%20Marsh">Rodney Marsh</a>, meaning Robson's chances of securing any significant honour there were substantially reduced. Robson himself stated, "In all my time as a footballer, I didn't win a thing."

Despite press reports of interest from <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, and the offer of a <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> role by <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a>, Robson left Fulham in 1967 and accepted a three-year deal with Canada's <a href="Vancouver%20Royals">Vancouver Royals</a>. He was to be player-manager in their inaugural 1968 season in the <a href="North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%281968%E2%80%9384%29">North American Soccer League</a> (NASL) and believed it "was a chance too good to miss". He began scouting and holding tryout camps for the new team in the Fall of 1967. The position proved difficult; a long-distance joint-ownership agreement gave the Hungarian footballer <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a> control over the San Francisco section of the squad, while Robson took care of the Vancouver squad. Robson was dissatisfied by this situation and when, in January 1968, Fulham offered him a contract as their manager, he accepted the position at <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a>.

During his first spell at Fulham, Robson participated in two ambassadorial Football Association tours in the <a href="Caribbean">West Indies</a> in 1955 and South Africa in 1956. However, it was during his time at West Bromwich Albion that he graduated to the full <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> squad, with his first call-up in 1956. His manager, Vic Buckingham, advocated the "<a href="push%20and%20run">push and run</a>" approach to the game, a precursor to "<a href="total%20football">total football</a>", and playing this, Robson graduated to the full England squad in 1956, It was also at West Brom when Robson met future England international and assistant coach <a href="Don%20Howe">Don Howe</a>.

Robson went on to make 20 appearances for the England national team, making his debut in a November 1957 victory against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, scoring twice in a 4–0 victory. Although he made a successful debut, he was dropped for England's next match, against <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a>, in favour of <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>. However, Robson was selected for the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 FIFA World Cup</a> squad, ahead of <a href="Nat%20Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>, but returned from host nation Sweden disappointed after England were defeated by the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a> in a group play-off match.

Following the World Cup, Robson became an established member of the England squad, enjoying considerable success in a period between October 1960 and March 1961 when he played in six England victories, including scoring a goal in the record 9–3 defeat of Scotland at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. He was selected for the <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962 World Cup finals</a> in Chile, but an injury to his ankle sustained in a pre-tournament friendly against a Chilean club side ruled him out of most of the tournament. As Robson recalled, "I never played for England again... my international career was unfulfilled." His place in the England team was taken by <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>.

In 1959, the then <a href="England%20national%20football%20team%20manager">England manager</a> and <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> (FA) director of coaching, <a href="Walter%20Winterbottom">Walter Winterbottom</a>, suggested to Robson that he take a coaching course at <a href="Lilleshall%20Hall">Lilleshall</a>. He obtained coaching qualifications during his second spell at Fulham, and coached <a href="Oxford%20University%20A.F.C.">Oxford University A.F.C.</a>. Robson made his debut as a manager in January 1968 at his former club Fulham, against <a href="Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.">Macclesfield Town</a>, then in the <a href="Cheshire%20County%20League">Cheshire County League</a>, in the third round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Fulham were struggling with 16 points from 24 matches. Despite the acquisition of the young <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a>, Robson could not save the club from relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, and he left them in November with the club sitting eighth in the Second Division. He discovered he had been sacked not from the club itself, but from the headline "Robson sacked" on an "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" placard outside <a href="Putney%20railway%20station">Putney station</a>.

He moved on to Ipswich Town in 1969 and it was there that he established his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman <a href="John%20Cobbold%20%28businessman%29">John Cobbold</a> and then later by his brother <a href="Patrick%20Cobbold">Patrick Cobbold</a>. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a> for <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a>. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the <a href="Texaco%20Cup">Texaco Cup</a> in the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a> season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78</a> season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal in the <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a>. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">1981</a> with a 5–4 <a href="Two-legged%20match">aggregate</a> victory over Dutch side <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">AZ 67 Alkmaar</a>. During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably <a href="Allan%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Allan Hunter</a>, <a href="Bryan%20Hamilton">Bryan Hamilton</a> and <a href="Paul%20Mariner">Paul Mariner</a>, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including <a href="Terry%20Butcher">Terry Butcher</a>, <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a>, <a href="John%20Wark">John Wark</a>, <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a>, <a href="Colin%20Viljoen">Colin Viljoen</a>, <a href="Alan%20Brazil">Alan Brazil</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Whymark">Trevor Whymark</a>, <a href="Brian%20Talbot">Brian Talbot</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Beattie">Kevin Beattie</a> and <a href="Eric%20Gates">Eric Gates</a>, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players <a href="Frans%20Thijssen">Frans Thijssen</a> and <a href="Arnold%20M%C3%BChren">Arnold Mühren</a>. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, with his good interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best.

In 2002, in recognition of his achievements with the club, a life-size statue of Robson was unveiled opposite the Cobbold Stand of Ipswich Town's ground, Portman Road. On 7 July 2006, Robson was named as honorary president of Ipswich Town Football Club, the first since Lady Blanche Cobbold who had died in 1987.

Robson's achievements with Ipswich earned him a job offer from the Football Association for the position of national coach, and he declined an offer of a ten-year contract extension and increased salary from Ipswich director Patrick Cobbold. On 7 July 1982, two days after England were knocked out of the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a>, he succeeded <a href="Ron%20Greenwood">Ron Greenwood</a> as coach of the England national team, selecting former West Bromwich Albion teammate Don Howe as his chief coach.

Robson's first match in charge saw immediate controversy, as he dropped <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> for the match against <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a>. On 21 September 1983, Robson suffered his only loss in the 28 qualifying matches he was to undertake as England manager. The defeat, again to Denmark, ultimately led to England's failure to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201984">1984 European Championships</a> and resulted in Robson offering to resign in favour of <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a>. The resignation was rejected by FA chairman <a href="Bert%20Millichip">Bert Millichip</a> (primarily down to his and the FA's disdain for Clough), and Robson went on to lead the England team to qualify for the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a> in Mexico.

England began the competition poorly and captain <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a> was injured with a recurrence of a dislocated shoulder. Bobby Robson changed the team's tactics for the final match of the first round, selecting <a href="Peter%20Beardsley">Peter Beardsley</a> ahead of <a href="Mark%20Hateley">Mark Hateley</a> as a striking partner for <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>. The team won its next two matches, against <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland</a> and <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a>, 3–0, and qualified for the quarter-finals. England were defeated in the last eight by <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> with a brace of goals from <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>, the infamous <a href="Hand%20of%20God%20goal">"Hand of God" goal</a> and the "<a href="Goal%20of%20the%20Century">Goal of the Century</a>" he scored five minutes later. Robson was unimpressed by Maradona's claim of divine intervention:
Robson's England dropped only one point in qualifying for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988">Euro 1988</a>, which included an 8–0 victory over <a href="Turkey%20national%20football%20team">Turkey</a>. However, this was followed by failure at the tournament itself, held in West Germany, where England were eliminated in the group stage. They finished bottom of their <a href="UEFA%20Euro%2088%23Group%20B">group</a>, succumbing to defeats against the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a>, the eventual winners, the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a>, and the eventual runners-up, the Soviet Union. Robson was vilified by the British press, and after a draw in a friendly with <a href="Saudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team">Saudi Arabia</a>, one newspaper demanded, "In the name of Allah, go." Again Robson submitted his resignation, and again it was rejected by Millichip (again Brian Clough is often cited as a reason).

Robson led England without conceding a goal through <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29%23Group%202">the six-match qualification</a> for the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 World Cup</a> where they were one of six seeded teams. Again they were placed in a group with the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, with <a href="Egypt%20national%20football%20team">Egypt</a> the fourth side. As in the 1986 World Cup, Robson was denied the service of his captain, Bryan Robson, who suffered an <a href="achilles%20tendon">achilles tendon</a> injury which prevented him playing in the latter stages of the tournament. England topped their qualifying group, accumulating four points from their three matches. However, their progress was not without controversy. England changed formation from their traditional 4–4–2 to incorporate a <a href="Sweeper%20%28soccer%29">sweeper</a>, with some sources suggesting this was due to player revolt after the 1–1 draw in the first match with the Republic of Ireland. Robson denied this claim:
This was followed by victories over <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> and <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon</a> in the knock-out stages, to set up a semi-final with <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>. England lost the match on a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>, after the score had been tied at 1–1 following <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>. Robson said afterwards, "[N]ot a day goes by when [he] does not think about the semi-final and other choices [he] might have made." Robson was the second coach, after <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>, to take England to a World Cup semi-final, and the first coach to do so on foreign soil, an achievement not equalled until <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a>'s team reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 World Cup</a>.

Before the 1990 World Cup, the FA told Robson it would not renew his contract as England manager, so he moved on to the Netherlands to coach <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV Eindhoven</a>, succeeding manager <a href="Guus%20Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a>, who had left the team after leading them to the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20European%20Cup">1987–88 European Cup</a> victory and four consecutive <a href="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> titles. PSV sought a manager capable of instilling discipline into a fractious squad, much as Hiddink had done previously. Robson described the move as "a culture shock" but felt "a sense of adventure". News of Robson's new position in the Netherlands became public before the start of the 1990 World Cup, leading to <a href="tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> stories impugning Robson's patriotism; he sued "<a href="Today%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Today</a>" for calling him a traitor.

The Dutch penchant for tactical debate surprised Robson. In an interview with "Voetbal International", he lamented, "An English pro accepts the manager's decision. After every match here, the substitutes come and visit me." Another of his challenges at PSV was handling the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian international</a> <a href="Rom%C3%A1rio">Romário</a>. Robson became frustrated with the Brazilian's work ethic, although admitted "in some matches he would be scintillating". Robson arranged showdown talks with Romário, with <a href="Frank%20Arnesen">Frank Arnesen</a>, Robson's assistant, acting as a translator. The talks proved unsuccessful, with Romário unwilling to change his lifestyle. Despite this, PSV won the Eredivisie in both the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Eredivisie">1990–91</a> and <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Eredivisie">1991–92</a> seasons. However, the team did not make the progress expected by the board in European competitions and Robson was informed he would be leaving the club at the end of the 1991–92 season.

Robson moved to <a href="Sporting%20CP">Sporting CP</a> in July 1992, where his Portuguese <a href="Interpreter%20%28communication%29">interpreter</a> was a young <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>, future <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>, Chelsea, <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> manager. Robson guided the club to a third-place finish in his first season in charge while admitting the club was in "a terrible state". He described the club's president as a "loose cannon" who frequently signed players without Robson's consent. Robson was sacked in December 1993 with the club sitting at the top of the league table. Club president <a href="Sousa%20Cintra">Sousa Cintra</a> cited the club's early exit from the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, at the hands of <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">Casino Salzburg</a>, as the reason for his dismissal.

Sporting CP's rivals Porto quickly hired Robson, with Mourinho appointed as his assistant manager. Living in the same apartment block at the time was another future Porto, Chelsea and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager, the young <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Villas-Boas">André Villas-Boas</a>, who, aged 16, introduced himself to Robson. Robson subsequently appointed Villas-Boas to work in the Porto observation department and helped him gain his UEFA "C" coaching badge in Scotland, despite him technically being ineligible as he was aged 17. Porto were in a poor state when Robson arrived and the average attendance had dwindled to 10,000. The club promptly went on to beat Robson's former club, Sporting CP, in the <a href="Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal">Taça de Portugal</a> final, following that achievement with successive <a href="Primeira%20Liga">League</a> titles in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Primeira%20Divis%C3%A3o">1994–95</a> and <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Primeira%20Divis%C3%A3o">1995–96</a> seasons.

Such was the impact of Robson at Porto, he became known to the locals as "Bobby Five-O" in honour of the number of matches Porto won 5–0, and he signed a new contract with the club in 1995. Suffering from malignant <a href="melanoma">melanoma</a> and missing the first few months of the 1995–96 season, Robson still successfully led Porto in defence of their league title. Such was the success of the team Robson had created, that they managed to claim three more consecutive championships after he had left.

A phone call during the summer of 1996 from <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> vice-president <a href="Joan%20Gaspart">Joan Gaspart</a> to discuss <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a> resulted in an offer of employment with the Spanish club. Robson took over in July 1996, where again his assistant was Mourinho; Robson had made Mourinho's move with him to the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> a condition of his employment. One of the key decisions Robson made during his brief tenure at Barcelona was the US$19.5 million signing of <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a>, who was influential in a season when Barcelona won the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. Robson himself was voted European Manager of the Year for 1996–97, while Ronaldo stated, "as a trainer without doubt [Robson] is one of the greatest in the world".

The 1997–98 season saw Robson moved "upstairs" to the general manager position, with <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> taking over as manager, but Robson stayed in this position for only one season before returning to manage PSV on a short-term deal for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20Dutch%20football">1998–99</a> season. PSV missed out on the league title, finishing third behind <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="Willem%20II%20%28football%20club%29">Willem II</a>, but Robson still led the club to victory in the <a href="Johan%20Cruyff%20Shield">Johan Cruyff Shield</a> and also qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> on the last day of the season.

After Robson's contract expired, he returned to England to take up a position in the Football Association's technical department, but following the resignation of <a href="Ruud%20Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a> at Newcastle United, Robson moved to St James' Park in September 1999. Robson was disappointed with the club's opening salary offer, stating, "[I]t was miles below the going rate," but negotiated a one-year, £1 million deal.

In Robson's first home match in charge, bottom-placed Newcastle faced second bottom Sheffield Wednesday, thrashing them 8–0. In his first season in charge, <a href="1999-2000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a>, Robson led the club to an 11th-place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 matches in charge. In late 2000, following the resignation of ex-"Magpies" boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the FA asked Newcastle club chairman <a href="Freddy%20Shepherd">Freddy Shepherd</a> to permit Robson to take over in a part-time <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker</a> capacity, but the request was refused. Robson guided Newcastle from bottom of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> to a fourth-place finish in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a> season. The following season, Newcastle finished third, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Champions League for the second consecutive year.
However, Robson was unable to guide Newcastle through the Champions League qualifying rounds, and the club was dropped to participate in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> for the 2003–04 season. At the end of the <a href="2003-04%20in%20English%20football">2003–04 season</a>, Newcastle finished fifth in the table, five points short of the Champions League qualifying fourth place but reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup before losing to <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a>.

Robson held the Newcastle post until 30 August 2004, when he was dismissed by Freddy Shepherd, after a poor start to the Premier League season and alleged discontent in the dressing room. Robson's dismissal followed publication of his <a href="Journalism%20sourcing%23%26quot%3BOff%20the%20record%26quot%3B">off the record</a> observation of his disappointment that only 5,000 fans stayed to see the traditional lap of honour made by the players at St James' Park at the end of the previous season. However, he remains held in the highest esteem by the fans; he was granted the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the City</a> of <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> on 2 March 2005.

Robson's autobiography, entitled "Bobby Robson: Farewell but not Goodbye" was released in 2005. The title is based on one of his quotes upon leaving the England job in 1990: "I'm here to say goodbye—maybe not goodbye but farewell." In the book, Robson was critical of Shepherd, claiming that while manager he was denied information regarding the players' contracts and transfer negotiations. He also criticised Shepherd and the club's deputy chairman <a href="Douglas%20Hall%20%28businessman%29">Douglas Hall</a>, for their focus on the first team and St James' Park, causing them to neglect less glamorous issues, such as the training ground, youth development and talent scouts. The club's training ground was later blamed by <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>, Robson's successor, for a series of injuries to first team players.

On 7 June 2005, Robson declined the invitation to become director of football of <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a> because he wanted to stay in the Newcastle area. On 13 January 2006, <a href="Steve%20Staunton">Steve Staunton</a> was appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, with Robson named in a support role as "international football consultant". Robson stepped down from his role of consultant on 17 November 2007 following the nation's final match in their unsuccessful qualifying campaign for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">Euro 2008</a>. Robson was a former vice president of the <a href="League%20Managers%20Association">League Managers Association</a>, a non-executive role.

Robson met Elsie Gray on a trip back to his parents' home in Langley Park. Gray was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married on 25 June 1955 with Fulham teammate <a href="Tom%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201930%29">Tom Wilson</a> as Robson's <a href="best%20man">best man</a>. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and in 2006 was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing the first few months of the 1995–96 season.

On 17 October 2006, it was revealed that Robson had been given the all-clear and was set to see out his contract as consultant to the Irish team. Robson revealed on 7 May 2007 he had been diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time. On 17 May 2008, Robson was the guest of honour at the <a href="2008%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2008 FA Cup Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> when <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> defeated <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> 1–0. He presented the trophy to the victorious captain, <a href="Sol%20Campbell">Sol Campbell</a>.

Robson made a number of product endorsements, including an appearance in <a href="Carlsberg%20Group">Carlsberg</a>'s "Best Pub Side" television commercial. He also acted as a <a href="Pundit%20%28expert%29">pundit</a> for <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> during the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 World Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a>.

Robson defeated <a href="Colorectal%20cancer">bowel cancer</a> in 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a <a href="Tumor">tumour</a> in his right lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially <a href="paralyse">paralyse</a>d due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially <a href="Prosthesis">prosthetic</a> upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as <a href="Terminal%20illness">terminal</a> in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining years of his life to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the <a href="Sir%20Bobby%20Robson%20Foundation">Sir Bobby Robson Foundation</a>. The Foundation raised over £1 million, which funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the <a href="Freeman%20Hospital">Freeman Hospital</a> in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.

In aid of the Foundation, Robson's 1990 World Cup semi-final <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%23Semi-finals">4–3 loss after penalties</a> against West Germany was replayed on 26 July 2009 as the <a href="Sir%20Bobby%20Robson%20Trophy%20match">Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match</a> at St James' Park, featuring players from the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20squads">original 1990 World Cup squads</a> and other special guests. Robson was given a guard of honour before the match, which finished 3–2 to the England side.

At the time of Robson's death, the Foundation had raised £1.6 million. Donations totalling £156,000 were received by the Foundation in the 18 days following his death, and on 15 October 2009, it was announced the Foundation had raised over £2 million, and that at the request of Robson's family, <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a> would take over Robson's role as the Foundation's patron. It passed the £2.5 million mark in September 2010. Three other patrons were added in 2010, <a href="Steve%20Gibson%20%28businessman%29">Steve Gibson</a>, Mick Mills and <a href="Niall%20Quinn">Niall Quinn</a>.

On 31 July 2009, Robson died of lung cancer at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of football and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> called him a "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> president <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> said, "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." Gary Lineker said, "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." Former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> described Robson as a "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, Robson "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster <a href="Michael%20Parkinson">Michael Parkinson</a>, said, "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph."

Robson's funeral, a private family ceremony, took place on 5 August 2009. The location remained undisclosed at the request of his family until the funeral had taken place. It was later revealed to be <a href="Esh%2C%20County%20Durham">Esh, County Durham</a>. A thanksgiving service for Robson was held on 21 September 2009 at <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>. One thousand invited guests attended the service, which was also broadcast live on national television, and to Newcastle United's St James' Park, Ipswich Town's Portman Road ground and Fulham's Craven Cottage.
Robson was survived by his wife and their three sons: Andrew, Paul and Mark.
Robson was awarded a number of honours for his contributions to football. In 1990, at the end of his eight-year reign as England manager, he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> in 1991 and in 2002, he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a>; both awards were for services to football.

In 2002 (during his time as Newcastle manager), the 69-year-old Robson was awarded the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20city">freedom</a> of Newcastle upon Tyne and the UEFA <a href="UEFA%20President%27s%20Award">President's Award</a> for "services to football". He was inducted into the <a href="English%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">English Football Hall of Fame</a> in 2003 in recognition of his impact as a manager. Following his time as Newcastle United manager in 2005, Robson was made an Honorary Freeman of Newcastle, which, in his autobiography, he described as being "the proudest moment of my life". Robson also won the 1992 Football Writers' Association Tribute Award for an outstanding contribution to the national game, and the 2001 British Sports Writers' Association Pat Besford Trophy for Outstanding Achievement. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Sports Coach UK Awards, and was also awarded the Eircom International Personality of the Year in 2006. On 9 December 2007, Robson was awarded the <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year">Sports Personality of the Year</a> show in recognition of "his contribution as both player and manager in a career spanning more than half a century".

On 5 May 2008, during the 30th anniversary celebrations of Ipswich Town's 1978 FA Cup win, Robson was granted the Freedom of <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a> by the Lady Mayor. On 8 December 2008, he earned another such accolade when he was given the Freedom of the <a href="Durham%2C%20England">City of Durham</a>. In March 2009, UEFA awarded Robson the Emerald UEFA Order of Merit award, awarded to "individuals who have dedicated their talents to the good of the game". The award was presented to Robson at St James' Park on 26 July 2009, prior to the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, and just five days before his death.

In December 2009, Robson was posthumously awarded the <a href="FIFA%20Fair%20Play%20Award">FIFA Fair Play Award</a>, for the "gentlemanly qualities he showed throughout his career as a player and coach". All English football league matches held a <a href="one%20minute%27s%20applause">one minute's applause</a> in his memory at the beginning of the 2009–10 season.

<a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> gave Newcastle United and Ipswich Town special dispensation to wear special commemorative kits for their <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> match on 26 September 2009 at Portman Road, in aid of Sir Bobby's Foundation. At half-time during this match, the North Stand of Portman Road was renamed the Sir Bobby Robson Stand.

The first anniversary of Robson's death on 31 July 2010 was marked with a ceremony and pre-season <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> at Newcastle's St James' Park, between two of his former clubs Newcastle United and PSV Eindhoven, involving Robson's PSV captain <a href="Stan%20Valckx">Stan Valckx</a> presenting a PSV shirt to the club.

In July 2010, plans were unveiled for a memorial garden to Robson to be built in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne%20City%20Centre%23Gallowgate">Gallowgate</a> street close to the Newcastle United stadium St James' Park. Work began on the site in November 2010, which was completed by Spring 2011. The garden covers 400 square meters, and features a tiered seating area and sculpted stone plinths reflecting aspects of his life and work. The area also hosts 400 square metre memorial garden to Sir Bobby Robson.

With a keen interest in cricket as well as football, Robson was to have replaced <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a> as president of the <a href="Lord%27s%20Taverners">Lord's Taverners</a> charity and cricket club in 2007, but this was prevented by his ill-health. After his death, the club held a dinner in his honour, as "The best President we never had".

In March 2011, the <a href="East%20Coast%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">East Coast train operating company</a> <a href="nameplate">named</a> one of its <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2091">Class 91</a> electric locomotives "Sir Bobby Robson", unveiled at <a href="Newcastle%20railway%20station">Newcastle station</a> by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer. Similarly, in December 2011, the <a href="Port%20of%20Tyne">Port of Tyne</a> Authority named its new work boat the "Sir Bobby Robson". On 6 May 2012, a statue of Robson created by sculptor <a href="Tom%20Maley%20%28sculptor%29">Tom Maley</a> was unveiled at St James' Park before a 2–0 defeat to eventual champions Manchester City. On 16 July 2013, marking the 150th anniversary celebrations of the FA, the FA designated 10 August as the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, celebrated as a day to celebrate the national game. In 2018, "‎Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager", a feature-length British film about Robson's career and cancer diagnosis, was released to critical acclaim.

Norman conquest of England

The Norman Conquest of England (in Britain, often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of <a href="England">England</a> by an army of <a href="Normans">Norman</a>, <a href="Bretons">Breton</a>, Flemish, and French soldiers led by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, later styled <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>.

William's claim to the <a href="English%20throne">English throne</a> derived from his familial relationship with the childless <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> king <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>. The <a href="Norwegian%20king">Norwegian king</a> <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fulford">Battle of Fulford</a>, but Godwinson's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a> on 25 September. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to oppose him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement.

Although William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20peerage%23Feudal%20origins">English elite</a> were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built <a href="castle">castle</a>s commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the <a href="Noble%20court">court</a> and government, the introduction of the <a href="Norman%20language">Norman language</a> as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William <a href="enfeoffed">enfeoffed</a> lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%23Before%201066">slavery</a>, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.

In 911 the <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingian French</a> ruler <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a> allowed a group of <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> under their leader <a href="Rollo">Rollo</a> to settle in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a> as part of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Clair-sur-Epte">Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte</a>. In exchange for the land, the Norsemen under Rollo were expected to provide protection along the coast against further Viking invaders. Their settlement proved successful, and the Vikings in the region became known as the "Northmen" from which "Normandy" and "Normans" are derived. The Normans quickly adopted the indigenous culture as they became assimilated by the French, renouncing <a href="paganism">paganism</a> and converting to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. They adopted the <a href="langues%20d%27o%C3%AFl">langue d'oïl</a> of their new home and added features from their own <a href="Old%20Norse">Norse language</a>, transforming it into the <a href="Norman%20language">Norman language</a>. They intermarried with the local population and used the territory granted to them as a base to extend the frontiers of the duchy westward, annexing territory including the <a href="Bessin">Bessin</a>, the <a href="Cotentin%20Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a> and <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a>.

In 1002 English king <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a> married <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Emma of Normandy</a>, the sister of <a href="Richard%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Richard II, Duke of Normandy</a>. Their son <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin, Earl of Wessex</a> and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.

When King Edward died at the beginning of 1066, the lack of a clear heir led to a disputed succession in which several contenders laid claim to the throne of England. Edward's immediate successor was the <a href="Earl%20of%20Wessex">Earl of Wessex</a>, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats. Harold was elected king by the <a href="Witenagemot">Witenagemot</a> of England and crowned by the <a href="Ealdred%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">Archbishop of York, Ealdred</a>, although Norman propaganda claimed the ceremony was performed by <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the <a href="canon%20law">uncanonically</a> elected <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Harold was immediately challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this; King Harald III of Norway, commonly known as Harald Hardrada, also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor, <a href="Magnus%20the%20Good">Magnus the Good</a>, and the earlier English king, <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a>, whereby if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald at once set about assembling troops and ships to invade England.

In early 1066, Harold's exiled brother, <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig Godwinson</a>, raided southeastern England with a fleet he had recruited in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, later joined by other ships from <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, but he was driven back to his ships by the brothers <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin, Earl of Mercia</a>, and <a href="Morcar%20of%20Northumbria">Morcar, Earl of Northumbria</a>. Deserted by most of his followers, Tostig withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the summer recruiting fresh forces. King Harold spent the summer on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade, but the bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed them.

King Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Harald's army was further augmented by the forces of Tostig, who threw his support behind the Norwegian king's bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians defeated a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fulford">Battle of Fulford</a>. The two earls had rushed to engage the Norwegian forces before King Harold could arrive from the south. Although Harold Godwinson had married Edwin and Morcar's sister <a href="Ealdgyth%2C%20daughter%20of%20Earl%20%C3%86lfgar">Ealdgyth</a>, the two earls may have distrusted Harold and feared that the king would replace Morcar with Tostig. The end result was that their forces were devastated and unable to participate in the rest of the campaigns of 1066, although the two earls survived the battle.

Hardrada moved on to York, which surrendered to him. After taking hostages from the leading men of the city, on 24 September the Norwegians moved east to the tiny village of <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%2C%20East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">Stamford Bridge</a>. King Harold probably learned of the Norwegian invasion in mid-September and rushed north, gathering forces as he went. The royal forces probably took nine days to cover the distance from London to York, averaging almost per day. At dawn on 25 September Harold's forces reached York, where he learned the location of the Norwegians. The English then marched on the invaders and took them by surprise, defeating them in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a>. Harald of Norway and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such horrific losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory was costly, however, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state, and far from the English Channel.

William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and all over France, including large contingents from <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and Flanders. He mustered his forces at <a href="Saint-Valery-sur-Somme">Saint-Valery-sur-Somme</a> and was ready to cross the Channel by about 12 August. The exact numbers and composition of William's force are unknown. A contemporary document claims that William had 726 ships, but this may be an inflated figure. Figures given by contemporary writers are highly exaggerated, varying from 14,000 to 150,000 men. Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of William's forces: 7000–8000 men, 1000–2000 of them cavalry; 10,000–12,000 men; 10,000 men, 3000 of them cavalry; or 7500 men. The army would have consisted of a mix of cavalry, infantry, and archers or crossbowmen, with about equal numbers of cavalry and archers and the foot soldiers equal in number to the other two types combined. Although later lists of <a href="companions%20of%20William%20the%20Conqueror">companions of William the Conqueror</a> are extant, most are padded with extra names; only about 35 individuals can be reliably claimed to have been with William at Hastings.

<a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a> states that William obtained Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Alexander II</a>'s consent for the invasion, signified by a papal banner, along with diplomatic support from other European rulers. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support before the invasion. William's army assembled during the summer while an invasion fleet in Normandy was constructed. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.

The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge on 25 September, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force. They landed at <a href="Pevensey">Pevensey</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> on 28 September and erected a wooden castle at <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, from which they raided the surrounding area. This ensured supplies for the army, and as Harold and his family held many of the lands in the area, it weakened William's opponent and made him more likely to attack to put an end to the raiding.

Harold, after defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, left much of his force there, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London for about a week before reaching Hastings, so it is likely that he took a second week to march south, averaging about per day, for the nearly to London. Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle remain obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken up a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day <a href="Battle%2C%20East%20Sussex">Battle, East Sussex</a>), about from William's castle at Hastings.

Contemporary sources do not give reliable data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2 million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree on a range of between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the "<a href="fyrd">fyrd</a>" (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the "<a href="housecarls">housecarls</a>", or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the "housecarls" used better protecting armour than that of the "fyrd". The English army does not appear to have had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers <a href="Gyrth">Gyrth</a> and <a href="Leofwine%20Godwinson">Leofwine</a>. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.

The battle began at about 9 am on 14 October 1066 and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although the numbers on each side were probably about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few archers. The English soldiers formed up as a <a href="shield%20wall">shield wall</a> along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. Norman cavalry then attacked and killed the pursuing troops. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans made <a href="Withdrawal%20%28military%29%23Feigned%20retreat">feigned withdrawals</a>, tempting the English into pursuit, and allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which different stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The <a href="Bayeux%20Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head. Other sources stated that no one knew how Harold died because the press of battle was so tight around the king that the soldiers could not see who struck the fatal blow. William of Poitiers gives no details at all about Harold's death.

The day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. The bodies of the English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his "housecarls", were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. <a href="Gytha%20Thorkelsd%C3%B3ttir">Gytha</a>, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff. <a href="Waltham%20Abbey%20%28abbey%29">Waltham Abbey</a>, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been buried there secretly. Later legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.

After his victory at Hastings, William expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a> was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of <a href="Kent">Kent</a> to London. He defeated an English force that <a href="Burning%20of%20Southwark">attacked him at Southwark</a>, but being unable to storm <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a> he sought to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.

William moved up the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> valley to cross the river at <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a>, Berkshire; while there he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the <a href="Chilterns">Chilterns</a>, before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. Having failed to muster an effective military response, Edgar's leading supporters lost their nerve, and the English leaders surrendered to William at <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a>, Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The new king attempted to conciliate the remaining English nobility by confirming Morcar, Edwin and <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof, the Earl of Northumbria</a>, in their lands as well as giving some land to Edgar the Ætheling. William remained in England until March 1067, when he returned to Normandy with English prisoners, including Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar the Ætheling, and Waltheof.

Despite the submission of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. William left control of England in the hands of his half-brother <a href="Bishop%20Odo">Odo</a> and one of his closest supporters, <a href="William%20fitzOsbern">William fitzOsbern</a>. In 1067 rebels in Kent launched an unsuccessful attack on Dover Castle in combination with <a href="Eustace%20II%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace II of Boulogne</a>. The <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> landowner <a href="Eadric%20the%20Wild">Eadric the Wild</a>, in alliance with the Welsh rulers of <a href="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a> and <a href="Powys">Powys</a>, raised a revolt in western <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, fighting Norman forces based in <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>. These events forced William to return to England at the end of 1067. In 1068 William <a href="Siege%20of%20Exeter%20%281068%29">besieged rebels in Exeter</a>, including Harold's mother Gytha, and after suffering heavy losses managed to negotiate the town's surrender. In May, William's wife <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda</a> was crowned queen at Westminster, an important symbol of William's growing international stature. Later in the year Edwin and Morcar raised a revolt in Mercia with Welsh assistance, while <a href="Gospatric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Gospatric</a>, the newly appointed Earl of Northumbria, led a rising in Northumbria, which had not yet been occupied by the Normans. These rebellions rapidly collapsed as William moved against them, building castles and installing garrisons as he had already done in the south. Edwin and Morcar again submitted, while Gospatric fled to Scotland, as did Edgar the Ætheling and his family, who may have been involved in these revolts. Meanwhile, Harold's sons, who had taken refuge in Ireland, raided <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, Devon and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> from the sea.

Early in 1069 the newly installed Norman Earl of Northumbria, <a href="Robert%20de%20Comines">Robert de Comines</a>, and several hundred soldiers accompanying him were massacred at Durham; the Northumbrian rebellion was joined by Edgar, Gospatric, <a href="Siward%20Barn">Siward Barn</a> and other rebels who had taken refuge in Scotland. The castellan of York, Robert fitzRichard, was defeated and killed, and the rebels besieged the Norman castle at York. William hurried north with an army, defeated the rebels outside York and pursued them into the city, massacring the inhabitants and bringing the revolt to an end. He built a second castle at York, strengthened Norman forces in Northumbria and then returned south. A subsequent local uprising was crushed by the garrison of York. Harold's sons launched a second raid from Ireland and were defeated in Devon by Norman forces under Count <a href="Brian%20of%20Brittany">Brian</a>, a son of <a href="Eudes%2C%20Count%20of%20Penthi%C3%A8vre">Eudes, Count of Penthièvre</a>. In August or September 1069 a large fleet sent by <a href="Sweyn%20II%20of%20Denmark">Sweyn II of Denmark</a> arrived off the coast of England, sparking a new wave of rebellions across the country. After abortive raids in the south, the Danes joined forces with a new Northumbrian uprising, which was also joined by Edgar, Gospatric and the other exiles from Scotland as well as Waltheof. The combined Danish and English forces defeated the Norman garrison at York, seized the castles and took control of Northumbria, although a raid into Lincolnshire led by Edgar was defeated by the Norman garrison of <a href="Lincoln%2C%20England">Lincoln</a>.

At the same time resistance flared up again in western Mercia, where the forces of Eadric the Wild, together with his Welsh allies and further rebel forces from <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and Shropshire, attacked the castle at <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>. In the south-west, rebels from Devon and Cornwall attacked the Norman garrison at Exeter but were repulsed by the defenders and scattered by a Norman relief force under Count Brian. Other rebels from <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, Somerset and neighbouring areas besieged <a href="Montacute%20Castle">Montacute Castle</a> but were defeated by a Norman army gathered from London, <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> and <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> under <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Montbray">Geoffrey of Coutances</a>. Meanwhile, William attacked the Danes, who had moored for the winter south of the Humber in Lincolnshire, and drove them back to the north bank. Leaving <a href="Robert%20of%20Mortain">Robert of Mortain</a> in charge of Lincolnshire, he turned west and defeated the Mercian rebels in battle at <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a>. When the Danes attempted to return to Lincolnshire, the Norman forces there again drove them back across the Humber. William advanced into Northumbria, defeating an attempt to block his crossing of the swollen <a href="River%20Aire">River Aire</a> at <a href="Pontefract">Pontefract</a>. The Danes fled at his approach, and he occupied York. He bought off the Danes, who agreed to leave England in the spring, and during the winter of 1069–70 his forces systematically devastated Northumbria in the <a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a>, subduing all resistance. As a symbol of his renewed authority over the north, William ceremonially wore his crown at York on Christmas Day 1069.

In early 1070, having secured the submission of Waltheof and Gospatric, and driven Edgar and his remaining supporters back to Scotland, William returned to Mercia, where he based himself at Chester and crushed all remaining resistance in the area before returning to the south. <a href="Papal%20legate">Papal legate</a>s arrived and at Easter re-crowned William, which would have symbolically reasserted his right to the kingdom. William also oversaw a purge of prelates from the Church, most notably Stigand, who was deposed from Canterbury. The papal legates also imposed <a href="penance">penance</a>s on William and those of his supporters who had taken part in Hastings and the subsequent campaigns. As well as Canterbury, the <a href="see%20of%20York">see of York</a> had become vacant following the death of Ealdred in September 1069. Both sees were filled by men loyal to William: <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, abbot of William's foundation at <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint-%C3%89tienne%2C%20Caen">Caen</a>, received Canterbury while <a href="Thomas%20of%20Bayeux">Thomas of Bayeux</a>, one of William's chaplains, was installed at York. Some other bishoprics and abbeys also received new bishops and abbots and William confiscated some of the wealth of the English monasteries, which had served as repositories for the assets of the native nobles.

In 1070 Sweyn II of Denmark arrived to take personal command of his fleet and renounced the earlier agreement to withdraw, sending troops into <a href="the%20Fens">the Fens</a> to join forces with English rebels led by <a href="Hereward%20the%20Wake">Hereward the Wake</a>, at that time based on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Isle of Ely</a>. Sweyn soon accepted a further payment of <a href="Danegeld">Danegeld</a> from William, and returned home. After the departure of the Danes the Fenland rebels remained at large, protected by the marshes, and early in 1071 there was a final outbreak of rebel activity in the area. Edwin and Morcar again turned against William, and although Edwin was quickly betrayed and killed, Morcar reached <a href="Ely%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Ely</a>, where he and Hereward were joined by exiled rebels who had sailed from Scotland. William arrived with an army and a fleet to finish off this last pocket of resistance. After some costly failures the Normans managed to construct a pontoon to reach the Isle of Ely, defeated the rebels at the bridgehead and stormed the island, marking the effective end of English resistance. Morcar was imprisoned for the rest of his life; Hereward was pardoned and had his lands returned to him.

William faced difficulties in his continental possessions in 1071, but in 1072 he returned to England and marched north to confront King <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm III of Scotland</a>. This campaign, which included a land army supported by a fleet, resulted in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Abernethy">Treaty of Abernethy</a> in which Malcolm expelled Edgar the Ætheling from Scotland and agreed to some degree of subordination to William. The exact status of this subordination was unclear – the treaty merely stated that Malcolm became William's man. Whether this meant only for Cumbria and Lothian or for the whole Scottish kingdom was left ambiguous.

In 1075, during William's absence, <a href="Ralph%20de%20Gael">Ralph de Gael</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Earl of Norfolk</a>, and <a href="Roger%20de%20Breteuil%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Roger de Breteuil</a> the <a href="Earl%20of%20Hereford">Earl of Hereford</a>, conspired to overthrow him in the <a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Earls">Revolt of the Earls</a>. The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger's, held at <a href="Exning">Exning</a>. Another earl, Waltheof, despite being one of William's favourites, was also involved, and some Breton lords were ready to offer support. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by <a href="Wulfstan%20%28died%201095%29">Wulfstan</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, and <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a>, the <a href="Abbot%20of%20Evesham">Abbot of Evesham</a>. Ralph was bottled up in <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a> by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey of Coutances, <a href="Richard%20fitz%20Gilbert">Richard fitzGilbert</a>, and <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William de Warenne</a>. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, and Ralph went into exile. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, <a href="Canute%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Cnut</a>, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home. William did not return to England until later in 1075, to deal with the Danish threat and the aftermath of the rebellion, celebrating Christmas at Winchester. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. By that time William had returned to the continent, where Ralph was continuing the rebellion from Brittany.

Once England had been conquered, the Normans faced many challenges in maintaining control. They were few in number compared to the native English population; including those from other parts of France, historians estimate the number of Norman landholders at around 8000. William's followers expected and received lands and titles in return for their service in the invasion, but William claimed ultimate possession of the land in England over which his armies had given him "de facto" control, and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Henceforth, all land was "held" directly from the king in <a href="Feudal%20land%20tenure">feudal tenure</a> in return for military service. A Norman lord typically had properties located in a piecemeal fashion throughout England and Normandy, and not in a single geographic block.

To find the lands to compensate his Norman followers, William initially confiscated the estates of all the English lords who had fought and died with Harold and redistributed part of their lands. These confiscations led to revolts, which resulted in more confiscations, a cycle that continued for five years after the Battle of Hastings. To put down and prevent further rebellions the Normans constructed castles and fortifications in unprecedented numbers, initially mostly on the <a href="motte-and-bailey">motte-and-bailey</a> pattern. Historian Robert Liddiard remarks that "to glance at the urban landscape of Norwich, Durham or Lincoln is to be forcibly reminded of the impact of the Norman invasion". William and his barons also exercised tighter control over inheritance of property by widows and daughters, often forcing marriages to Normans.

A measure of William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Normandy%20%281202%E2%80%931204%29">Capetian conquest</a> of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely absentee rulers. For example, after 1072, William spent more than 75 per cent of his time in France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.

A direct consequence of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy and the loss of English control over the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the <a href="River%20Tees">Tees</a> was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.

Natives were also removed from high governmental and ecclesiastical office. After 1075 all earldoms were held by Normans, and Englishmen were only occasionally appointed as sheriffs. Likewise in the Church, senior English office-holders were either expelled from their positions or kept in place for their lifetimes and replaced by foreigners when they died. By 1096 no bishopric was held by any Englishman, and English abbots became uncommon, especially in the larger monasteries.

Following the conquest, many Anglo-Saxons, including groups of nobles, fled the country for Scotland, Ireland, or Scandinavia. Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England. The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, when a group of Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The English became the predominant element in the elite <a href="Varangian%20Guard">Varangian Guard</a>, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn. Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast, and established towns with names such as New London and New York.

Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon governmental systems were more sophisticated than their counterparts in Normandy. All of England was divided into administrative units called <a href="shire">shire</a>s, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and a justice system based on local and regional tribunals existed to secure the rights of free men. Shires were run by officials known as shire <a href="reeve%20%28England%29">reeves</a> or <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>s. Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment; England had a permanent treasury at <a href="Winchester%2C%20Hampshire">Winchester</a> before William's conquest. One major reason for the strength of the English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the English system of taxation that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly. The English kings had also developed the system of issuing <a href="writ">writ</a>s to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing <a href="charter">charter</a>s. Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.

This sophisticated medieval form of government was handed over to the Normans and was the foundation of further developments. They kept the framework of government but made changes in the personnel, although at first the new king attempted to keep some natives in office. By the end of William's reign most of the officials of government and the royal household were Normans. The language of official documents also changed, from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> to Latin. The forest laws were introduced, leading to the setting aside of large sections of England as <a href="royal%20forest">royal forest</a>. The Domesday survey was an administrative catalogue of the landholdings of the kingdom, and was unique to medieval Europe. It was divided into sections based on the shires, and listed all the landholdings of each <a href="tenant-in-chief">tenant-in-chief</a> of the king as well as who had held the land before the conquest.

One of the most obvious effects of the conquest was the introduction of <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-Norman</a>, a northern <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>-influenced dialect of <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a>, as the language of the ruling classes in England, displacing Old English. <a href="Norman%20French">Norman French</a> words entered the English language, and a further sign of the shift was the usage of names common in France instead of <a href="Germanic%20name">Anglo-Saxon names</a>. Male names such as <a href="William%20%28name%29">William</a>, <a href="Robert">Robert</a> and <a href="Richard">Richard</a> soon became common; female names changed more slowly. The Norman invasion had little impact on <a href="placenames">placenames</a>, which had changed significantly after earlier <a href="Norse%20activity%20in%20the%20British%20Isles">Scandinavian invasions</a>. It is not known precisely how much English the Norman invaders learned, nor how much the knowledge of Norman French spread among the lower classes, but the demands of trade and basic communication probably meant that at least some of the Normans and native English were bilingual. Nevertheless, <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> never developed a working knowledge of English and for centuries afterwards English was not well understood by the nobility.

An estimated 8000 Normans and other continentals settled in England as a result of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between the native English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, <a href="Ailred%20of%20Rievaulx">Ailred of Rievaulx</a> was writing that intermarriage was common in all levels of society.

The impact of the conquest on the lower levels of English society is difficult to assess. The major change was the elimination of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20British%20Isles">slavery in England</a>, which had disappeared by the middle of the 12th century. There were about 28,000 slaves listed in "Domesday Book" in 1086, fewer than had been enumerated for 1066. In some places, such as Essex, the decline in slaves was 20 per cent for the 20 years. The main reasons for the decline in slaveholding appear to have been the disapproval of the Church and the cost of supporting slaves, who unlike <a href="serf">serf</a>s, had to be maintained entirely by their owners. The practice of slavery was not outlawed, and the "<a href="Leges%20Henrici%20Primi">Leges Henrici Primi</a>" from the reign of King Henry I continue to mention slaveholding as legal.

Many of the free peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the invasion and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by the coming of the Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued to have the ability to dispose of their property as they wished.

Debate over the conquest started almost immediately. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", when discussing the death of William the Conqueror, denounced him and the conquest in verse, but the king's obituary notice from William of Poitiers, a Frenchman, was full of praise. Historians since then have argued over the facts of the matter and how to interpret them, with little agreement. The theory or myth of the "<a href="Norman%20yoke">Norman yoke</a>" arose in the 17th century, the idea that Anglo-Saxon society had been freer and more equal than the society that emerged after the conquest. This theory owes more to the period in which it was developed than to historical facts, but it continues to be used to the present day in both political and popular thought.

In the 20th and 21st centuries historians have focused less on the rightness or wrongness of the conquest itself, instead concentrating on the effects of the invasion. Some, such as <a href="Richard%20Southern">Richard Southern</a>, have seen the conquest as a critical turning point in history. Southern stated that "no country in Europe, between the rise of the barbarian kingdoms and the 20th century, has undergone so radical a change in so short a time as England experienced after 1066". Other historians, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, believe that the transformation was less radical. In more general terms, Singman has called the conquest "the last echo of the national migrations that characterized the early Middle Ages". The debate over the impact of the conquest depends on how change after 1066 is measured. If <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a> was already evolving before the invasion, with the introduction of <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a>, castles or other changes in society, then the conquest, while important, did not represent radical reform. But the change was dramatic if measured by the elimination of the English nobility or the loss of Old English as a literary language. Nationalistic arguments have been made on both sides of the debate, with the Normans cast as either the persecutors of the English or the rescuers of the country from a decadent Anglo-Saxon nobility.

Mutiny on the Bounty

The <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> vessel occurred in the south Pacific on 28 April 1789. Disaffected crewmen, led by Acting Lieutenant <a href="Fletcher%20Christian">Fletcher Christian</a>, seized control of the ship from their captain Lieutenant <a href="William%20Bligh">William Bligh</a> and set him and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's open <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">launch</a>. The mutineers variously settled on <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> or on <a href="Pitcairn%20Island">Pitcairn Island</a>. Bligh meanwhile completed a voyage of more than in the launch to reach safety, and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice.

"Bounty" had left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport <a href="breadfruit">breadfruit</a> plants from Tahiti to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>ns, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.

After Bligh reached England in April 1790, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> despatched <a href="HMS%20Pandora%20%281779%29">HMS "Pandora"</a> to apprehend the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board "Pandora", which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island. After turning back towards England, "Pandora" ran aground on the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, with the loss of 31 crew and four prisoners from "Bounty". The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a>led; four were acquitted, three were pardoned and three were hanged.

Christian's group remained undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808, by which time only one mutineer, <a href="John%20Adams%20%28mutineer%29">John Adams</a>, remained alive. Almost all his fellow-mutineers, including Christian, had been killed, either by each other or by their Polynesian companions. No action was taken against Adams; descendants of the mutineers and their Tahitian captives live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The generally accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, as depicted in well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh has emerged.

<a href="HMS%20Bounty">His Majesty's Armed Vessel (HMAV) "Bounty"</a>, or HMS "Bounty", was built in 1784 at the <a href="Blaydes%20Family">Blaydes</a> shipyard in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> as a <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> named "Bethia". She was renamed after being purchased by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>1,950 in May 1787. She was three-masted, long overall and across at her widest point, and registered at <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">230 tons burthen</a>. Her armament was four short four-pounder <a href="Gun%20carriage">carriage guns</a> and ten half-pounder <a href="swivel%20gun">swivel gun</a>s, supplemented by small arms such as <a href="musket">musket</a>s. As she was rated by the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> as a <a href="Naval%20cutter">cutter</a>, the smallest category of warship, her commander would be a <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a> rather than a <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">post-captain</a> and would be the only <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned officer</a> on board. Nor did a cutter warrant the usual detachment of <a href="Royal%20Marines">Marines</a> that naval commanders could use to enforce their authority.

"Bounty" had been acquired to transport <a href="breadfruit">breadfruit</a> plants from <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> (then rendered "Otaheite"), a <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>n island in the south Pacific, to the British colonies in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. The expedition was promoted by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> and organised by its president <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a>, who shared the view of Caribbean plantation owners that breadfruit might grow well there and provide cheap food for the slaves. "Bounty" was refitted under Banks' supervision at <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Deptford Dockyard</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. The <a href="Cabin%20%28ship%29">great cabin</a>, normally the ship's captain's quarters, was converted into a greenhouse for over a thousand potted breadfruit plants, with glazed windows, skylights, and a lead-covered deck and drainage system to prevent the waste of fresh water. The space required for these arrangements in the small ship meant that the crew and officers would endure severe overcrowding for the duration of the long voyage.

With Banks' agreement, command of the expedition was given to Lieutenant <a href="William%20Bligh">William Bligh</a>, whose experiences included Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="Third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">third and final voyage</a> (1776–80) in which he had served as <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">sailing master</a>, or chief navigator, on <a href="HMS%20Resolution%20%281771%29">HMS "Resolution"</a>. Bligh was born in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> in 1754 into a family of naval and military tradition—Admiral <a href="Richard%20Rodney%20Bligh">Sir Richard Rodney Bligh</a> was his third cousin. Appointment to Cook's ship at the age of 21 had been a considerable honour, although Bligh believed that his contribution was not properly acknowledged in the expedition's official account. With the 1783 ending of the eight-year <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a> and subsequent renewal of conflict with France—which had recognised and allied with the new United States in 1778—the vast Royal Navy was reduced in size, and Bligh found himself ashore on half-pay.

After a period of idleness, Bligh took temporary employment in the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">mercantile service</a> and in 1785 was captain of the "Britannia", a vessel owned by his wife's uncle Duncan Campbell. Bligh assumed the prestigious "Bounty" appointment on 16 August 1787, at a considerable financial cost; his lieutenant's pay of four shillings a day (£70 a year) contrasted with the £500 a year he had earned as captain of "Britannia". Because of the limited number of warrant officers allowed on "Bounty", Bligh was also required to act as the ship's <a href="purser">purser</a>. His sailing orders stated that he was to enter the Pacific via <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> around <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and then, after collecting the breadfruit plants, sail westward through the <a href="Endeavour%20Strait">Endeavour Strait</a> and across the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian</a> and <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Ocean">South Atlantic Oceans</a> to the West Indies islands in the Caribbean. "Bounty" would thus complete a <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigation</a> of the Earth in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>.

<a href="Complement%20of%20HMS%20Bounty">"Bounty"'s complement</a> was 46 men, comprising 44 Royal Navy seamen (including Bligh) and two civilian botanists. Directly beneath Bligh were his <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a>s, appointed by the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> and headed by the sailing master <a href="John%20Fryer%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Fryer</a>. The other warrant officers were the <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a>, the <a href="Ship%27s%20doctor">surgeon</a>, the carpenter, and the gunner. To the two <a href="master%27s%20mate">master's mate</a>s and two <a href="midshipman">midshipmen</a> were added several honorary midshipmen—so-called "<a href="young%20gentlemen">young gentlemen</a>" who were aspirant naval officers. These signed the ship's roster as able seamen, but were quartered with the midshipmen and treated on equal terms with them.

Most of "Bounty"'s crew were chosen by Bligh or were recommended to him by influential patrons. William Peckover the gunner and Joseph Coleman the armourer had been with Cook and Bligh on HMS "Resolution"; several others had sailed under Bligh more recently on the "Britannia". Among these was the 23-year-old <a href="Fletcher%20Christian">Fletcher Christian</a>, who came from a wealthy <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> family descended from <a href="Manx%20people">Manx</a> gentry. Christian had chosen a life at sea rather than the legal career envisaged by his family. He had twice voyaged with Bligh to the West Indies, and the two had formed a master-pupil relationship through which Christian had become a skilled navigator. Christian was willing to serve on "Bounty" without pay as one of the "young gentlemen"; Bligh gave him one of the salaried master's mate's berths. Another of the young gentlemen recommended to Bligh was 15-year-old <a href="Peter%20Heywood">Peter Heywood</a>, also from a Manx family and a distant relation of Christian's. Heywood had left school at 14 to spend a year on , a harbour-bound training vessel at Plymouth. His recommendation to Bligh came from Richard Betham, a Heywood family friend who was Bligh's father-in-law.

The two botanists, or "gardeners", were chosen by Banks. The chief botanist, <a href="David%20Nelson%20%28botanical%20collector%29">David Nelson</a>, was a veteran of Cook's third expedition who had been to Tahiti and had learned some of the natives' language. Nelson's assistant William Brown was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French. Banks also helped to secure the official midshipmen's berths for two of his protégés, <a href="Thomas%20Hayward%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Hayward</a> and <a href="John%20Hallett">John Hallett</a>. Overall, "Bounty"'s crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30; at the time of departure, Bligh was 33 years old. Among the older crew members were the 39-year-old Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, a year older and formerly sailmaker on the "Britannia". The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, both 15 when they left England.

Living space on the ship was allocated on the basis of rank. Bligh, having yielded the great cabin, occupied private sleeping quarters with an adjacent dining area or pantry on the <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side of the ship, and Fryer a small cabin on the opposite side. The surgeon Thomas Huggan, the other warrant officers, and Nelson the botanist had tiny cabins on the lower deck, while the master's mates and the midshipmen, together with the young gentlemen, berthed together in an area behind the captain's dining room known as the <a href="Cockpit%20%28sailing%29">cockpit</a>; as junior or prospective officers, they were allowed use of the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. The other ranks had their quarters in the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, a windowless unventilated area measuring with headroom of .

On 15 October 1787, "Bounty" left <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a> for <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>, in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, to await final sailing orders. Adverse weather delayed arrival at Spithead until 4 November. Bligh was anxious to depart quickly, to reach Cape Horn before the end of the short southern summer, but the Admiralty did not accord him high priority and delayed issuing the orders for a further three weeks. When "Bounty" finally sailed on 28 November, the ship was trapped by contrary winds and unable to clear Spithead until 23 December. With the prospect of a passage around Cape Horn now in serious doubt, Bligh received permission from the Admiralty to take, if necessary, an alternative route to Tahiti via the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>.

As the ship settled into her sea-going routine, Bligh introduced Cook's strict discipline regarding sanitation and diet. According to the expedition's historian Sam McKinney, Bligh enforced these rules "with a fanatical zeal, continually fuss[ing] and fum[ing] over the cleanliness of his ship and the food served to the crew." He replaced the navy's traditional <a href="watch%20system">watch system</a> of alternating four-hour spells on and off duty with a three-watch system, whereby each four-hour duty was followed by eight hours' rest. For the crew's exercise and entertainment, he introduced regular music and dancing sessions. Bligh's despatches to Campbell and Banks indicated his satisfaction; he had no occasion to administer punishment because, he wrote: "Both men and officers tractable and well disposed, & cheerfulness & content in the countenance of every one". The only adverse feature of the voyage to date, according to Bligh, was the conduct of the surgeon Huggan, who was revealed as an indolent, unhygienic drunkard.

From the start of the voyage, Bligh had established warm relations with Christian, according him a status which implied that he was Bligh's second-in-command rather than Fryer. On 2 March, Bligh formalised the position by assigning Christian to the rank of Acting Lieutenant. Fryer showed little outward sign of resentment at his junior's advancement, but his relations with Bligh significantly worsened from this point. A week after the promotion, and on Fryer's insistence, Bligh ordered the flogging of <a href="Matthew%20Quintal">Matthew Quintal</a>, who received 12 lashes for "insolence and mutinous behaviour", thereby destroying Bligh's expressed hope of a voyage free from such punishment.

On 2 April, as "Bounty" approached Cape Horn, a strong gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which, Bligh wrote, "exceeded what I had ever met with before ... with severe squalls of hail and sleet". The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, she was further north than she had been a week earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, and that they would turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope—"to the great joy of every person on Board", Bligh recorded.

On 24 May 1788, "Bounty" anchored in <a href="False%20Bay">False Bay</a>, east of the Cape of Good Hope, where five weeks were spent in repairs and reprovisioning. Bligh's letters home emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were, by comparison with other vessels, and expressed hope that he would receive credit for this. At one stage during the sojourn, Bligh lent Christian money, a gesture that the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger man. In her account of the voyage, <a href="Caroline%20Alexander%20%28author%29">Caroline Alexander</a> describes the loan as "a significant act of friendship", but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget.

After leaving False Bay on 1 July, "Bounty" set out across the southern Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, <a href="Adventure%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Adventure Bay</a> in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. They passed the remote <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Saint-Paul">Île Saint-Paul</a>, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, but he did not attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.
The "Bounty" party spent their time at Adventure Bay in recuperation, fishing, replenishment of water casks, and felling timber. There were peaceful encounters with the native population. The first sign of overt discord between Bligh and his officers occurred when the captain exchanged angry words with William Purcell the carpenter over the latter's methods for cutting wood. Bligh ordered Purcell back to the ship and, when the carpenter stood his ground, Bligh withheld his rations, which "immediately brought him to his senses", according to Bligh.

Further clashes occurred on the final leg of the journey to Tahiti. On 9 October, Fryer refused to sign the ship's account books unless Bligh provided him with a certificate attesting to his complete competence throughout the voyage. Bligh would not be coerced. He summoned the crew and read the <a href="Articles%20of%20War">Articles of War</a>, at which Fryer backed down. There was also trouble with the surgeon Huggan, whose careless <a href="blood-letting">blood-letting</a> of able seaman James Valentine while treating him for <a href="asthma">asthma</a> led to the seaman's death from a <a href="blood%20infection">blood infection</a>. To cover his error, the surgeon reported to Bligh that Valentine had died from <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, which led Bligh to apply his own medicinal and dietary <a href="antiscorbutic">antiscorbutic</a> remedies to the entire ship's company. By now, Huggan was almost incapacitated with drink, until Bligh confiscated his supply. Huggan briefly returned to duty; before "Bounty"'s arrival in Tahiti, he examined all on board for signs of <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a> and found none. "Bounty" came to anchor in <a href="Matavai%20Bay">Matavai Bay</a>, Tahiti on 26 October 1788, concluding a journey of .

Bligh's first action on arrival was to secure the co-operation of the local chieftains. The paramount chief Tynah remembered Bligh from Cook's voyage 15 years previously, and greeted him warmly. Bligh presented the chiefs with gifts and informed them that their own "<a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George</a>" wished in return only breadfruit plants. They happily agreed with this simple request. Bligh assigned Christian to lead a shore party charged with establishing a compound in which the plants would be nurtured.
Whether based ashore or on board, the men's duties during "Bounty's" five-month stay in Tahiti were relatively light. Many led promiscuous lives among the native women—altogether, 18 officers and men, including Christian, received treatment for venereal infections—while others took regular partners. Christian formed a close relationship with a Polynesian woman named Mauatua, to whom he gave the name "Isabella" after a former sweetheart from Cumberland. Bligh remained chaste himself, but was tolerant of his men's activities, unsurprised that they should succumb to temptation when "the allurements of dissipation are beyond any thing that can be conceived". Nevertheless, he expected them to do their duty efficiently, and was disappointed to find increasing instances of neglect and slackness on the part of his officers. Infuriated, he wrote: "Such neglectful and worthless petty officers I believe were never in a ship such as are in this".

Huggan died on 10 December. Bligh attributed this to "the effects of intemperance and indolence ... he never would be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time, through the whole course of the voyage". For all his earlier favoured status, Christian did not escape Bligh's wrath. He was often humiliated by the captain—sometimes in front of the crew and the Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became increasingly common. On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew—Charles Churchill, John Millward and <a href="William%20Muspratt">William Muspratt</a>—deserted, taking a small boat, arms and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect. Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot—the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh was persuaded that his protégé was not planning to desert, and the matter was dropped. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and, on their return to the ship, were flogged.

From February onwards, the pace of work increased; more than 1,000 breadfruit plants were potted and carried into the ship, where they filled the great cabin. The ship was overhauled for the long homeward voyage, in many cases by men who regretted the forthcoming departure and loss of their easy life with the Tahitians. Bligh was impatient to be away, but as <a href="Richard%20Hough">Richard Hough</a> observes in his account, he "failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea ... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti". The work was done by 1 April 1789, and four days later, after an affectionate farewell from Tynah and his queen, "Bounty" left the harbour.

In their "Bounty" histories, both Hough and Alexander maintain that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of <a href="James%20Morrison%20%28mutineer%29">James Morrison</a>, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to bear the brunt of the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.

On 22 April 1789, "Bounty" arrived at <a href="Nomuka">Nomuka</a>, in the <a href="Tonga">Friendly Islands</a> (now called Tonga), intending to pick up wood, water, and further supplies on the final scheduled stop before the Endeavour Strait. Bligh had visited the island with Cook, and knew that the inhabitants could behave unpredictably. He put Christian in charge of the watering party and equipped him with muskets, but at the same time ordered that the arms should be left in the boat, not carried ashore. Christian's party was harassed and threatened continually but were unable to retaliate, having been denied the use of arms. He returned to the ship with his task incomplete, and was cursed by Bligh as "a damned cowardly rascal". Further disorder ashore resulted in the thefts of a small anchor and an <a href="adze">adze</a>, for which Bligh further berated Fryer and Christian. In an attempt to recover the missing property, Bligh briefly detained the island's chieftains on the ship, but to no avail. When he finally gave the order to sail, neither the anchor nor the adze had been restored.

By 27 April, Christian was in a state of despair, depressed and brooding. His mood was worsened when Bligh accused him of stealing coconuts from the captain's private supply. Bligh punished the whole crew for this theft, stopping their rum ration and reducing their food by half. Feeling that his position was now intolerable, Christian considered constructing a raft with which he could escape to an island and take his chances with the natives. He may have acquired wood for this purpose from Purcell. In any event, his discontent became common knowledge among his fellow officers. Two of the young gentlemen, George Stewart and <a href="Ned%20Young">Edward Young</a>, urged him not to desert; Young assured him that he would have the support of almost all on board if he were to seize the ship and depose Bligh. Stewart told him the crew were "ripe for anything".

In the early hours of 28 April 1789, "Bounty" lay about south of the island of <a href="Tofua">Tofua</a>. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He understood from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh "called as loudly as [he] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to "lay down again, and hold my tongue or I was a dead man".

Bligh was brought to the quarterdeck, his hands bound by a cord held by Christian, who was brandishing a bayonet; some reports maintained that Christian had a <a href="Depth%20sounding%23Lead%20and%20Line">sounding plummet</a> hanging from his neck so that he could jump overboard and drown himself if the mutiny failed. Others who had been awakened by the noise left their berths and joined in the general pandemonium. It was unclear at this stage who were and who were not active mutineers. Hough describes the scene: "Everyone was, more or less, making a noise, either cursing, jeering or just shouting for the reassurance it gave them to do so". Bligh shouted continually, demanding to be set free, sometimes addressing individuals by name, and otherwise exhorting the company generally to "knock Christian down!" Fryer was briefly permitted on deck to speak to Christian, but was then forced below at bayonet-point; according to Fryer, Christian told him: "I have been in hell for weeks past. Captain Bligh has brought this on himself."

Christian originally thought to cast Bligh adrift in "Bounty"'s small <a href="jolly%20boat">jolly boat</a>, together with his clerk John Samuel and the loyalist midshipmen Hayward and Hallett. This boat proved unseaworthy, so Christian ordered the launching of a larger ship's boat, with a capacity of around ten. However, Christian and his allies had overestimated the extent of the mutiny—at least half on board were determined to leave with Bligh. Thus the ship's largest boat, a launch, was put into the water. During the following hours the loyalists collected their possessions and entered the boat. Among these was Fryer, who with Bligh's approval sought to stay on board—in the hope, he later claimed, that he would be able to retake the ship—but Christian ordered him into the launch. Soon, the vessel was badly overloaded, with more than 20 persons and others still vying for places. Christian ordered the two carpenter's mates, Norman and McIntosh, and the armourer, Joseph Coleman, to return to the ship, considering their presence essential if he were to navigate "Bounty" with a reduced crew. Reluctantly they obeyed, beseeching Bligh to remember that they had remained with the ship against their will. Bligh assured them: "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England".

Samuel saved the captain's journal, commission papers and purser's documents, but was forced to leave behind Bligh's maps and charts—15 years of navigational work. The launch was supplied with about five days' food and water, a sextant, compass and nautical tables, and Purcell's tool chest. At the last minute the mutineers threw four <a href="cutlass">cutlass</a>es down into the boat. Of "Bounty"'s complement—44 after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine—19 men were crowded into the launch, leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a>. The 25 men remaining on "Bounty" included the committed mutineers who had taken up arms, the loyalists detained against their will, and others for whom there was no room in the launch. At around 10:00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut; a little later, Bligh ordered a sail to be raised. Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua, clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano.

Bligh hoped to find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of <a href="Tongatapu">Tongatapu</a> to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in provisioning the boat for a voyage to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded the last of his shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.

The launch escaped to the open sea, where the shaken crew reconsidered their options. A visit to Tongatapu, or any island landfall, might incur similarly violent consequences; their best chance of salvation, Bligh reckoned, lay in sailing directly to the Dutch settlement of <a href="Kupang">Coupang</a> in <a href="Timor">Timor</a>, using the rations presently on board. This was a journey of some to the west, beyond the Endeavour Strait, and it would necessitate daily rations of an ounce of bread and a quarter-pint of water for each man. The plan was unanimously agreed.

From the outset, the weather was wet and stormy, with mountainous seas that constantly threatened to overwhelm the boat. When the sun appeared, Bligh noted in his daily journal that it "gave us as much pleasure as a winter's day in England". Bligh endeavoured to continue his journal throughout the voyage, observing, sketching, and charting as they made their way west. To keep up morale, he told stories of his prior experiences at sea, got the men singing, and occasionally said prayers. The launch made the first passage by Europeans through the <a href="Fiji">Fiji Islands</a>, but they dared not stop because of the islanders' reputation for cannibalism. On 17 May, Bligh recorded that "our situation was miserable; always wet, and suffering extreme cold ... without the least shelter from the weather".

A week later with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, signalling a proximity to land. On 28 May, the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named <a href="Ma%E2%80%99alpiku%20Island%20National%20Park%23History">Restoration Island</a>, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply and were able to eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.

On 2 June, the launch cleared <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York</a>, the extreme northern point of the Australian continent. Bligh turned south-west, and steered through a maze of shoals, reefs, sandbanks, and small islands. The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait, but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel. At 20:00 that evening, they reached the open <a href="Arafura%20Sea">Arafura Sea</a>, still from Coupang. The following eight days encompassed some of the toughest travel of the entire journey and, by 11 June, many were close to collapse. The next day, the coast of Timor was sighted: "It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us", Bligh wrote. On 14 June, with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted, they sailed into Coupang harbour.

In Coupang, Bligh reported the mutiny to the authorities, and wrote to his wife: "Know then, my own Dear Betsey, I have lost the "Bounty" ..." Nelson the botanist quickly succumbed to the harsh Coupang climate and died. On 20 August, the party departed for <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (now Jakarta) to await a ship for Europe; the cook Thomas Hall died there, having been ill for weeks. Bligh obtained passages home for himself, his clerk Samuel, and his servant John Smith, and sailed on 16 October 1789. Four of the remainder—the master's mate Elphinstone, the quartermaster Peter Linkletter, the butcher Robert Lamb and the assistant surgeon Thomas Ledward—all died either in Batavia or on their journeys home.

After the departure of Bligh's launch, Christian divided the personal effects of the departed loyalists among the remaining crew and threw the breadfruit plants into the sea. He recognised that Bligh could conceivably survive to report the mutiny, and that anyway the non-return of "Bounty" would occasion a search mission, with Tahiti as its first port of call. Christian therefore headed "Bounty" towards the small island of <a href="Tubuai">Tubuai</a>, some south of Tahiti. Tubuai had been discovered and roughly charted by Cook; except for a single small channel, it was entirely surrounded by a coral reef and could, Christian surmised, be easily defended against any attack from the sea.
"Bounty" arrived at Tubuai on 28 May 1789. The reception from the native population was hostile; when a flotilla of war canoes headed for the ship, Christian used a four-pounder gun to repel the attackers. At least a dozen warriors were killed, and the rest scattered. Undeterred, Christian and an armed party surveyed the island, and decided it would be suitable for their purposes. However, to create a permanent settlement, they needed compliant native labour and women. The most likely source for these was Tahiti, to which "Bounty" returned on 6 June. To ensure the co-operation of the Tahiti chiefs, Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh, and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at <a href="Aitutaki">Aitutaki</a>. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods and, on 16 June, the well-provisioned "Bounty" sailed back to Tubuai. On board were nearly 30 Tahitian men and women, some of whom were there by deception.

For the next two months, Christian and his forces struggled to establish themselves on Tubuai. They began to construct a large moated enclosure—called "Fort George", after the British king—to provide a secure fortress against attack by land or sea. Christian attempted to form friendly relations with the local chiefs, but his party was unwelcome. There were persistent clashes with the native population, mainly over property and women, culminating in a pitched battle in which 66 islanders were killed and many wounded. Discontent was rising among the "Bounty" party, and Christian sensed that his authority was slipping. He called a meeting to discuss future plans and offered a free vote. Eight remained loyal to Christian, the hard core of the active mutineers, but sixteen wished to return to Tahiti and take their chances there. Christian accepted this decision; after depositing the majority at Tahiti, he would "run before the wind, and ... land upon the first island the ship drives. After what I have done I cannot remain at Tahiti".

When "Bounty" returned to Tahiti, on 22 September, the welcome was much less effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship that the story of Cook and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent, and did not stay long. Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed 15 ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his skills as an armourer.

That evening, Christian inveigled aboard "Bounty" a party of Tahitians, mainly women, for a social gathering. With the festivities under way, he cut the anchor rope and "Bounty" sailed away with her captive guests. Coleman escaped by diving overboard and reached land. Among the abducted group were six elderly women, for whom Christian had no use; he put them ashore on the nearby island of <a href="Mo%27orea">Mo'orea</a>. "Bounty"'s complement now comprised nine mutineers—Christian, Young, Quintal, Brown, Martin, John Williams, <a href="William%20McCoy%20%28mutineer%29">William McCoy</a>, John Mills, and <a href="John%20Adams%20%28mutineer%29">John Adams</a> (known by the crew as "Alexander Smith")—and 20 Polynesians, of whom 14 were women.

The 16 sailors on Tahiti began to organise their lives. One group, led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh, began building a schooner, which they named "Resolution" after Cook's ship. Morrison had not been an active mutineer; rather than waiting for recapture, he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there, hoping that such action would confirm his innocence. Morrison's group maintained ship's routine and discipline, even to the extent of holding divine service each Sunday. Churchill and Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson, who was in turn killed by Churchill's native friends. Others, such as Stewart and Heywood, settled into quiet domesticity; Heywood spent much of his time studying the <a href="Tahitian%20language">Tahitian language</a>. He adopted native dress and, in accordance with the local custom, was heavily tattooed on his body.

When Bligh landed in England on 14 March 1790, news of the mutiny had preceded him and he was fêted as a hero. In October 1790 at a formal <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> for the loss of "Bounty", he was honourably acquitted of responsibility for the loss and was promoted to post-captain. As an adjunct to the court martial, Bligh brought charges against Purcell for misconduct and insubordination; the former carpenter received a reprimand.

In November 1790, the Admiralty despatched the frigate <a href="HMS%20Pandora%20%281779%29">HMS "Pandora"</a> under Captain <a href="Edward%20Edwards%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Edward Edwards</a> to capture the mutineers and return them to England to stand trial. "Pandora" arrived at Tahiti on 23 March 1791 and, within a few days, all 14 surviving "Bounty" men had either surrendered or been captured. Edwards made no distinction between mutineers and those who claimed they had been detained on "Bounty" unwillingly; all were incarcerated in a specially constructed prison erected on "Pandora"'s quarterdeck, dubbed "Pandora's Box". "Pandora" remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards unsuccessfully sought information on "Bounty's" whereabouts. The ship finally sailed on 8 May, to search for Christian and "Bounty" among the thousands of southern Pacific islands. Apart from a few spars discovered at <a href="Palmerston%20Island">Palmerston Island</a>, no traces of the fugitive vessel were found. Edwards continued the search until August, when he turned west and headed for the Dutch East Indies.
On 29 August 1791, "Pandora" ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef. The men in "Pandora's Box" were ignored as the regular crew attempted to prevent the ship from foundering. When Edwards gave the order to abandon ship, "Pandora"s armourer began to remove the prisoners' shackles, but the ship sank before he had finished. Heywood and nine other prisoners escaped; four "Bounty" men—George Stewart, Henry Hillbrant, Richard Skinner and John Sumner—drowned, along with 31 of "Pandora"'s crew. The survivors, including the ten remaining prisoners, then embarked on an open-boat journey that largely followed Bligh's course of two years earlier. The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot until they reached Coupang on 17 September.

The prisoners were confined for seven weeks, at first in prison and later on a Dutch East India Company ship, before being transported to Cape Town. On 5 April 1792, they embarked for England on a British warship, , and arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June. There they were transferred to the guardship to await trial. The prisoners included the three detained loyalists—Coleman, McIntosh and Norman—to whom Bligh had promised justice, the blind fiddler Michael Byrne (or "Byrn"), Heywood, Morrison, and four active mutineers: Thomas Burkett, John Millward, Thomas Ellison and William Muspratt. Bligh, who had been given command of <a href="HMS%20Providence%20%281791%29">HMS "Providence"</a> for a second breadfruit expedition, had left England in August 1791, and thus would be absent from the pending court martial proceedings.

The court martial opened on 12 September 1792 on in <a href="Portsmouth%20harbour">Portsmouth harbour</a>, with Vice-Admiral <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Lord Hood</a>, <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Portsmouth">Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth</a>, presiding. Heywood's family secured him competent legal advisers; of the other defendants, only Muspratt employed legal counsel. The survivors of Bligh's open-boat journey gave evidence against their former comrades—the testimonies from Thomas Hayward and John Hallett were particularly damaging to Heywood and Morrison, who each maintained their innocence of any mutinous intention and had surrendered voluntarily to "Pandora". The court did not challenge the statements of Coleman, McIntosh, Norman and Byrne, all of whom were acquitted. On 18 September the six remaining defendants were found guilty of mutiny and were sentenced to death by hanging, with recommendations of mercy for Heywood and Morrison "in consideration of various circumstances".

On 26 October 1792 Heywood and Morrison received <a href="Royal%20prerogative%20of%20mercy">royal pardons</a> from King George III and were released. Muspratt, through his lawyer, won a <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a> by filing a petition protesting that court martial rules had prevented his calling Norman and Byrne as witnesses in his defence. He was still awaiting the outcome when Burkett, Ellison and Millward were hanged from the <a href="yardarm">yardarm</a> of in Portsmouth dock on 28 October. Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment, while others speak of their "manly firmness that ... was the admiration of all". There was some unease expressed in the press—a suspicion that "money had bought the lives of some, and others fell sacrifice to their poverty." A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded; nevertheless, Dening asserts that "in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference." In December Muspratt heard that he was reprieved, and on 11 February 1793 he, too, was pardoned and freed.

Much of the court martial testimony was critical of Bligh's conduct—by the time of his return to England in August 1793, following his successful conveyance of breadfruit to the West Indies aboard "Providence", professional and public opinion had turned against him. He was snubbed at the Admiralty when he went to present his report, and was left on half pay for 19 months before receiving his next appointment. In late 1794 the jurist <a href="Edward%20Christian">Edward Christian</a>, brother of Fletcher, published his "Appendix" to the court martial proceedings, which was said by the press to "palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh". Bligh's position was further undermined when the loyalist gunner Peckover confirmed that much of what was alleged in the "Appendix" was true.

Bligh commanded <a href="HMS%20Director%20%281784%29">HMS "Director"</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camperdown">Battle of Camperdown</a> in October 1797 and <a href="HMS%20Glatton%20%281795%29">HMS "Glatton"</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Copenhagen%20%281801%29">Battle of Copenhagen</a> in April 1801. In 1805 while commanding <a href="HMS%20Warrior%20%281781%29">HMS "Warrior"</a>, he was court-martialled for using bad language to his officers, and reprimanded. In 1806, he was appointed <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in Australia; after two years a group of army officers arrested and deposed him in the <a href="Rum%20Rebellion">Rum Rebellion</a>. After his return to England, Bligh was promoted to <a href="rear-admiral">rear-admiral</a> in 1811 and <a href="vice-admiral">vice-admiral</a> in 1814, but was not offered further naval appointments. He died, aged 63, in December 1817.

Of the pardoned mutineers, Heywood and Morrison returned to naval duty. Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and, by 1803 at the age of 31, had achieved the rank of captain. After a distinguished career, he died in 1831. Morrison became a master gunner, and was eventually lost in 1807 when <a href="HMS%20Blenheim%20%281761%29">HMS "Blenheim"</a> foundered in the Indian Ocean. Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death, in or before 1798. The other principal participants in the court martial—Fryer, Peckover, Coleman, McIntosh and others—generally vanished from the public eye after the closing of the procedures.

After leaving Tahiti on 22 September 1789, Christian sailed "Bounty" west in search of a safe haven. He then formed the idea of settling on <a href="Pitcairn%20Island">Pitcairn Island</a>, far to the east of Tahiti; the island had been reported in 1767, but its exact location was never verified. After months of searching, Christian rediscovered the island on 15 January 1790, east of its recorded position. This longitudinal error contributed to the mutineers' decision to settle on Pitcairn.
On arrival the ship was unloaded and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed upon precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal—in either case, there was now no means of escape. 

The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited and virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water, and fertile land. For a while, the mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Isabella; a son, <a href="Thursday%20October%20Christian%20I">Thursday October Christian</a>, was born, as were other children. Christian's authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.

Gradually, tensions and rivalries arose over the increasing extent to which the Europeans regarded the Tahitians as their property, in particular the women who, according to Alexander, were "passed around from one 'husband' to the other". In September 1793 matters degenerated into extreme violence, when five of the mutineers—Christian, Williams, Martin, Mills, and Brown—were killed by Tahitians in a carefully executed series of murders. Christian was set upon while working in his fields, first shot and then butchered with an axe; his last words, supposedly, were: "Oh, dear!" In-fighting continued thereafter, and by 1794 the six Tahitian men were all dead, killed either by the widows of the murdered mutineers or by each other. Two of the four surviving mutineers, Young and Adams, assumed leadership and secured a tenuous calm, which was disrupted by the drunkenness of McCoy and Quintal's after the former distilled an alcoholic beverage from a local plant. 

Some of the women attempted to leave the island in a makeshift boat but could not launch it successfully. Life continued uneasily until McCoy's suicide in 1798. A year later, after Quintal threatened fresh murder and mayhem, Adams and Young killed him and were able to restore peace.

After Young succumbed to asthma in 1800, Adams took responsibility for the education and well-being of the nine remaining women and 19 children. Using the <a href="Bounty%20Bible">ship's Bible</a> from "Bounty", he taught literacy and Christianity, and kept peace on the island. This was the situation in February 1808, when the American sealer "Topaz" came unexpectedly upon Pitcairn, landed, and discovered the, by then, thriving community. News of "Topaz"'s discovery did not reach Britain until 1810, when it was overlooked by an Admiralty preoccupied by war with France. 

In 1814, two British warships, <a href="HMS%20Briton%20%281812%29">HMS "Briton"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Tagus%20%281813%29">HMS "Tagus"</a>, chanced upon Pitcairn. Among those who greeted them were Thursday October Christian and George Young (Edward Young's son). The captains, <a href="Thomas%20Staines">Sir Thomas Staines</a> and <a href="Philip%20Pipon">Philip Pipon</a>, reported that Christian's son displayed "in his benevolent countenance, all the features of an honest English face". On shore they found a population of 46 mainly young islanders led by Adams, upon whom the islanders' welfare was wholly dependent, according to the captains' report. After receiving Staines's and Pipon's report, the Admiralty decided to take no action. 

In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of the foundation of the Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered "Bounty" artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.

The perception of Bligh as an overbearing tyrant began with Edward Christian's "Appendix" of 1794. Apart from Bligh's journal, the first published account of the mutiny was that of <a href="Sir%20John%20Barrow%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Barrow</a>, published in 1831. Barrow was a friend of the Heywood family; his book mitigated Heywood's role while emphasising Bligh's severity. The book also instigated the legend that Christian had not died on Pitcairn, but had somehow returned to England and been recognised by Heywood in Plymouth, around 1808–1809. An account written in 1870 by Heywood's stepdaughter Diana Belcher further exonerated Heywood and Christian and, according to Bligh biographer Caroline Alexander, "cemented ... many falsehoods that had insinuated their way into the narrative".

For public perception, Bligh was unfortunate in his timing: The story of the mutiny became public knowledge when the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poets first commanded the literary scene. Bligh's chief apologist was Sir Joseph Banks, while Christian was championed by <a href="William%20Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a>.

Among historians' attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough (1972) and Caroline Alexander (2003). Hough depicts ""an unsurpassed foul-weather commander ... I would go through hell and high water with him, but not for one day in the same ship on a calm sea"". Alexander presents Bligh as over-anxious, solicitous of his crew's well-being, and utterly devoted to his task, however Bligh's reputation as the archetypal bad commander remains: the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>"'s reviewer of Alexander's book wrote "poetry routed science and it has held the field ever since".

In addition to many books and articles about the mutiny, in the 20th century five feature films were produced. The first was <a href="The%20Mutiny%20of%20the%20Bounty">a 1916 silent Australian film</a>, subsequently lost. The second, also from Australia, entitled "<a href="In%20the%20Wake%20of%20the%20Bounty">In the Wake of the Bounty</a>" (1933), and was the screen debut of <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> in the role of Christian. The impact of this film was overshadowed by that of the <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> version, <a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty%20%281935%20film%29">"Mutiny on the Bounty"</a> (1935), based on the popular <a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty%20%28novel%29">namesake novel</a> by <a href="Charles%20Nordhoff">Charles Nordhoff</a> and <a href="James%20Norman%20Hall">James Norman Hall</a>, and starring <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a> and <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a> as Bligh and Christian, respectively. The film's story was presented, says Dening, as "the classic conflict between tyranny and a just cause"; Laughton's portrayal became in the public mind the definitive Bligh, "a byword for sadistic tyranny". 

The two subsequent major films, <a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty%20%281962%20film%29">"Mutiny on the Bounty" (1962)</a> with <a href="Trevor%20Howard">Trevor Howard</a> and <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, and "<a href="The%20Bounty%20%281984%20film%29">The Bounty</a>" (1984) with <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> and <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, largely perpetuated this image of Bligh and that of Christian as tragic hero. The latter film added a level of homoeroticism to the Bligh–Christian relationship.

In 1998, in advance of a BBC documentary film aimed at Bligh's rehabilitation, the respective descendants of the captain and Christian feuded over their contrary versions of the truth. Dea Birkett, the programme's presenter, suggested that "Christian versus Bligh has come to represent rebellion versus authoritarianism, a life constrained versus a life of freedom, sexual repression versus sexual licence."

Pelican

Pelicans are a <a href="genus">genus</a> of large <a href="water%20bird">water bird</a>s that make up the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Pelecanidae. They are characterised by a long <a href="beak">beak</a> and a large <a href="throat%20pouch">throat pouch</a> used for catching <a href="prey">prey</a> and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the <a href="Brown%20pelican">brown</a> and <a href="Peruvian%20pelican">Peruvian pelican</a>s. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging <a href="latitude">latitudinally</a> from the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> to the <a href="temperate%20zone">temperate zone</a>, though they are absent from interior South America and from <a href="polar%20region">polar region</a>s and the open ocean.

Long thought to be related to <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s, <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, <a href="tropicbird">tropicbird</a>s, and <a href="Sulidae">gannets and boobies</a>, pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the <a href="shoebill">shoebill</a> and <a href="hamerkop">hamerkop</a>, and are placed in the order <a href="Pelecaniformes">Pelecaniformes</a>. <a href="Ibis">Ibis</a>es, <a href="spoonbill">spoonbill</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, and <a href="bittern">bittern</a>s have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and <a href="New%20World">New World</a> lineages.

Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface. They are <a href="wikt%3Agregarious">gregarious</a> birds, travelling in flocks, <a href="Cooperative%20hunting">hunting cooperatively</a>, and breeding <a href="bird%20colony">colonially</a>. Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees. The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious. The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing. Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction, disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern. They also have a long history of cultural significance in <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, and in Christian and <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> <a href="iconography">iconography</a>.

The genus "Pelecanus" was first formally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1758 in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">tenth edition</a> of his "Systema Naturae"'. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. This early definition included frigatebirds, cormorants, and <a href="Sulidae">sulids</a>, as well as pelicans. The name comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word "pelekan" (πελεκάν), which is itself derived from the word "pelekys" (πέλεκυς) meaning "axe". In <a href="Classical%20Greece">classical</a> times, the word was applied to both the pelican and the woodpecker.

The family Pelecanidae was introduced (as Pelicanea) by the French <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque</a> in 1815.
Pelicans give their name to the Pelecaniformes, an <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> which has a varied taxonomic history. <a href="Tropicbird">Tropicbird</a>s, <a href="darter">darter</a>s, cormorants, gannets, boobies, and frigatebirds, all traditional members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, <a href="Phaethontiformes">Phaethontiformes</a>, and the remainder into the Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop, and the shoebill have now been transferred into the Pelecaniformes. Molecular evidence suggests that the shoebill and the hamerkop form a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to the pelicans, though some doubt exists as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.

The eight living pelican species were traditionally divided into two groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (<a href="Australian%20pelican">Australian</a>, <a href="Dalmatian%20pelican">Dalmatian</a>, <a href="Great%20white%20pelican">great white</a>, and <a href="American%20white%20pelican">American white pelican</a>s), and one containing four grey- or brown-plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees (<a href="Pink-backed%20pelican">pink-backed</a>, <a href="Spot-billed%20pelican">spot-billed</a> and <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s), or on sea rocks (<a href="Peruvian%20pelican">Peruvian pelican</a>). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a>, are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Leptopelicanus">Leptopelicanus</a>" but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.

DNA sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded quite different relationships; the three <a href="New%20World">New World</a> pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister to the two brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed, and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage, but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.

The fossil record shows that the pelican lineage has existed for at least 30 million years; the oldest known pelican fossil was found in <a href="Early%20Oligocene">Early Oligocene</a> deposits at the <a href="Luberon">Luberon</a> in southeastern France, and is remarkably similar to modern forms. Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present-day pelicans, showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time. An <a href="Early%20Miocene">Early Miocene</a> <a href="fossil">fossil</a> has been named "<a href="Miopelecanus">Miopelecanus gracilis</a>" on the basis of certain features originally considered unique, but later thought to lie within the range of interspecific variation in "Pelecanus". The <a href="Late%20Eocene">Late Eocene</a> "<a href="Protopelicanus">Protopelicanus</a>" may be a pelecaniform or suliform – or a similar aquatic bird such as a pseudotooth (<a href="Pelagornithidae">Pelagornithidae</a>). The supposed <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> pelican "<a href="Liptornis">Liptornis</a>" from <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> is a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>" (of doubtful validity), being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description.

Fossil finds from North America have been meagre compared with Europe, which has a richer fossil record. Several "Pelecanus" species have been described from fossil material, including:

Pelicans are very large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at the end of the upper mandible, and the attachment of a huge <a href="gular%20skin">gular</a> pouch to the lower. The slender <a href="Ramus%20of%20the%20mandible">rami</a> of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish, and sometimes rainwater, though not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin, enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s.

Males are generally larger than females and have longer bills. The smallest species is the brown pelican, small individuals of which can be no more than and long, with a wingspan of as little as . The largest is believed to be the Dalmatian, at up to and in length, with a maximum wingspan of . The Australian pelican's bill may grow up to long in large males, the longest of any bird.

Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies of the brown pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey <a href="down%20feather">down</a>.

Anatomical dissections of two brown pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of subcutaneous <a href="Bird%20anatomy%23Skeletal%20system">air sacs</a> under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast, and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs are connected to the airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its <a href="glottis">glottis</a>, but how air sacs are inflated is not clear. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen, where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.

Modern pelicans are found on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian pelicans in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>) and 60° North (American white pelicans in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, as well as from the eastern coast of South America from the mouth of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand's <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).

Pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub the backs of their heads on their <a href="preen%20gland">preen gland</a>s to pick up an oily secretion, which they transfer to their <a href="plumage">plumage</a> to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote <a href="evaporative%20cooling">evaporative cooling</a>. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks, and in shallow water.

A fibrous layer deep in the breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring. Thus, they use <a href="thermal">thermal</a>s for soaring to heights of 3000 m (10,000 ft) or more, combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in <a href="V%20formation">V formation</a>, to commute distances up to to feeding areas. Pelicans also fly low (or "skim") over stretches of water, using a phenomenon known as <a href="Ground%20effect%20%28aircraft%29">ground effect</a> to reduce <a href="Lift-induced%20drag">drag</a> and increase <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>. As the air flows between the wings and the water surface, it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above. Hence, substantial energy is saved while flying.

Adult pelicans rely on visual displays and behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. <a href="Agonistic%20behaviour">Agonistic behaviour</a> consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy, as chicks vocalise extensively.

Pelicans are <a href="wikt%3Agregarious">gregarious</a> and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest. The ground-nesting (white) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air, on land, or in the water while pointing, gaping, and thrusting their bills at each other. They can finish the process in a day. The tree-nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females. The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat, although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food.

The Australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic</a> <a href="Lake%20Eyre%20basin">Lake Eyre basin</a>, pelicans breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill <a href="ephemeral">ephemeral</a> <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>s and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.

In all species, copulation takes place at the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10 days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.

The eggs are oval, white, and coarsely textured. All species normally lay at least two eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95%, but because of sibling competition or <a href="siblicide">siblicide</a>, in the wild, usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by <a href="regurgitation%20%28digestion%29">regurgitation</a>; after about a week, they are able to put their heads into their parents' pouches and feed themselves. Sometimes before, but especially after being fed the pelican chick may seem to "throw a tantrum" by loudly vocalizing and dragging itself around in a circle by one wing and leg, striking its head on the ground or anything nearby and the tantrums sometimes end in what looks like a <a href="seizure">seizure</a> that results in the chick falling briefly unconscious; the reason is not clearly known, but a common belief is that it is to draw attention to itself and away from any siblings who are waiting to be fed.

Parents of ground-nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by the head before feeding them. From about 25 days old, the young of these species gather in "pods" or "<a href="Cr%C3%A8che%20%28zoology%29">crèches</a>" of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring. By 6–8 weeks they wander around, occasionally swimming, and may practise communal feeding. Young of all species <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 10–12 weeks after hatching. They may remain with their parents afterwards, but are now seldom or never fed. They are mature at three or four years old. Overall breeding success is highly variable. Pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in the wild, although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity.

The diet of pelicans usually consists of fish, but occasionally <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, turtles, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="insect">insect</a>s, birds, and mammals are also eaten. The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa, the pink-backed pelican generally takes fish ranging in size from <a href="Juvenile%20fish">fry</a> up to and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to , but in Europe, the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to . In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey. Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmantian, pink-backed, and spot-billed pelicans are the only ones to prefer solitary feeding. When fishing in groups, all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey, and Dalmantian pelicans may even cooperate with <a href="great%20cormorant">great cormorant</a>s. They catch multiple small fish by expanding the throat pouch, which must be drained above the water surface before swallowing. This operation takes up to a minute, during which time other seabirds may <a href="kleptoparasitism">steal</a> the fish.
Large fish are caught with the bill-tip, then tossed up in the air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will sometimes stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes <a href="Kleptoparasitism">snatch prey</a> from other waterbirds.

The brown pelican usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height as great as , especially for <a href="anchovy">anchovies</a> and <a href="menhaden">menhaden</a>. The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then scooping up the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken at or near the water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a> and <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a> that forages in <a href="landfill">landfill</a> sites, as well as taking <a href="carrion">carrion</a> and "anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs". Food is not stored in a pelican's throat pouch, contrary to popular folklore.

Great white pelicans have been observed swallowing <a href="city%20pigeon">city pigeon</a>s in <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Park">St. James's Park</a> in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semiurban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa, eggs and chicks of the <a href="Cape%20cormorant">Cape cormorant</a> are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including <a href="Cape%20gannet">Cape gannet</a> chicks on <a href="Malgas%20Island">Malgas Island</a> as well as <a href="crowned%20cormorant">crowned cormorant</a>s, <a href="kelp%20gull">kelp gull</a>s, <a href="greater%20crested%20tern">greater crested tern</a>s, and <a href="African%20penguin">African penguin</a>s on <a href="Dassen%20Island">Dassen Island</a> and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly willing to take a wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young <a href="Australian%20white%20ibis">Australian white ibis</a>, and young and adult <a href="grey%20teal">grey teal</a>s and <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a>s. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young <a href="common%20murre">common murre</a>s in California and the eggs and nestlings of <a href="cattle%20egret">cattle egret</a>s and nestling <a href="great%20egret">great egret</a>s in <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of <a href="imperial%20shag">imperial shag</a>s, juvenile <a href="Peruvian%20diving%20petrel">Peruvian diving petrel</a>s, and <a href="grey%20gull">grey gull</a>s. <a href="Cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">Cannibalism</a> of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown, and Peruvian pelicans.

Globally, pelican populations are adversely affected by these main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and the presence of pollutants such as <a href="DDT">DDT</a> and <a href="endrin">endrin</a>. Most species' populations are more or less stable, although three are classified by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.

The combined population of brown and Peruvian pelicans is estimated at 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a> estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely as a consequence of environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.

The Peruvian pelican is listed as near threatened because, although the population is estimated by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño</a> event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Niño years, restricting human access to important breeding colonies, and assessing interactions with fisheries.

The spot-billed pelican has an estimated population between 13,000 and 18,000 and is considered to be near threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important <a href="Sittaung%20River">Sittaung valley</a> breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites. The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance, but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.

The pink-backed pelican has a large population ranging over much of <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of least concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulation</a> of toxins and the destruction of nesting trees by logging.

The American white pelican has increased in numbers, with its population estimated at over 157,000 birds in 2005, becoming more numerous east of the continental divide, while declining in the west. However, whether its numbers have been affected by exposure to pesticides is unclear, as it has also lost habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers.
Great white pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in numbers is uncertain, with a mix of regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable, or unknown, but no evidence has been found of rapid overall decline, and the status of the species is assessed as being of least concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.

The Dalmatian pelican has a population estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines, and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia, where it is nearly extinct. However, several European colonies are increasing in size and the largest colony for the species, at the <a href="Small%20Prespa%20Lake">Small Prespa Lake</a> in Greece, has reached about 1,400 breeding pairs following conservation measures.

Widespread across Australia, the Australian pelican has a population generally estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals. Overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success across the continent. The species is assessed as being of least concern.

Pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish, despite the fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in southeastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational <a href="cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat trout</a> fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and <a href="culling">culling</a>.

Great white pelicans on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape region of South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation of the eggs and chicks of <a href="guano">guano</a>-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants, and <a href="bank%20cormorant">bank cormorant</a>s. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.

Apart from habitat destruction and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers, and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.

DDT pollution in the environment was a major cause of decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic <a href="food%20web">food web</a>, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the <a href="northern%20anchovy">northern anchovy</a>. Its <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a> <a href="Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene">DDE</a> is a reproductive <a href="wikt%3Atoxicant">toxicant</a> in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.

In the late 1960s, following the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from <a href="botulism">botulism</a> after eating fish from the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a> in 1990. In 1991, abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and <a href="Brandt%27s%20cormorant">Brandt's cormorant</a>s died at <a href="Santa%20Cruz%2C%20California">Santa Cruz, California</a>, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxic</a> <a href="domoic%20acid">domoic acid</a>, produced by the <a href="diatom">diatom</a> "<a href="Pseudo-nitzschia">Pseudo-nitzschia</a>".

As waterbirds that feed on fish, pelicans are highly susceptible to <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s, both directly by being oiled and by the impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the <a href="Center%20for%20Biological%20Diversity">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, a year after the April 2010 <a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a>, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that 10 times that number had been harmed as a result of the spill.

Where pelicans interact with fishers, through either sharing the same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. <a href="Fish%20hook">Fish hook</a>s are swallowed or catch in the skin of the pouch or webbed feet, and strong <a href="monofilament%20fishing%20line">monofilament fishing line</a> can become wound around bill, wings, or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.

As with other bird families, pelicans are susceptible to a variety of <a href="parasitism">parasites</a>. Specialist <a href="bird%20louse">feather lice</a> of the genus "Piagetella" are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. <a href="Avian%20malaria">Avian malaria</a> is carried by the <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> "Culex pipens", and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. <a href="Leech">Leech</a>es may attach to the <a href="cloaca">vent</a> or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including <a href="cestoda">tapeworms</a>, <a href="trematoda">flukes</a>, <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="flea">flea</a>s, <a href="tick">tick</a>s, and <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the <a href="Argasidae">soft tick</a> "Ornithodoros capensis" sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several <a href="louse">lice</a> are very <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host-specific</a>.

Healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse "Piagetiella peralis", which occurs in the pouch, so cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes "Contracaecum multipapillatum" and "C. mexicanum" and the <a href="trematode">trematode</a> "Ribeiroia ondatrae" have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans were reported to have perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.

The pelican ("henet" in <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a>) was associated in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> with death and the <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>. It was depicted in art on the walls of tombs, and figured in <a href="funeral">funerary</a> texts, as a protective symbol against snakes. "Henet" was also referred to in the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a> as the "mother of the king" and thus seen as a goddess. References in nonroyal funerary <a href="papyrus">papyri</a> show that the pelican was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the <a href="underworld">underworld</a> for someone who had died.

Consumption of pelican, as with other <a href="seabirds">seabirds</a>, is considered not <a href="kosher">kosher</a> as an <a href="Unclean%20animal%23Judaism">unclean animal</a>, and thus forbidden in <a href="Jewish%20dietary%20law">Jewish dietary law</a>.

An <a href="origin%20myth">origin myth</a> from the <a href="Murri%20people">Murri people</a> of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, cited by <a href="Andrew%20Lang">Andrew Lang</a>, describes how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood to save drowning people. He fell in love with a woman he thus saved, but her friends and she tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.

The <a href="Moche%20culture">Moche</a> people of ancient <a href="Peru">Peru</a> worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted pelicans in their art.

<a href="Alcatraz%20Island">Alcatraz Island</a> was given its name by the Spanish because of the large numbers of brown pelicans nesting present. The word "alcatraz" is itself derived from the Arabic "al-caduos", a term used for a water-carrying vessel and likened to the pouch of the pelican. The English name albatross is also derived by corruption of the Spanish word.

In <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> Europe, the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available. As a result, the pelican came to symbolise the <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a> of Jesus and the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, and usurped the image of the <a href="lamb%20of%20God">lamb and the flag</a>. A reference to this mythical characteristic is contained for example in the hymn by <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas">Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>, "<a href="Adoro%20te%20devote">Adoro te devote</a>" or "Humbly We Adore Thee", where in the penultimate verse, he describes Christ as the "loving divine pelican, able to provide nourishment from his breast". <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a> adopted the symbol, portraying herself as the "mother of the Church of England". <a href="Nicholas%20Hilliard">Nicholas Hilliard</a> painted the "Pelican Portrait" around 1573, now owned by the <a href="Walker%20Art%20Gallery">Walker Art Gallery</a> in Liverpool. A pelican feeding her young is depicted in an oval panel at the bottom of the title page of the first (1611) edition of the <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">King James Bible</a>. Such "a pelican in her piety" appears in the 1686 <a href="reredos">reredos</a> by <a href="Grinling%20Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a> in the church of <a href="St%20Mary%20Abchurch">St Mary Abchurch</a> in the City of London. Earlier medieval examples of the motif appear in painted murals, for example that of "circa" 1350 in the <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of <a href="Belchamp%20Walter">Belchamp Walter</a>, Essex.

The self-sacrificial aspect of the pelican was reinforced by the widely read medieval <a href="bestiary">bestiaries</a>. The device of "a pelican in her piety" or "a pelican vulning (from Latin "vulno", "to wound") herself" was used in <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>. An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood, again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus. Likewise, a folktale from India says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment, but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood.

The legends of self-wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth.

Pelicans have featured extensively in heraldry, generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self-sacrificing parent. Heraldic images featuring a "pelican vulning" refers to a pelican injuring herself, while a "pelican in her piety" refers to a female pelican feeding her young with her own blood.

The image became linked to the medieval religious feast of <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20%28feast%29">Corpus Christi</a>. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge each have colleges named for the religious festival nearest the dates of their establishment, and both <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</a>, and <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Oxford">Corpus Christi College, Oxford</a>, feature pelicans on their coats of arms.

The medical faculties of <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">Charles University in Prague</a> also have a pelican as their emblem. The symbol of the <a href="Irish%20Blood%20Transfusion%20Service">Irish Blood Transfusion Service</a> is a pelican, and for most of its existence the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes with the image of the ship "<a href="Golden%20Hind">Golden Hind</a>". Sir <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>'s famous ship was initially called "Pelican", and adorned the British <a href="Halfpenny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">halfpenny coin</a>.

The great white pelican is the national bird of <a href="Romania">Romania</a>. The brown pelican is the national bird of three Caribbean countries—<a href="Saint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a>, <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, and <a href="Sint%20Maarten">Sint Maarten</a>—and features on their <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a>. It is also the state bird of the US state of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, which is known colloquially as the Pelican State; the bird appears on the <a href="Flag%20of%20Louisiana">state flag</a> and <a href="Seal%20of%20Louisiana">state seal</a>. It adorns the seals of <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a> and <a href="Tulane%20University">Tulane University</a>, and is the mascot of the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> NBA team, Tulane University, and the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">University of the West Indies</a>. A white pelican logo is used by the Portuguese bank <a href="Montepio%20Geral">Montepio Geral</a>, and a pelican is depicted on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the Albanian 1 <a href="Albanian%20lek">lek</a> coin, issued in 1996. The name and image were used for <a href="Pelican%20Books">Pelican Books</a>, an <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a> of nonfiction books published by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a>. The seal of the <a href="Packer%20Collegiate%20Institute">Packer Collegiate Institute</a>, a pelican feeding her young, has been in use since 1885.

The Christian Democratic political party known as the <a href="American%20Solidarity%20Party">American Solidarity Party</a> uses the pelican as its animal symbol, alluding to its Catholic social teaching platform.

The pelican is the subject of a popular <a href="Limerick%20%28poetry%29">limerick</a> originally composed by <a href="Dixon%20Lanier%20Merritt">Dixon Lanier Merritt</a> in 1910 with several variations by other authors. The original version ran:

Battle of Vimy Ridge

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>, in the <a href="Nord-Pas-de-Calais">Nord-Pas-de-Calais</a> region of <a href="France">France</a>, during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The main combatants were the four divisions of the <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian Corps</a> in the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a>, against three divisions of the German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">6th Army</a>. The battle took place from 9 to 12 April 1917 at the beginning of the Battle of Arras, the first attack of the <a href="Nivelle%20Offensive">Nivelle Offensive</a>, which was intended to attract German reserves from the French, before their attempt at a decisive offensive on the Aisne and the <a href="Chemin%20des%20Dames">Chemin des Dames</a> ridge further south.

The Canadian Corps was to capture the German-held high ground of Vimy Ridge, an <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> on the northern flank of the Arras front. This would protect the First Army and the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a> farther south from German <a href="enfilade">enfilade</a> fire. Supported by a <a href="creeping%20barrage">creeping barrage</a>, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of <a href="Th%C3%A9lus">Thélus</a> fell during the second day, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overran a <a href="Salients%2C%20re-entrants%20and%20pockets">salient</a> against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of <a href="Givenchy-en-Gohelle">Givenchy-en-Gohelle</a>, fell to the Canadians on 12 April. The 6th Army then retreated to the <a href="Oppy%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Oppy</a>–<a href="M%C3%A9ricourt%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Méricourt</a> line.

Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps to technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support and extensive training, as well as the German 6th Army’s failure to properly apply the new German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a> fought together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice. A portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Vimy%20Memorial">Canadian National Vimy Memorial</a>.

Vimy Ridge is an <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> northeast of <a href="Arras%2C%20France">Arras</a> on the western edge of the Douai Plain. The ridge rises gradually on its western side and drops more quickly on the eastern side. At approximately in length and culminating at an elevation of or above the Douai Plains, the ridge provides a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.

The ridge fell under German control in October 1914 during the <a href="Race%20to%20the%20Sea">Race to the Sea</a> as the Franco-British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">Tenth Army</a> attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Second Battle of Artois</a> in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Lorette">Notre Dame de Lorette</a>. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture the height of the ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Third Battle of Artois</a> in September 1915 but only captured the village of <a href="Souchez">Souchez</a> at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely <a href="Live%20and%20let%20live%20%28World%20War%20I%29">live and let live</a> approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.

The <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British XVII Corps</a>, commanded by <a href="Lieutenant-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Julian%20Byng%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Byng%20of%20Vimy">Sir Julian Byng</a>, relieved the French Tenth Army in the sector in February 1916, permitting the French to expand their operations at <a href="Verdun">Verdun</a>. The British soon discovered that German tunnelling companies had taken advantage of the relative calm on the surface to build an extensive network of <a href="Tunnel%20warfare">tunnels</a> and deep <a href="Mining%20%28military%29">mines</a> from which they would attack French positions by setting off explosive charges underneath their trenches. The <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> immediately deployed specialist <a href="Royal%20Engineer%20tunnelling%20companies">tunnelling companies</a> along the front to combat the German mining operations. In response to increased British mining aggression, German artillery and trench mortar fire intensified in early May 1916. On 21 May 1916, after shelling both forward trenches and divisional artillery positions from no less than 80 out-of-sight batteries on the reverse slope of the ridge, the German infantry began operation , an attack on the British lines along a front in an effort to eject them from positions along the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. Small counterattacks by units of the 140th and 141st British Brigades took place on 22 May but did not manage to change the situation. The Canadian Corps relieved the British <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IV Corps</a> stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.

On 28 May 1916, Byng took command of the Canadian Corps from Lieutenant-General Sir <a href="Edwin%20Alderson">Edwin Alderson</a>. Formal discussions for a spring offensive near <a href="Arras">Arras</a> began, following a conference of corps commanders held at the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> Headquarters on 21 November 1916. In March 1917, the First Army headquarters formally presented Byng with orders outlining Vimy Ridge as the Canadian Corps objective for the Arras Offensive. A formal assault plan, adopted in early March 1917, drew heavily on the briefings of staff officers sent to learn from the experiences of the French Army during the Battle of Verdun. For the first time the four Canadian divisions would fight together. The nature and size of the attack needed more resources than the Canadian Corps possessed; the British <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Division</a>, artillery, engineer and labour units were attached to the corps, bringing the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.

In January 1917, three Canadian Corps officers accompanied other British and Dominion officers attending a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a>. The French counter offensive devised by General <a href="Robert%20Nivelle">Robert Nivelle</a> had been one of a number of Allied successes of 1916. Following extensive rehearsal, eight French divisions had assaulted German positions in two waves along a front. Supported by extremely strong artillery, the French had recovered lost ground and inflicted heavy casualties on five German divisions.
On their return from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff officers produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional-level lectures to promote the primacy of artillery and stress the importance of harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility. The report of <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Division">1st Canadian Division</a> commander <a href="Arthur%20Currie">Arthur Currie</a> highlighted the lessons he believed the Canadian Corps could learn from the experiences of the French. The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew heavily on the experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures. British First Army commander <a href="General%20Officer">General</a> <a href="Henry%20Horne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Horne">Henry Horne</a> approved the plan on 5 March 1917.

The plan divided the Canadian Corps advance into four coloured objective lines. The attack would be made on a front of , with its centre opposite the village of <a href="Vimy">Vimy</a>, to the east of the ridge. The first objective, represented by the Black Line, was to seize the German forward defensive line. The final objective of the northern flank was the Red Line: taking the highest point on the ridge, the fortified knoll known as the Pimple, the Folie Farm, the Zwischen-Stellung trench and the hamlet of Les Tilleuls. The southern two divisions were to achieve two additional objectives: the Blue Line encompassing the village of Thélus and the woods outside the village of Vimy and the Brown Line, which aimed at capturing the Zwölfer-Graben trench and the German second line. The infantry would proceed close behind a <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29">creeping barrage</a> placed down by light field guns, advancing in timed increments. The medium and heavy <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s would establish a series of standing barrages further ahead of the infantry against known defensive systems.

The plan called for units to leapfrog over one another, as the advance progressed, to maintain momentum during the attack. The initial wave would capture and consolidate the Black Line and then push forward to the Red Line. The barrage would pause, to enable reserve units to move up and then move forward with the units pushing beyond the Red Line to the Blue Line. Once the corps secured the Blue Line, advancing units would once again leapfrog established ones and capture the Brown Line. Conducted properly, the plan would leave the German forces little time to exit the security of their deep dugouts and defend their positions against the infantry advance. If the corps maintained its schedule, the troops would advance as much as and have the majority of the ridge under control by 1:00 pm of the first day.

The experience of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> led the German command to conclude that the policy of rigidly defending a trench position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. Little reconstruction based upon the new <a href="Defence%20in%20depth">defence-in-depth</a> doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.

The <a href="topography">topography</a> of the Vimy battlefield made defence-in-depth difficult to realize. The ridge was wide at its narrowest point, with a steep drop on the eastern side, all but eliminating the possibility of counterattacks if the ridge was captured. The Germans were apprehensive about the inherent weakness of the Vimy Ridge defences. The German defensive scheme was to maintain a front line defence of sufficient strength to defend against an initial assault and move operational reserves forward, before the enemy could consolidate their gains or overrun remaining German positions. As a result, the German defence at Vimy Ridge relied largely on machine guns, which acted as <a href="force%20multiplication">force multipliers</a> for the defending infantry.

Three line divisions, comprising seven infantry regiments were responsible for the immediate defence of the ridge. The paper strength of each division was approximately 15,000 men but their actual strength was significantly fewer. In 1917, a full-strength German rifle company consisted of 264 men; at Vimy Ridge, each rifle company contained approximately 150 men. Each German regiment held a zone approximately wide as far back as the rear area. When the Canadian Corps attacked, each German company faced two or more battalions of approximately 1,000 men each. Reserve divisions were kept about back instead of assembling close behind the second line according to the defence-in-depth theory.

The Canadian Corps' divisional artillery formations, totalling eight field artillery brigades and two heavy artillery groups, were insufficient for the task at hand and were consequently reinforced with outside formations. Four heavy artillery groups, nine field artillery brigades, three divisional artillery groups and the artillery complement of the British 5th Division was attached to the Canadian Corps. In addition, ten heavy artillery groups of the flanking I and XVII Corps were assigned tasks in support of the Canadian Corps. The artillery batteries of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I Corps</a> were particularly important because they enfiladed German gun positions behind Vimy Ridge. In total, the British made available to the Canadian Corps twenty-four brigade artillery groups consisting of four hundred and eighty <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2018%20pounder">18 pounder field guns</a>, one hundred thirty-eight <a href="QF%204.5%20inch%20Howitzer">4.5 inch howitzers</a>, ninety-six <a href="2%20inch%20Medium%20Mortar">2 inch trench mortars</a>, twenty-four <a href="9.45%20inch%20Heavy%20Mortar">9.45 inch mortars</a>, supported by 245 corps-level siege guns and heavy mortars. This firepower gave a density of one heavy gun for every and one field gun for every of Canadian Corps frontage, representing a considerable average increase, including three times the heavy guns, over the distribution of artillery at the Battle of the Somme a year earlier.

<a href="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> <a href="Edward%20Whipple%20Bancroft%20Morrison">Edward Morrison</a> developed and subsequently issued a 35-page multi-phased fire support plan called "Canadian Corps Artillery Instruction No. 1 for the Capture of Vimy Ridge" to support the efforts of the infantry. For its operations, the Canadian Corps received three times the artillery normally assigned to a corps for regular operations. To manage the logistics associated with the increased artillery, Royal Artillery staff officer Major <a href="Alan%20Brooke">Alan Brooke</a> developed coordinated communication and transport plans to work in conjunction with the complex barrage plans.

A 1.6 million shell allotment allowed the artillery along the Canadian Corps front to maintain a high sustained rate of fire. Improvements in the quality of the shells compared to those used earlier in the war ensured fewer <a href="dud">dud</a>s. The introduction of the instantaneous <a href="No.%20106%20fuze">No. 106 fuze</a> greatly improved the effectiveness of the artillery since this fuse burst reliably with the slightest of contact, unlike older timed fuses, making it especially effective at cutting barbed wire before the advance. To maintain communications during the battle, particularly with the artillery, field units laid over of telegraph and <a href="field%20telephone">field telephone</a> cabling, normally at a depth of . In addition, the corps conducted coordinated <a href="counter-battery%20fire">counter-battery</a> initiatives before the battle. The First Army Field Survey Company printed barrage maps for all batteries, produced artillery boards and provided counter-battery support with their flash spotting groups and <a href="sound%20ranging">sound ranging</a> sections. Utilizing flash spotting, sound ranging and aerial reconnaissance from <a href="No.%2016%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 16 Squadron</a> and Balloon Companies of the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) in the week before the battle, the counter battery artillery under command of <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> <a href="Andrew%20McNaughton">Andrew McNaughton</a> fired 125,900 shells, harassing an estimated 83% of the German gun positions.

In February 1917, the British General Staff released a training pamphlet titled "SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action", espousing the return to the pre-war emphasis on <a href="fire%20and%20movement">fire and movement</a> tactics and the use of the <a href="platoon">platoon</a> as the basic tactical unit. The pamphlet noted the importance of specialist hand grenade, rifle grenade, rifle and Lewis gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps implemented the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale models of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.

Recognizing that the men in leadership positions were likely to be wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large <a href="plasticine">plasticine</a> model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. Upwards of 40,000 topographical <a href="trench%20map">trench map</a>s were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. The new measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the <a href="Command%20and%20control%20%28military%29">command and control</a> problems that plagued First World War combat.

Operations along the Vimy Ridge were accompanied by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the <a href="chalk">chalk</a> underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British <a href="tunnelling%20companies%20of%20the%20Royal%20Engineers">tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers</a> took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.

On their arrival, the British began offensive mining against German miners, first stopping the German underground advance and then developing a defensive strategy that prevented the Germans from gaining a tactical advantage by mining. From spring 1916, the British had deployed five tunnelling companies along the Vimy Ridge and during the first two months of their tenure of the area, 70 mines were fired, mostly by the Germans. Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. In May 1916, <a href="The%20German%20Attack%20on%20Vimy%20Ridge%2C%2021%20May%201916">Operation Schleswig-Holstein</a>, a German infantry attack, forced the British back , to stop British mining by capturing the shaft entrances. In the second half of 1916, the British constructed strong defensive underground positions and from August 1916, the Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme for a big infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was postponed. After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of .

The Canadian Corps was posted to the northern part of Vimy Ridge in October 1916 and preparations for an attack were revived in February 1917. British tunnelling companies created extensive underground networks and fortifications. Twelve <a href="Subway%20%28underpass%29">subways</a>, up to long were excavated at a depth of and used to connect reserve lines to front lines, permitting soldiers to advance to the front quickly, securely and unseen. Often incorporated into subways were light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts and communication centres. The Germans dug a number of similar tunnels on the Vimy front, to provide covered routes to the front line and protection for headquarters, resting personnel, equipment, and ammunition. The Germans also conducted <a href="counter-mine">counter-mining</a> against the British tunnellers and destroyed a number of British attempts to plant mines under or near their lines.

Prior to the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the British tunnelling companies also secretly laid 13 mines under German positions to destroy surface fortifications before the assault. To protect some advancing troops from German machine gun fire, as they crossed no man's land during the attack, eight smaller "Wombat" charges were laid at the end of the subways to allow troops to move more quickly and safely enter the German trench system by creating an elongated trench-depth crater that spanned the length of no man's land. At the same time, 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front, each with several large craters. To assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the Canadian Corps visited <a href="La%20Boisselle">La Boisselle</a> and <a href="Fricourt">Fricourt</a> where the <a href="Mines%20on%20the%20first%20day%20of%20the%20Somme">mines</a> had been blown on the <a href="First%20day%20of%20the%20Somme">First day of the Somme</a>. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at <a href="The%20Actions%20of%20St%20Eloi%20Craters">The Actions of St Eloi Craters</a> in April 1916, where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. Further British mines in the area were vetoed following the blowing by the Germans on 23 March 1917 of nine craters along <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> as it was probable that the Germans were aiming to restrict an Allied attack to predictable points. The three mines already laid by <a href="172nd%20Tunnelling%20Company">172nd Tunnelling Company</a> were also dropped from the British plans. The mines were left in place after the assault and were only removed in the 1990s. Another mine, prepared by <a href="176th%20Tunnelling%20Company">176th Tunnelling Company</a> against the German strongpoint known as the Pimple, was not completed in time for the attack. The gallery had been pushed silently through the clay, avoiding the sandy and chalky layers of the Vimy Ridge but by 9 April 1917 was still short of its target. In the end, two mines were blown before the attack, while three mines and two "Wombat" charges were fired to support the attack, including those forming a northern flank.

Trench raiding involved making small-scale surprise attacks on enemy positions, often in the middle of the night for reasons of stealth. All belligerents employed trench raiding as a tactic to harass their enemy and gain <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a>. In the Canadian Corps trench raiding developed into a training and leadership-building mechanism. The size of a raid would normally be anything from a few men to an entire company, or more, depending on the size of the mission. The four months before the April attack saw the Canadian Corps execute no fewer than 55 separate trench raids. Competition between units even developed with units competing for the honour of the greatest number of prisoners captured or most destruction wrought. The policy of aggressive trench raiding was not without its cost. A large-scale trench raid on 13 February 1917, involving 900 men from the <a href="4th%20Canadian%20Division">4th Canadian Division</a>, resulted in 150 casualties. An even more ambitious trench raid, using chlorine gas, on 1 March 1917, once again by the 4th Canadian Division, failed and resulted in 637 casualties including two battalion commanders and a number of company commanders killed. This experience did not lessen the extent to which the Canadian Corps employed trench raiding with raids being conducted nightly between 20 March and the opening of the offensive on 9 April, resulting in approximately 1,400 additional Canadian casualties. The Germans operated an active patrolling policy and although not as large and ambitious as those of the Canadian Corps, they also engaged in trench raiding. As an example, a German trench raid launched by 79 men against the 3rd Canadian Division on 15 March 1917 was successful in capturing prisoners and causing damage.

The RFC launched a determined effort to gain air superiority over the battlefield in support of the spring offensive. The Canadians considered activities such as artillery-observation and photography of opposing trench systems, troop movements and gun emplacements essential to continue their offensive. The Royal Flying Corps deployed 25 squadrons totalling 365 aircraft along the Arras sector, outnumbering the "<a href="Luftstreitkr%C3%A4fte">Luftstreitkräfte</a>" (Imperial German Air Service) by 2-to-1. Byng was given use of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20208%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 8 (Naval) Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%2025%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 25 Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%2040%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 40 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%2043%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 43 Squadron</a>, with No. 16 Squadron permanently attached to the Canadian Corps and employed exclusively for reconnaissance and artillery-observation.

Aerial reconnaissance was often a hazardous task because of the necessity of flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was made more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including the highly experienced and well equipped <a href="Jasta%2011">Jasta 11</a> (<a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>) which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft during the first week of April (<a href="Bloody%20April">Bloody April</a>). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the "Luftstreitkräfte" failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.

German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">6th Army</a> commander General <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Falkenhausen">Ludwig von Falkenhausen</a> was responsible for the Cambrai–Lille sector and commanded 20 divisions, plus reserves. Vimy Ridge itself was principally defended by the ad hoc formation based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander <a href="General%20of%20the%20Infantry%20%28Germany%29">General der Infanterie</a> <a href="Karl%20von%20Fasbender">Karl von Fasbender</a>. However, a division of , under VIII Reserve Corps General of the Infantry Georg Karl Wichura, was involved in the frontline defence along the northernmost portion of the ridge.

Three divisions were ultimately responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps. The <a href="16%20Bavarian%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">16th Bavarian Division</a> was located opposite the village of Souchez and responsible for the defence of the northernmost section of the ridge. The division had been created in January 1917 by amalgamating existing Bavarian formations and had so far only opposed the Canadian Corps. The <a href="79th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">79th Reserve Division</a> was responsible for the defence of the vast central section, including the highest point of the ridge, Hill 145. The 79th Reserve Division had fought for two years on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a> before being transferred to the Vimy sector at the end of February 1917. The <a href="1st%20Bavarian%20Reserve%20Division">1st Bavarian Reserve Division</a> had been in the Arras area since October 1914 and held the villages of Thélus, Bailleul and the southern slope of the ridge.

Byng commanded four attacking divisions, one division in reserve and numerous support units. He was supported to the north by the <a href="24th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">24th Division</a>, I Corps, which advanced north of the Souchez river and by the XVII Corps to the south. The 4th Canadian Division was responsible for the northern portion of the advance that included the capture of the highest point of the ridge, followed by the elaborately fortified Pimple just west of the village of <a href="Givenchy-en-Gohelle">Givenchy-en-Gohelle</a>. The <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Division">3rd Canadian Division</a> was responsible for the narrow central section of the ridge, including the capture of La Folie Farm. The <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Division">2nd Canadian Division</a>, which later included a brigade from the 5th Division, was directly south of 3rd Canadian Division and entrusted with the capture of the village of Thélus. The 1st Canadian Division was responsible for the broad southern sector of the corps advance and expected to cover the longest distance. Byng planned for a healthy reserve for contingencies that included the relief of forward troops, help in consolidating positions and aiding the 4th Canadian Division with the capture of the Pimple. As a result, the 9th Canadian Brigade and the British 15th and 95th Brigades were kept in corps reserve.
Foreign intelligence gathering by the Germans, big Allied trench raids and troop concentrations seen west of Arras, made it clear to the Germans that a spring offensive in the area was being prepared. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them with a great deal of useful information. By March 1917, the 6th Army knew that an offensive was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an <a href="echelon%20formation">echelon formation</a> and were preparing for a big attack. The Germans quickly planned Operation Munich ("Unternehmen München"), a spoiling attack to capture the northern section of the Zouave Valley, along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Munich was not undertaken because the extent of Canadian Corps artillery fire made it impracticable.

The preliminary phase of the Canadian Corps artillery bombardment began on 20 March 1917, with a systematic two-week bombardment of German batteries, trenches and strong points. The Canadian Corps gunners paid particular attention to eliminating German barbed wire, a task made easier with the introduction of the No. 106 instantaneous fuse. Only half of the artillery fired at once and the intensity of the barrage was varied to confuse the Germans about Canadian intentions. Phase two lasted the week beginning 2 April 1917 and employed all of the guns supporting the Canadian Corps, massing the equivalent of a heavy gun for every and a field gun for every . The German soldiers came to refer to the week before the attack as "the week of suffering". In the German account, their trenches and defensive works were almost completely demolished. The health and morale of the German troops suffered from the stress of remaining at the ready for eleven straight days under extremely heavy artillery bombardment. Compounding German difficulties was the inability of ration parties to bring food supplies to the front lines. On 3 April, General von Falkenhausen ordered his reserve divisions to prepare to relieve front line divisions over the course of a long drawn-out defensive battle in a manner similar to the Battle of the Somme and the divisions were kept from the battlefield to avoid being shelled.

The attack was to begin at 5:30 am on <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a>, 9 April 1917. The attack was originally planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed for 24 hours at the request of the French. During the late hours of 8 April and early morning of 9 April the men of the leading and supporting wave of the attack were moved into their forward assembly positions. The weather was cold and later changed to sleet and snow. Although physically discomforting for everyone, the northwesterly storm provided some advantage to the assaulting troops by blowing snow in the faces of the defending troops. Light Canadian and British artillery bombardments continued throughout the night but stopped in the few minutes before the attack, as the artillery recalibrated their guns in preparation for the synchronized barrage. At 5:30 am, every artillery piece at the disposal of the Canadian Corps began firing. Thirty seconds later, engineers detonated the mine charges laid under no man's land and the German trench line, destroying a number of German strong points and creating secure communication trenches directly across no man's land. Light field guns laid down a barrage that mostly advanced at a rate of in three minutes while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages further ahead against known defensive systems. During the early fighting, the German divisional artilleries, despite many losses, were able to maintain their defensive firing. As the Canadian assault advanced, it overran many of the German guns because large numbers of their draught horses had been killed in the initial <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gas attack</a>.
The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions reported reaching and capturing their first objective, the Black Line, by 6:25 am. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. After a planned pause when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions, the advance resumed. Shortly after 7:00 am, the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective, the Red Line and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder. The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the village of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time. A mine explosion that killed many German troops of Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line, preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division. The remaining German troops could do no more than man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line. As a result, the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at the western edge of the Bois de la Folie at around 7:30 am. At 9:00 am the division learned of its exposed left flank, as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145. The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north. Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue orders, even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that German decision cycle was unable to react decisively.
The only portion of the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, collapsing almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer of one of the assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench undamaged. Machine gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down, wounded, or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division's right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions on the top of the ridge. Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill 145 to withdraw, but only after they had run out of ammunition, mortar rounds, and grenades.

Towards midday, the 79th Reserve Division was ordered to recapture the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack. However, it was not until 6:00 pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack, clearing the Canadian Corps troops out of the ruined village of Vimy, but not recapturing the third line south of the village. By night time, the German forces holding the top of the ridge believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the time being. Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by late evening portions of the <a href="111th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">111th Infantry Division</a> occupied the third line near <a href="Acheville">Acheville</a> and <a href="Arleux">Arleux</a>, with the remainder of the division arriving the following day.

The British moved three fresh <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s up to the Red Line by 9:30 am on 10 April to support the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to leapfrog existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00 am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00 pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via <a href="Farbus">Farbus</a> and directed at the rear of the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00 pm.

The 4th Canadian Division had made an attempt to capture the northern half of Hill 145 at around 3:15 pm, briefly capturing the peak before a German counterattack retook the position. The Germans occupying the small salient on the ridge soon found themselves being attacked along their flanks by continuously reinforced Canadian Corps troops. When it became obvious that the position was completely outflanked and there was no prospect of reinforcement, the German troops pulled back. The German forces were evacuated off the ridge with German artillery batteries moved west of the Vimy–Bailleul railway embankment or to the Oppy–Méricourt line. By nightfall of 10 April, the only Canadian objective not yet achieved was the capture of the Pimple.

The 4th Canadian Division faced difficulties at the start of the battle that forced it to delay its assault on the Pimple until 12 April. The Pimple was initially defended by the 16th Bavarian Infantry Division but the Canadian Corps' preliminary artillery bombardment leading up to the assault on 9 April caused heavy casualties amongst its ranks. On 11 April, the <a href="4th%20Guards%20Infantry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">4th Guards Infantry Division</a> first reinforced and then relieved affected 16th Bavarian Infantry Division units. The night before the attack, artillery harassed German positions while a gas section of Royal Engineers, employing <a href="Livens%20Projector">Livens Projector</a>s, fired more than 40 drums of gas directly into the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle to cause confusion. The defending German troops managed to drive back the initial Canadian assaults at around 4:00 am using small arms fire. The 10th Canadian Brigade attacked once again at 5:00 am, this time supported by a significant amount of artillery and the 24th Division of I Corps to the north. The German defensive artillery fire was late and too light to cause the assaulting troops great difficulty, allowing the Canadian Corps to exploit wide gaps and break into the German positions. The 10th Canadian Brigade, assisted by snow and a westerly wind, fought hastily entrained German troops to capture the entire Pimple by 6:00 pm.

By nightfall on 12 April 1917, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German 6th Army suffered an unknown number of casualties with approximately 4,000 men becoming <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. Four members of the Canadian Corps received the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest military decoration awarded to British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces for valour, for their actions during the battle:


At least two Orders <a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>'s highest military order, were awarded to German commanders for their actions during the battle:
Following the defeat, the Chief of the <a href="German%20General%20Staff">German General Staff</a>, <a href="Field%20Marshal%20General">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a>, ordered the "<a href="Oberste%20Heeresleitung">Oberste Heeresleitung</a>" ("OHL", Supreme Army Command) to conduct a court of enquiry into the defensive collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the 6th Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack. The court concluded that 6th Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an <a href="elastic%20defence">elastic defence</a> properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, the defensive system was a series of unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result of the inquiry, Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.

The Germans did not see the Canadian Corps's capture of Vimy Ridge as a loss. Contemporary German sources viewed the action, at worst, as a draw, given that no full-scale breakthrough occurred following the attack. The Germans did not attempt to recapture the ridge, even during the <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> and it remained under British control until the end of the war. The loss of Vimy Ridge forced the Germans to reassess their defensive strategy in the area. Instead of mounting a counterattack, they pursued a <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policy and retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. The complete failure of the French <a href="Nivelle%20Offensive">Nivelle Offensive</a> in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a> to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses. The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arleux">Battle of Arleux</a> and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917.

After the end of World War I, Byng was raised to the <a href="peerage">peerage</a> as "Baron Byng of Vimy", of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex, on 7 October 1919. The next month, he retired from the military.

The Battle of Vimy Ridge has considerable significance for Canada. Although the battle is not generally considered the greatest achievement of the Canadian Corps in strategic importance or results obtained, it was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions, made up of troops drawn from all parts of the country, fought as a cohesive formation. The image of national unity and achievement is what, according to one of many recent patriotic narratives, initially gave the battle importance for Canada. According to Pierce, "The historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation." The idea that Canada's national identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that in the late twentieth century became widely held in military and general histories of Canada. According to McKay and Swift, the theory that Vimy Ridge is a source of Canada's rise as a nation is highly contested and developed in the latter part of the twentieth century after most of those who experienced the Great War had passed away.

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is Canada's largest and principal overseas war memorial. Located on the highest point of the Vimy Ridge, the memorial is dedicated to the commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge and Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War. It serves as the place of commemoration for Canadian soldiers killed in France during the First World War with no known grave. France granted Canada perpetual use of a section of land at Vimy Ridge in 1922 for the purpose of a battlefield park and memorial. A portion of the former battlefield is preserved as part of the memorial park that surrounds the monument. The grounds of the site are still honeycombed with wartime tunnels, trenches, craters and unexploded munitions and are largely closed off for public safety. A section of preserved trenches and a portion of a tunnel have been made accessible to site visitors.

The memorial was designed by Toronto architect and sculptor <a href="Walter%20Seymour%20Allward">Walter Seymour Allward</a>, who described it as a "sermon against the futility of war". The memorial took eleven years and cost $1.5 million ($ million in present terms) to build. The unveiling was conducted on 26 July 1936, by <a href="King%20Edward%20VIII">King Edward VIII</a> accompanied by President <a href="Albert%20Lebrun">Albert Lebrun</a> of France and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including at least 6,200 Canadian veterans and their families. The Canadian Prime Minister <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a> was absent, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance. Edward VIII thanked France, in both English and French, for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead.
A restoration project began in 2004, which included general cleaning and the recarving of many inscribed names. <a href="Queen%20of%20Canada">Queen</a> <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> rededicated the restored monument on 9 April 2007, during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. <a href="Veterans%20Affairs%20Canada">Veterans Affairs Canada</a> maintains the memorial site. The commemoration at the memorial on 9 April 2017 for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge was attended by dignitaries including Canadian Prime Minister <a href="Justin%20Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>, Governor General <a href="David%20Johnston">David Johnston</a>, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William, Duke of Cambridge</a>, <a href="Prince%20Harry">Prince Harry</a> and President of France <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">François Hollande</a>.

Flag of Germany

The flag of Germany or German flag () is a <a href="tricolour%20%28flag%29">tricolour</a> consisting of three equal horizontal bands displaying the <a href="national%20colours%20of%20Germany">national colours</a> of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>: <a href="sable%20%28tincture%29">black</a>, <a href="gules">red</a>, and <a href="or%20%28tincture%29">gold</a> (). The flag was first adopted as the <a href="national%20flag">national flag</a> of modern <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in 1919, during the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, until 1933.

Since the 19th century, Germany has two competing traditions of national colours, black-red-gold and black-white-red. Black-red-gold were the colours of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20German%20states">1848 Revolutions</a>, the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> of 1919-1933 and the Federal Republic (since 1949). They were also adopted by the German Democratic Republic (1949-1990), albeit, since 1959, with an additional ('socialist') coat of arms.

The colours black-white-red appeared for the first time only in 1867, in the constitution of the North German Confederation. This nation state for Prussia and other north and central German states was expanded to the south German states in 1870/1871, under the name <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. It kept these colours until the revolution of 1918/1919. Thereafter, black-white-red became a symbol of the political right, especially the radical right. The national socialists in 1933 re-established these colours along with the party's own swastika flag. After World War II, black-white-red was still used by some conservative groups or by groups of the far right - as it is not forbidden, unlike proper national socialist symbols.

Black-red-gold is the official flag of the Federal Republic of Germany. As an official symbol of the constitutional order, it is protected against defamation. According to §90 of the German penal code, the consequences are a fine or imprisonment up to five years.

The German association with the colours black, red, and gold surfaced in the radical 1840s, when the black-red-gold flag was used to symbolize the movement against the <a href="Conservative%20Order">Conservative European Order</a> that was established after Napoleon's defeat.

There are many theories in circulation regarding the origins of the colour scheme used in the 1848 flag. It has been proposed that the colours were those of the Jena Students' League (), one of the radically minded banned by in the <a href="Carlsbad%20Decrees">Carlsbad Decrees</a>; the colours are mentioned in their canonical order in the seventh verse of <a href="August%20Daniel%20von%20Binzer">August Daniel von Binzer</a>'s student song ("On the Dissolution of the Jena Students' League") quoted by in his "<a href="Academic%20Festival%20Overture">Academic Festival Overture</a>". Another claim goes back to the uniforms (mainly black with red facings and gold buttons) of the Free Corps, comprising mostly university students and formed during the struggle against the occupying forces of Napoleon. Whatever the true explanation, these colours soon came to be regarded as the national colours of Germany during this brief period, and especially after their reintroduction during the <a href="Weimar%20period">Weimar period</a>, they have become synonymous with <a href="social%20liberalism">liberalism</a> in general. The colours also appear in the medieval .

The German <a href="national%20flag">national flag</a> or (), containing only the black-red-gold tricolour, was introduced as part of the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">(West) German constitution</a> in 1949. Following the creation of separate government and military flags in later years, the plain tricolour is now used as the German <a href="civil%20flag">civil flag</a> and <a href="civil%20ensign">civil ensign</a>. This flag is also used by non-federal authorities to show their connection to the federal government, e.g. the authorities of the <a href="States%20of%20Germany">German states</a> use the German national flag together with <a href="Flags%20of%20German%20states">their own flag</a>.

The <a href="government%20flag">government flag</a> of Germany is officially known as the (state flag of the federal authorities) or for short. Introduced in 1950, the government flag is the civil flag <a href="defacement%20%28flag%29">defaced</a> with the ("Federal Shield"), which overlaps with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. The is a variant of the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Germany">coat of arms of Germany</a>, whose main differences are the illustration of the eagle and the shape of the shield: the is rounded at the base, whereas the standard coat of arms is pointed. The government flag may only be used by federal government authorities and its use by others is an offence, punishable with a fine. However, public use of flags similar to the (e.g. using the actual coat of arms instead of the ) is tolerated, and such flags are sometimes seen at international sporting events.

In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings in Germany use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; many town flags in Germany exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified. In 1996, a layout for the vertical version of the government flag was established, that co-incidentally matched the pattern of the "conventional" black-red-gold flag of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Gera">Principality of Reuss-Gera</a> () from 1806–1918: the is displayed in the centre of the flag, overlapping with up to one fifth of the black and gold bands. When hung like a banner or draped, the black band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the black band must face the staff.

Since the German armed forces () are a federal authority, the is also used as the German <a href="war%20flag">war flag</a> on land. In 1956, the (Flag of the <a href="German%20Navy">German Navy</a>) was introduced: the government flag ending in <a href="swallowtail%20%28flag%29">swallowtail</a>. This naval flag is also used as a <a href="Maritime%20flag%23Jacks">navy jack</a>.
Article 22 of the German constitution, the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany</a>, states:

The federal flag shall be black, red and gold.

Following specifications set by the (West) German government in 1950, the flag displays three bars of equal width and has a width–length ratio of 3:5; the tricolour used during the Weimar Republic had a ratio of 2:3.

At the time of the adoption of the flag there were no exact colour specifications other than ""Black-Red-Gold"". However on 2 June 1999, the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Germany">federal cabinet</a> introduced a <a href="corporate%20design">corporate design</a> for the German government which defined the specifications of the official colors as:
<nowiki>*</nowiki>

<a href="Vexillology">Vexillology</a> rarely distinguishes between gold and yellow; in <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, they are both "<a href="Or%20%28heraldry%29">Or</a>". For the German flag, such a distinction is made: the colour used in the flag is gold, not yellow.

When the black–red–gold tricolour was adopted by the Weimar Republic as its flag, it was attacked by <a href="conservatism">conservatives</a>, <a href="monarchism">monarchists</a>, and the <a href="far%20right">far right</a>, who referred to the colours with spiteful nicknames such as (black–red–yellow) or even (black–red–mustard). When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the black–white–red colours of pre-1918 Imperial Germany were swiftly reintroduced, and their propaganda machine continued to discredit the , using the same derogatory terms as previously used by the monarchists.

On 16 November 1959, the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20Germany">Federal Court of Justice</a> () stated that the usage of "black–red–yellow" and the like had "through years of Nazi agitation, attained the significance of a malicious slander against the democratic symbols of the state" and was now an offence. As summarised by heraldist Arnold Rabbow in 1968, "the German colours are black–red–yellow but they are called black–red–gold."

Following federal <a href="decree">decree</a> on 22 March 2005, the flag must be flown from public buildings on the following dates. Not all of these days are public holidays.

Election days for the <a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a> and the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> are also flag days in some states, in addition to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">president</a> or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the <a href="Federal%20Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Germany%29">Federal Ministry of the Interior</a>. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

The <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> (800/962 – 1806, known as the "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" after 1512) did not have a national flag, but black and gold were used as colours of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> and featured in the imperial banner: a black eagle on a golden background. After the late 13th or early 14th century, the claws and beak of the eagle were coloured red. From the early 15th century, a <a href="double-headed%20eagle">double-headed eagle</a> was used.

When <a href="Heinrich%20XI%2C%20Prince%20Reuss%20of%20Greiz">Heinrich XI, Prince Reuss of Greiz</a> was appointed by <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor</a> to rule the then-new <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Greiz">Principality of Reuss-Greiz</a> on 12 May 1778, the flag adopted by the "Fürstentum Reuß-Greiz" was the first-ever appearance of the black-red-gold tricolour in its modern arrangement in any <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> <a href="Thuringia">within what today</a> comprises Germany – the Reuss elder line that ruled the principality used a flag whose proportions were close to a "nearly square"-shape 4:5 <a href="Glossary%20of%20vexillology%23Flag%20elements">hoist/fly</a> ratio, instead of the modern German flag's 3:5 figure. 

In 1804, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> declared the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>. In response to this, Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II</a> of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg dynasty</a> declared his personal domain to be the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> and became Francis I of Austria. Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, the flag of the Austrian Empire was black and gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the <a href="flag%20of%20Austria">flag of Austria</a> until 1918.
The colours red and white were also significant during this period. When the Holy Roman Empire took part in the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>, a <a href="war%20flag">war flag</a> was flown alongside the black-gold imperial banner. This flag, known as the "Saint George Flag", was a white cross on a red background: the reverse of the <a href="St%20George%27s%20Cross">St George's Cross</a> used as the <a href="flag%20of%20England">flag of England</a>, and similar to the <a href="flag%20of%20Denmark">flag of Denmark</a>. Red and white were also colours of the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic League</a> (13th–17th century). Hanseatic trading ships were identifiable by their red-white pennants, and most Hanseatic cities adopted red and white as their city colours (see <a href="Hanseatic%20flags">Hanseatic flags</a>). Red and white still feature as the colours of many former Hanseatic cities such as <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> or <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a>.

In <a href="northern%20Italy">northern Italy</a>, during the <a href="Guelph%20and%20Ghibelline">Guelph and Ghibelline</a> conflict of the 12th–14th century, the armies of the Ghibelline (pro-imperial) communes adopted the war banner of the Holy Roman Emperor (white cross on red) as their own, while the Guelf (anti-imperial) communes reversed the colours (red cross on white). These two schemes are prevalent in the modern civic heraldry of northern Italian towns and remains a revealing indicator of their past factional leanings. Traditionally Ghibelline towns like <a href="Pavia">Pavia</a>, <a href="Novara">Novara</a>, <a href="Como">Como</a>, and <a href="Asti">Asti</a> continue to sport the Ghibelline cross. The Guelf cross can be found on the civic arms of traditionally Guelf towns like <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="Vercelli">Vercelli</a>, <a href="Alessandria">Alessandria</a>, <a href="Reggio%20Emilia">Reggio</a>, and <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>.

With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, many of its dukes and princes joined the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine">Confederation of the Rhine</a>, a confederation of Napoleonic client states. These states preferred to use their own flags. The confederation had no flag of its own; instead it used the blue-white-red <a href="flag%20of%20France">flag of France</a> and the Imperial Standard of its protector, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>.

During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the German struggle against the occupying French forces was significantly symbolised by the colours of black, red, and gold, which became popular after their use in the uniforms of the <a href="L%C3%BCtzow%20Free%20Corps">Lützow Free Corps</a>, a volunteer unit of the <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian Army</a>. This unit had uniforms in black with red facings and gold buttons. The colour choice had pragmatic origins, even though black-red-gold were the former colours used by the Holy Roman Empire. Members of the corps were required to supply their own clothing: in order to present a uniform appearance it was easiest to dye all clothes black. Gold-coloured buttons were widely available, and <a href="pennon">pennon</a>s used by the <a href="lancer">lancer</a>s in the unit were red and black. At the time, the colours represented:

As the members of this unit came from all over Germany and were mostly university students and academics, the Lützow Free Corps and their colours gained considerable exposure among the German people.

The 1815–16 <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> led to the creation of the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a>, a loose union of all remaining German states after the Napoleonic Wars. The Confederation was created as a replacement for the now-extinct Holy Roman Empire, with <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis I of Austria</a>—the last Holy Roman Emperor—as its president. The confederation did not have a flag of its own, although the black-red-gold tricolour is sometimes mistakenly attributed to it.
Upon returning from the war, veterans of the Lützow Free Corps founded the fraternity in <a href="Jena">Jena</a> in June 1815. The Jena eventually adopted a flag with three equal horizontal bands of red, black, and red, with gold trim and a golden oak branch across the black band, following the colours of the uniforms of the Free Corps. Since the students who served in the Lützow Free Corps came from various German states, the idea of a unified German state began to gain momentum within the and similar that were subsequently formed throughout the Confederation. On 18 October 1817, the fourth anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a>, hundreds of fraternity members and academics from across the Confederation states met in <a href="Wartburg">Wartburg</a> in <a href="Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</a> (in modern <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>), calling for a free and unified German nation.

The gold-red-black flag of the Jena featured prominently at this <a href="Wartburg%20festival">Wartburg festival</a>. Therefore, the colours black, red, and gold eventually became symbolic of this desire for a unified German state. The Ministerial Council of the German Confederation, in its determination to maintain the status quo, enacted the <a href="Carlsbad%20Decrees">Carlsbad Decrees</a> of 1819 that banned all student organisations, officially putting an end to the .
In May 1832, around 30,000 people demonstrated at the <a href="Hambach%20Festival">Hambach Festival</a> for freedom, unity, and civil rights. The colours black, red, and gold had become a well established symbol for the liberal, democratic and republican movement within the German states since the Wartburg Festival, and flags in these colours were flown en masse at the Hambach Festival. While contemporary illustrations showed prominent use of a gold-red-black tricolour (an upside-down version of the modern German flag), surviving flags from the event were in black-red-gold. Such an example is the , the flag flown from <a href="Hambach%20Castle">Hambach Castle</a> during the festival: a black-red-gold tricolour where the red band contains the inscription (Germany's rebirth). This flag is now on permanent display at the castle.

In the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20German%20states">Springtime of the Peoples</a> during the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">Revolutions of 1848</a>, revolutionaries took to the streets, many flying the tricolour. Liberals took power and, after prolonged deliberation, a national assembly was formulated. This <a href="Frankfurt%20Parliament">Frankfurt Parliament</a> declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.

In 1850, the Frankfurt Parliament collapsed, and the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> was restored under Austrian presidency, who suppressed the actions of the failed Frankfurt Parliament, including the tricolour. Afterwards, the most pressing issue was whether or not to include Austria in any future German nation, as Austria's status as a multi-ethnic empire complicated the dream of a united Greater Germany—the solution. Alternatively, there was the (Lesser German) solution for a Germany that encompassed only German lands and excluded Austria. The Prussian–Austrian duality within the Confederation eventually led to the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> in 1866. During the war, the southern states allied with Austria adopted the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, and the 8th German Army Corps also wore black-red-gold armbands. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a> and its predominately north German allies defeated Austria and made way for the realisation of the Lesser German solution a few years later.

Following the dissolution of the German Confederation, Prussia formed its unofficial successor, the <a href="North%20German%20Confederation">North German Confederation</a>, in 1866 with the signing of the <a href="North%20German%20Confederation%20Treaty">Confederation Treaty</a> in August 1866 and then the ratification of the <a href="North%20German%20Constitution">Constitution of 1867</a>. This national state consisted of Prussia, the largest member state, and 21 other north German states.
The question regarding what flag should be adopted by the new confederation was first raised by the shipping sector and its desire to have an internationally recognisable identity. Virtually all international shipping that belonged to the confederation originated from either Prussia or the three Hanseatic city-states of <a href="Bremen%20%28state%29">Bremen</a>, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, and <a href="Free%20City%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>. Based on this, Adolf Soetbeer, secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, suggested in the on 22 September 1866 that any planned flag should combine the <a href="Flag%20of%20Prussia">colours of Prussia</a> (black and white) with the <a href="Hanseatic%20flags">Hanseatic colours</a> (red and white). In the following year, the <a href="North%20German%20Constitution">constitution of the North German Confederation</a> was enacted, where a horizontal black-white-red tricolour was declared to be both the civil and war ensign.

King <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm I of Prussia</a> was satisfied with the colour choice: the red and white were also taken to represent the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a>, the <a href="Prince-elector">Imperial elector state</a> that was a predecessor of the Kingdom of Prussia. The absence of gold from the flag also made it clear that this German state did not include the "black and gold" monarchy of Austria. In the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, the remaining southern German states allied with the North German Confederation, leading to the <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a>. A new constitution of 1871 gave the federal state the new name of German Empire and the Prussian king the title of Emperor. The <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> retained black, white, and red as its national colours. An ordinance of 1892 dealt with the official use of the colours.

The black-white-red tricolour remained the flag of Germany until the end of the German Empire in 1918, in the final days of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Following the declaration of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">revolutionary period</a>, the so-called <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the <a href="Weimar%20Constitution">Weimar Constitution</a> in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Greiz">Reuss-Greiz</a> - where the use and layout of the "schwarz-rot-gold" design had originated some 140 years earlier - <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Gera">Reuss-Gera</a>, and <a href="Principality%20of%20Waldeck-Pyrmont">Waldeck-Pyrmont</a> and <a href="Free%20State%20of%20Waldeck-Pyrmont">its republican successor</a> had upheld the 1778-established tradition, and had always continued to use the German colours of <a href="Sable%20%28heraldry%29">black</a>, <a href="Gules">red</a>, and <a href="Or%20%28heraldry%29">or</a> (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.
This change was not welcomed by many people in Germany, who saw this new flag as a symbol of humiliation following Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names ("see <a href="%23Colour">Colour</a> above"). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.

The symbols of Imperial Germany became symbols of monarchist and nationalist protest and were often used by monarchist and nationalist organisations (e.g. <a href="Stahlhelm%2C%20Bund%20der%20Frontsoldaten">Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten</a>). This included the (war flag of the Reich), which has been revived in the present for similar use. Many nationalist political parties during the Weimar period—such as the <a href="German%20National%20People%27s%20Party">German National People's Party</a> (see poster) and the <a href="Nazi%20Party">National Socialist German Workers Party</a> (Nazi Party)—used the imperial colours, a practice that has continued today with the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">National Democratic Party of Germany</a>.

On 24 February 1924, the organisation was founded in <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> by the member parties of the <a href="Weimar%20Coalition">Weimar Coalition</a> (<a href="Centre%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Centre</a>, <a href="German%20Democratic%20Party">DDP</a>, <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a>) and the <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s. This organisation was formed to protect the fragile democracy of the Weimar Republic, which was under constant pressure by both the far right and far left. Through this organisation, the black-red-gold flag became not only a symbol of German democracy, but also of resistance to political extremism. This was summarised by the organisation's first chairman, <a href="Otto%20H%C3%B6rsing">Otto Hörsing</a>, who described their task as a "struggle against the <a href="swastika">swastika</a> and the <a href="Red%20star">Soviet star</a>".

In the face of the increasingly violent conflicts between the communists and Nazis, the growing polarisation of the German population and a multitude of other factors, mainly the drastic economic sinking, extreme hyperinflation and corruption of the republic, the Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 with the Nazi seizure of power () and the appointment of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%28German%20Reich%29">German chancellor</a>.

After the Nazi Party came to power on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a ruling on 12 March established two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and the flag of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>.

On 15 September 1935, one year after the death of <a href="President%20of%20Germany%20%28Weimar%20Republic%29">Reich President</a> <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a> and Hitler's elevation to the position of <a href="F%C3%BChrer">Führer</a>, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the "<a href="SS%20Bremen%20%281928%29">"Bremen"</a> incident" of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS "Bremen", tore the Nazi Party flag from the <a href="jackstaff">jackstaff</a>, and tossed it into the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a bygone era and under threat of being used by "reactionaries".

The design of the Nazi flag was introduced by Hitler as the party flag in mid-1920, roughly a year before (29 July 1921) he became his political party's leader: a flag with a red background, a white disk and a black <a href="swastika">swastika</a> "(Hakenkreuz)" in the middle. In "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>", Hitler explained the process by which the Nazi flag design was created: It was necessary to use the same colours as Imperial Germany, because in Hitler's opinion they were "revered colours expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation." The most important requirement was that "the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." Nazi propaganda clarified the symbolism of the flag: the red colour stood for the social, white for the movement's national thinking and the swastika for the victory of the Aryan peoples over Jewry. Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design. <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a> stated in his memoirs that "in only two other designs did he (Adolf Hitler) execute the same care as he did his <a href="Berghof%20%28residence%29">Obersalzberg house</a>: that of the <a href="Reichskriegsflagge">Reich War Flag</a> and his own <a href="Personal%20standard%20of%20Adolf%20Hitler">standard of Chief of State</a>".

An off-centred disk version of the swastika flag was used as the civil ensign on German-registered civilian ships and was used as the jack on (the name of the <a href="German%20Navy">German Navy</a>, 1933–1945) warships. The flags for use on sea had a <a href="through%20and%20through">through and through</a> image, so the "left-facing" and "right-facing" version were each present on one side while the national flag was right-facing on both sides.

From 1933 to at least 1938, the Nazis sometimes "sanctified" swastika flags by touching them with the (blood flag), the swastika flag used by Nazi paramilitaries during the failed <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a> in 1923. This ceremony took place at every <a href="Nuremberg%20Rally">Nuremberg Rally</a>. It is unknown whether this tradition was continued after the last Nuremberg rally in 1938.

At the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the first law enacted by the <a href="Allied%20Control%20Council">Allied Control Council</a> abolished all Nazi symbols and repealed all relevant laws. The possession of swastika flags is <a href="Swastika%23Post%E2%80%93World%20War%20II%20stigmatization">forbidden in several countries</a> since then, with the importation or display of them forbidden <a href="Strafgesetzbuch%20section%2086a">particularly in Germany</a>.

After the defeat of Germany in World War II, the country was <a href="Allied-administered%20Germany">placed under Allied administration</a>. Although there was neither a national German government nor a German flag, German ships were required by international law to have a national ensign of some kind. As a provisional civil ensign of Germany, the <a href="Allied%20Control%20Council">Council</a> designated the <a href="International%20maritime%20signal%20flags">international signal pennant Charlie</a> representing the letter C ending in a <a href="swallowtail%20%28flag%29">swallowtail</a>, known as the C-Pennant (). The Council ruled that "no ceremony shall be accorded this flag which shall not be <a href="Flag%20dipping">dipped</a> in salute to warships or merchant ships of any nationality". Similarly, the <a href="Flag%20of%20Japan%23U.S.%20Occupation">Japanese civil ensign</a> used immediately following World War II was the signal pennant for the letter E ending in a swallowtail, and the <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20Administration%20of%20the%20Ryukyu%20Islands%23Flag">Ryūkyūan civil ensign</a> was a swallowtailed letter D signal pennant.

West of the <a href="Oder%E2%80%93Neisse%20line">Oder–Neisse line</a>, the German states were reorganised along the lines of the <a href="Allied%20Occupation%20Zones%20in%20Germany">zones of occupation</a>, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the northern halves of the former states of <a href="Free%20People%27s%20State%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Baden">Baden</a> were merged to form <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg-Baden">Württemberg-Baden</a> in 1946. As its flag, Württemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to Württemberg's colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden's colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could be mistaken for a combination of the two flags. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, whose flag is black and gold.

Two other states that were created after the war, <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a> (French zone) and <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts of other states, and no colour combinations from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led to the use of the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly to any one of the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.

With relations deteriorating between the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the three western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation and allow the formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>.
During the preparation of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at <a href="Herrenchiemsee">Herrenchiemsee</a>. Although there were objections to the creation of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.

While there were other suggestions for the new flag for West Germany, the final choice was between two designs, both using black-red-gold. The <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats</a> proposed the re-introduction of the old Weimar flag, while the conservative parties such as the <a href="Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20%28Germany%29">CDU</a>/<a href="Christian%20Social%20Union%20of%20Bavaria">CSU</a> and the <a href="German%20Party%20%281947%29">German Party</a> proposed a suggestion by Ernst Wirmer, a member of the (parliamentary council) and future advisor of chancellor <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a>. Wirmer suggested a variant of the 1944 "Resistance" flag (using the black-red-gold scheme in a <a href="Nordic%20Cross%20flag">Nordic Cross</a> pattern) designed by his brother and <a href="July%2020%20Plot">20 July</a> co-conspirator Josef. The tricolour was ultimately selected, largely to illustrate the continuity between the Weimar Republic and this new German state. With the enactment of the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">(West) German constitution</a> on 23 May 1949, the black-red-gold tricolour was readopted as the flag for the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1955, the inhabitants of the French-administered <a href="Saar%20Protectorate">Saar Protectorate</a> voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a <a href="Flag%20of%20Saarland">white Nordic cross on a blue and red background</a> as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar to be a part of West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Saarland">coat of arms</a>, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a> as a state of West Germany.

While the use of black-red-gold had been suggested in the Soviet zone in 1946, the Second People's Congress in 1948 decided to adopt the old black-white-red tricolour as a national flag for East Germany. This choice was based on the use of these colours by the <a href="National%20Committee%20for%20a%20Free%20Germany">National Committee for a Free Germany</a>, a German anti-<a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> organisation that operated in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the last two years of the war. In 1949, following a suggestion from <a href="Friedrich%20Ebert%2C%20Jr.">Friedrich Ebert, Jr.</a>, the black-red-gold tricolour was instead selected as the flag of the German Democratic Republic upon the formation of this state on 7 October 1949. From 1949 to 1959, the flags of both West and East Germany were identical. On 1 October 1959, the East German government changed its flag with the addition of <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20East%20Germany">its coat of arms</a>. In West Germany, these changes were seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the two Germanys. Displaying this flag in West Germany and West Berlin—where it became known as the (divider-flag)—was seen as a breach of the constitution and subsequently banned until the late 1960s.

From 1956 to 1964, West and East Germany attended the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter</a> and <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> as a single team, known as the <a href="United%20Team%20of%20Germany">United Team of Germany</a>. After the East German national flag was changed in 1959, neither country accepted the flag of the other. As a compromise, a new flag was used by the United Team of Germany from 1960 to 1964, featuring the black-red-gold tricolour <a href="Defacement%20%28flag%29">defaced</a> with white <a href="Olympic%20rings">Olympic rings</a> in the red stripe. In 1968 the teams from the two German states entered separately, but both used the same German Olympic flag. From 1972 to 1988, the separate West and East German teams used their respective national flags.

After the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarians had done in 1956</a> and as <a href="Romanian%20people">Romanians</a> would soon do during the <a href="Romanian%20Revolution%20of%201989">fall of Ceaușescu</a>. The widespread act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a <a href="German%20reunification">reunified Germany</a>. In 1998, the <a href="Bundesstiftung%20zur%20Aufarbeitung%20der%20SED-Diktatur">Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship</a> was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.

The old black-white-red tricolour of the German Empire is still used by <a href="monarchist">monarchist</a>s and those members of German royalty who long for the peaceful reintroduction of a German democratic monarchy. This use of the old flag is almost completely overshadowed by its prevalent use by the far right; since the aforementioned ban on all <a href="Nazi%20symbolism">Nazi symbolism</a> ("<a href="Hakenkreuz">Hakenkreuz</a>", the "Schutzstaffel's" double <a href="sig%20rune">sig rune</a>, etc.) is still in effect within today's Germany, the far right have been forced to forego any Nazi flags and instead use the old imperial flag, which the Nazis themselves banned in 1935.

In Germany, the use of the flag and other national symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against nationalistic furor in general, esp. the one of the Nazis. During the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. This explosion in the flag's occurrence in day-to-day life was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension. In 2008, it seemed that the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed by the end of the tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.
Until winning the soccer world cup in 2014, usage of the German flag increased periodically.
As many Germans regarded showing the own flag as part of their support for the own team in the tournament, most flags disappeared after the end of a tournament, sometimes due to government decisions. In the period that followed, the display of German flag colours, even outside stadiums, was regularly limited to the period of major sporting events.
With the rise of nationalist currents (<a href="Pegida">Pegida</a>, <a href="Alternative%20for%20Germany">AfD</a>, etc.) and their showing of the German flag as a symbol of their nationalism, the flag again became more widespread in everyday life. Mainstream society remains hesitant to use the colours, though.

Viking metal

Viking metal is a style of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a> characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <a href="Norse%20religion">Norse paganism</a>, and the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> with influences from <a href="Nordic%20folk%20music">Nordic folk music</a>. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy <a href="Ostinato%23Riff">riffing</a> style, <a href="anthem">anthem</a>ic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on <a href="folk%20instrument">folk instrument</a>ation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.

Viking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an <a href="Anti-Christian%20sentiment%23Europe">opposition to Christianity</a>, but rejecting <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a> and <a href="occult">occult themes</a> in favor of the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> and <a href="Heathenry%20%28new%20religious%20movement%29">paganism</a>. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to <a href="pagan%20metal">pagan metal</a>, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a>, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and <a href="folk%20metal">folk metal</a> genres as part of broader <a href="modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> and <a href="neo-v%C3%B6lkisch%20movements">neo-"völkisch" movements</a> as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.

Though artists such as <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Yngwie%20Malmsteen">Yngwie Malmsteen</a>, <a href="Heavy%20Load%20%28band%29">Heavy Load</a>, and <a href="Manowar">Manowar</a> had previously dealt with Viking themes, <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a> from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums "<a href="Blood%20Fire%20Death">Blood Fire Death</a>" (1988) and "<a href="Hammerheart">Hammerheart</a>" (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. <a href="Enslaved%20%28band%29">Enslaved</a>, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with "<a href="Hordanes%20Land">Hordanes Land</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Vikingligr%20Veldi">Vikingligr Veldi</a>" (1994). <a href="Burzum">Burzum</a>, <a href="Emperor%20%28band%29">Emperor</a>, <a href="Einherjer">Einherjer</a>, and <a href="Helheim%20%28band%29">Helheim</a>, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band <a href="Falkenbach">Falkenbach</a>, Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> heritage, and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> bands <a href="Unleashed%20%28band%29">Unleashed</a>, <a href="Amon%20Amarth">Amon Amarth</a> and <a href="Ensiferum">Ensiferum</a>, which emerged in the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.

Viking metal features the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> as its subject matter and for evocative imagery. The Vikings were <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a>an seafarers and adventurers who, during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, relied on sailing vessels such as <a href="longship">longship</a>s, "<a href="knarr">knerrir</a>", and "<a href="karve%20%28ship%29">karvi</a>" to explore, raid, pirate, trade, and settle along the <a href="Borders%20of%20the%20oceans%23Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic</a>, <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>, <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, and <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> coasts and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>an river systems. The <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> is generally cited as beginning in 793, when a Viking raid struck <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, and concluding in 1066, with the death of <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> and the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>. During this two-hundred-year period, the <a href="Viking%20expansion">Vikings ventured</a> west as far as <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> in the North Atlantic and <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and what is now <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, south as far as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Nekor">Kingdom of Nekor</a> (Morocco), <a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italy</a>, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, and <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in the Mediterranean, and southeast as far as what are now <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> in Eastern Europe, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a> in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>.

The Vikings originated from the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a> and the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a>, and consisted mostly of <a href="North%20Germanic%20peoples">Scandinavians</a>, though <a href="Finns">Finns</a>, <a href="Estonians">Estonians</a>, <a href="Curonians">Curonians</a>, and <a href="Sami%20people">Sami people</a> went on voyages as well. While otherwise disparate peoples, they shared some commonalities in that they were not considered "civilized" and were not, at first, adherents to Christianity, instead following their indigenous <a href="Nordic%20religion">Nordic</a> and <a href="Finnic%20mythologies">Finnic</a> religions. However, they often adopted Christianity upon settling in an area, intermixing the faith with their own <a href="paganism">pagan</a> traditions, and by the end of the Viking Age, all <a href="Christianization%20of%20Scandinavia">Scandinavian kingdoms were Christianized</a> and what remained of Viking cultures were absorbed into <a href="Christianity%20in%20Europe">Christian Europe</a>.

Nordic folk music encompasses traditions from <a href="Music%20of%20Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Iceland">Iceland</a> and the dependent countries <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, and <a href="Music%20of%20Greenland">Greenland</a>, and nearby regions. Specific instruments vary between countries and regions, but some common instruments include the <a href="lur">lur</a>, <a href="s%C3%A4ckpipa">säckpipa</a>, <a href="Hardanger%20fiddle">Hardanger fiddle</a>, <a href="nyckelharpa">keyed fiddle</a>, <a href="willow%20flute">willow flute</a>, <a href="harp">harp</a>, <a href="Jew%27s%20harp">mouth harp</a>, and <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">animal horns</a>. Common genres in Nordic folk include <a href="ballad">ballad</a>s, <a href="herding">herding</a> music, and <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>, genres which trace back to the medieval era. Often, Nordic melodies will contain the <a href="phrase%20%28music%20theory%29">phrase</a> C-B-G.

In <a href="Swedish%20folk%20music">Swedish folk music</a>, songs are <a href="monophonic">monophonic</a>, unemotional, and solemn in character, though working and festive songs might be more lively and rhythmic. <a href="Danish%20traditional%20music">Danish</a> songs melodies tend to lean toward the <a href="major%20and%20minor">major</a>. In <a href="Icelandic%20folk%20music">Icelandic folk music</a>, the "<a href="r%C3%ADmur">rímur</a>", a form of epic poem dating back to the medieval era and Viking Age, is prominent. Faroese music contains dances directly descended from medieval ballad and epic poems, particularly from literature in the Icelandic tradition, and often follows unusual <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s. Many <a href="Music%20of%20Norway%23Traditional%20%28Folk%29%20music">Norwegian folk</a> ballads follow a four-<a href="stanza">stanza</a> structure known as <a href="stev">stev</a>. Stev alternate a <a href="trochaic%20tetrameter">trochaic tetrameter</a> with a <a href="trimeter">trimeter</a>, and lines typically rhyme following an <a href="simple%204-line">ABCB scheme</a>, though stev are not standardized. <a href="Music%20of%20Finland%23Folk%20music">Finnish folk music</a> tends to be based on <a href="Karelians">Karelian</a> traditions and the meter and thematic material found in the "<a href="Kalevala">Kalevala</a>". These themes include magic, mysticism, <a href="shamanism">shamanism</a>, Viking sea voyages, Christian legends, and ballads and dance songs. The older "runo" song tradition follows meters such as , , or . Under Swedish and German influence, a newer, round-dance tradition based on the "runo" emerged – the "<a href="rekilaulu">rekilaulu</a>" – and these usually follow a or time. <a href="Sami%20music">Sami music</a> traditions (music from the Sami people throughout <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a>) historically were rather insular, exerting little influence on the music surrounding cultures. Sami music is known for <a href="joik">joik</a>ing, improvised singing particular to the performer. These songs are often sung accompanied by a drum.

Black metal is an <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme</a> subgenre of heavy metal music that, mostly in Europe, emerged from <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a> and <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> in the 1980s. A "first wave" began in the early to mid-1980s, through the work of bands such as <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>, <a href="Hellhammer">Hellhammer</a>, <a href="Celtic%20Frost">Celtic Frost</a>, <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a>, and <a href="Bathory%20%28band%29">Bathory</a>. The name black metal is taken from the 1982 <a href="Black%20Metal%20%28album%29">album of the same name</a> by Venom, while Bathory's 1984 <a href="Bathory%20%28album%29">self-titled release</a> is generally regarded as the first true black metal record. A "second wave" developed in part as a reaction to the burgeoning <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> genre, and in part inspired by the <a href="Teutonic%20thrash%20metal">Teutonic thrash metal</a> scene. It was headed by the <a href="early%20Norwegian%20black%20metal%20scene">early Norwegian black metal scene</a>, through artists such as <a href="Mayhem%20%28band%29">Mayhem</a>, <a href="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>, <a href="Burzum">Burzum</a>, <a href="Immortal%20%28band%29">Immortal</a>, <a href="Emperor%20%28band%29">Emperor</a>, <a href="Satyricon%20%28band%29">Satyricon</a>, <a href="Thorns%20%28band%29">Thorns</a>, <a href="Ulver">Ulver</a>, and <a href="Gorgoroth%20%28band%29">Gorgoroth</a>. The early Norwegian scene became infamous for murders, assaults, and numerous <a href="Black%20metal%23Church%20burnings">church arsons</a> committed by members of the scene. Black metal lyrical themes are focused on <a href="Satan">Satan</a> and <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>, which many first-wave bands used with a tongue-in-cheek approach, contrary to the more serious beliefs and vehement <a href="anti-Christian%20sentiment">anti-Christian sentiment</a> of many second-wave bands.

Musically, the first wave of bands were just considered to be playing heavier forms of metal – Venom was part of the <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a>, Celtic Frost was variously described as thrash metal or death metal, and <a href="Quorthon">Quorthon</a> of Bathory simply labeled his music "heavy metal". It was not until the second wave that black metal was more clearly defined. A key development during that period was a guitar playing style featuring fast, un-<a href="palm%20mute">muted</a> <a href="tremolo%20picking">tremolo picking</a> or "buzz picking", introduced by <a href="Euronymous">Euronymous</a> of Mayhem and Snorre Ruch ("Blackthorn") of Thorns. Other common traits for guitar playing include a high-pitched or <a href="treble%20%28sound%29">treble</a> guitar tone and heavy <a href="distortion%20%28guitar%29">distortion</a>. <a href="Guitar%20solo">Solos</a> and <a href="guitar%20tuning%23dropped%20tunings">dropped tunings</a> are rare. Overall, the guitar sound tends to be "thin and brittle" compared to other heavy metal genres, with the idea of "heaviness" conveyed through harshness and <a href="timbre">timbral</a> density rather than low frequency. The <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> tends to be buried under the guitar tones, even non-existent. Drums and even vocals are likewise often mixed low, with these production techniques resulting in a blurred "wash" of sound. Vocals are usually high-pitched and raspy shrieks, screams, and snarls, and rarely <a href="guttural">guttural</a>s and <a href="death%20growl">death growl</a>s are also employed. The use of keyboards is also frequent.

The influence of Scandinavian folk music within Norwegian black metal is apparent in the use by some guitarists belonging to that scene of <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drones</a> and <a href="mode%20%28music%29">modal</a> melodies reminiscent of the folk tradition. <a href="Terje%20Bakken">Terje Bakken</a> of <a href="Windir">Windir</a> explained that ancient Nordic folk is easily integrated into metal idiom due to the "sad atmosphere" the two genres have in common. Production values within black metal are often raw and <a href="lo-fidelity">lo-fidelity</a>. Originally, this was merely because many early second-wave bands lacked the resources to record properly, but the practice was continued by successful bands in order to identify with their genre's underground origins. Though featuring these common traits, black metal spawned diverse musical approaches and subgenres, with some bands taking more experimental and <a href="avant-garde%20music">avant-garde</a> directions. Other bands, such as <a href="Cradle%20of%20Filth">Cradle of Filth</a> and <a href="Dimmu%20Borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a>, embraced a more commercial sound and production aesthetic instead.

The use of Viking themes and imagery in <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> and <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a> predates the advent of Viking metal. For instance, the lyrics to <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="Immigrant%20Song">Immigrant Song</a>" (1970) and "<a href="No%20Quarter%20%28song%29">No Quarter</a>" (1973) feature allusions to Viking voyages, violence, and exploration. The Swedish band <a href="Heavy%20Load%20%28band%29">Heavy Load</a> often wrote Viking-themed songs, such as the 1978 song "Son of the Northern Light", and Eduardo Rivadavia of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> claims that the 1983 song "Stronger than Evil" establishes a case for Heavy Load as the first Viking metal group. Another early example of Viking-themed heavy metal is the 1979 album "From the Fjords" by the American band Legend. Swedish <a href="neoclassical%20metal">neoclassical metal</a> guitarist <a href="Yngwie%20Malmsteen">Yngwie Malmsteen</a> sometimes featured themes of hyper-masculinity, heroic warriors, and Vikings; for example, on his 1985 album" <a href="Marching%20Out">Marching Out</a>". The German band <a href="Grave%20Digger%20%28band%29">Grave Digger</a> and American band <a href="Manowar">Manowar</a>, both of which formed in 1980, drew upon Norse myth as envisioned in <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>". Faithful Breath – which wore fur and horned helmet costumes – and <a href="TNT%20%28Norwegian%20band%29">TNT</a> also experimented with Viking themes. Manowar adopted Viking imagery much more heavily than other bands, and became known as the "champions of the furry loincloth"; they met with ridicule even within the metal community, but attracted a cult following. Unlike the later Viking metal bands, Manowar did not bother with the historicity of popular Viking image, and did not in any way identify with the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski explain that "the Manowar version of the Vikings owes as much to <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> as it does to history, saga, or <a href="Edda">Edda</a>: What matters to Manowar is untamed masculinity, and the Vikings are for them merely the archetypal barbarian males."

The term "Viking metal" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was "noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, "slow black metal" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and <a href="folk%20metal">folk metal</a> almost equally, or running the gamut from "folk to black to death metal". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a "swift, galloping pace". These artists often add "local cultural flourishes" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls.
Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as <a href="Unleashed%20%28band%29">Unleashed</a> and <a href="Amon%20Amarth">Amon Amarth</a>, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of <a href="medieval%20music">medieval music</a>, "it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident." Viking metal, and the closely related style <a href="pagan%20metal">pagan metal</a>, is more of a term or "etiquette" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that "The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly shifting, as trends and fads emerge and fade." From its origins in black metal, Viking metal "has diversified (at least in aural terms), and now covers a range of styles that run the gamut between black metal and what one might justifiably term <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a>".

Starting with the album "<a href="Blood%20Fire%20Death">Blood Fire Death</a>", one of the first definitive Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, <a href="Sea%20shanty">shanty</a>-like melodies and folk music elements such as <a href="drone%20%28music%29">bourdon</a> sounds, Jew's harps, and <a href="Fife%20%28instrument%29">fifes</a>. Bathory added natural <a href="Found%20object%23Music">found sounds</a>, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of "<a href="musique%20concr%C3%A8te">musique concrète</a>". Instruments were sometimes used to create <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections – <a href="introduction%20%28music%29">introduction</a>, <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, and <a href="finale%20%28music%29">finale</a> – and two vocal sections – <a href="stanza">stanza</a> and <a href="refrain">refrain</a>.

<a href="Enslaved%20%28band%29">Enslaved</a>, a formative band in Viking metal, performs primarily a black metal style, but has over time become more progressive. Eduardo Rivadavia described the hallmarks of Enslaved as "Viking themes, razor sharp guitars, <a href="blastbeat">blastbeat</a> drums, and an ear for orchestration resulting in complex structures, bountiful harmonies and time changes." However, the band has evolved significantly with every album since "<a href="Mardraum%20%E2%80%93%20Beyond%20the%20Within">Mardraum – Beyond the Within</a>" (2000) onward.

The Faroese band Týr has a standard rock band lineup with electric instruments, but makes extensive use of traditional Faroese music in its songs. Faroese ballads typically involve unusual time signatures, most commonly or the alternative rhythms or . In an attempt to replicate these uneven signatures, Týr often places the <a href="accent%20%28music%29">accent</a> on the weak beat of the <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bar</a>. In songs based on old Faroese ballads, Týr usually play in harmonic or melodic <a href="minor%20scale">minor scale</a> or else in <a href="Mixolydian%20mode%23Modern%20Mixolydian">mixolydian mode</a>.

Mulvany states that "Viking metal ... is much less concerned with traditional aural materials like instruments and melodies. Instead, Viking bands limit themselves mainly to the use of Norse mythology as a textual source, which they often augment with stylized shanty-like melodies that are meant to evoke apropos images". He elaborates: According to Mulvany, Viking metal draws heavily on <a href="sea%20shanty">sea shanties</a> and media images of <a href="Piracy%23History">pirates</a> and Vikings, an influence evident in two basic forms of the genre. The first type "is largely <a href="steps%20and%20skips">stepwise</a> in motion with many repeated note figures", is frequently in <a href="minor%20key">minor key</a>, and is primarily sung in unison. The second type uses an "arching ascent-descent structure" and is less dependent on lyrics, making it "more evocative of rolling waves on the open sea". As examples of the first type, Mulvany examined the structures of sea shanties such as "<a href="Drunken%20Sailor">Drunken Sailor</a>", the 1934 and 1996 film soundtrack versions of "<a href="Dead%20Man%27s%20Chest">Dead Man's Chest</a>", <a href="Mario%20Nascimbene">Mario Nascimbene</a>'s "Viking" song for the 1958 film <a href="The%20Vikings%20%281958%20film%29">"The Vikings"</a>, and the chant from Monty Python's "<a href="Spam%20%28Monty%20Python%29">Spam</a>" sketch, and found similar structures in compositions by Viking and black metal bands such as Einherjer, <a href="Mithotyn">Mithotyn</a>, <a href="Naglfar%20%28band%29">Naglfar</a>, and Vargevinter. The second type, that of arching ascent and descent, Mulvany noticed in compositions by Einherjer and <a href="Borknagar">Borknagar</a>.

The shanty influence results from stereotyping in which certain aural associations are equated with "images of sailors, sea-borne marauders, and Vikings", and "though rooted in traditional sea shanties, these aural images have been perpetuated through the media of pirate movies and television shows, and they have been extended – by association – to Vikings". Ashby and Schofield agree with Mulvany that musically, Viking metal bands generally are unconnected with a real Viking past, but instead connote a broader sense of the maritime, presuming that "this conflation of maritime contexts is a knowing one, but one nonetheless felt to be somehow evocative."

Keith Fay of the folk metal band <a href="Cruachan%20%28band%29">Cruachan</a> has also noted the influence of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine "<a href="Terrorizer%20%28magazine%29">Terrorizer</a>", he said that there is "no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand what real folk music is; though I know this is not true for all of them."

Thematically, Viking metal draws extensively on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation of violence and virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, with an interest in ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: <a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Thor's hammers</a> are especially common, but other artifacts such as <a href="Oseberg%20Ship">Oseberg posts</a> and even the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo helmet</a> have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band <a href="Moonsorrow">Moonsorrow</a>'s use of prehistoric rock carvings and <a href="megaliths">megaliths</a>. Other Finnish bands, such as <a href="Ensiferum">Ensiferum</a>, <a href="Turisas">Turisas</a>, and <a href="Korpiklaani">Korpiklaani</a>, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.

While heavy metal throughout its history has referenced the occult, Viking metal bands use a very specific mythology, which informs their textual choices, album imagery, and, frequently, musical compositions. Despite a whole <a href="List%20of%20Germanic%20deities">pantheon of Norse gods</a> to choose from, Viking metal bands typically focus on <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, the god of war, and on <a href="Thor">Thor</a> and his hammer. <a href="Alcoholic%20beverage">Alcohol</a>, particularly <a href="mead">mead</a>, is also a common lyrical focus. Viking metal bands tend to follow one of two approaches. The first is one of romanticism and escapist ideas, where bands cultivate an image of strength and barbarism and quote passages from various poems and <a href="sagas">sagas</a>. The second approach emphasizes historical accuracy, typically relying on Norse mythology as the sole focus of lyricism and identity. Many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots – for instance, Moonsorrow with Finland or <a href="Einherjer">Einherjer</a> with Norway – with a wider northern European identity coming second.

Many songs are composed in English, but Viking metal bands often write lyrics in other languages, usually of the <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages">North Germanic</a> family – <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a>, <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>, <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>, <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> and, less commonly, <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a> and <a href="Faroese%20language">Faroese</a> – and also in <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a>, which is non-Germanic. Other European languages, such as <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a>, <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, <a href="Sami%20languages">Sami languages</a>, or <a href="Gaulish%20language">Gaulish</a> are sometimes used. Heavy metal fans around the world sometimes learn languages such as Norwegian or Finnish in order to understand the lyrics of their favorite bands and improve their appreciation of the music.

The imagery in Viking metal draws upon the material culture created during the Viking Age, but — according to Trafford and Pluskowski — it also "encompasses the broad <a href="Semiotics">semiotic</a> system favored by many black and death metal bands, not least of all the exultation of violence and hyper-masculinity expressed through weapons and battlefields". In Viking metal this semiotic system is melded with an interest in ancestral roots, specifically a pre-Christian heritage, "expressed visually through Viking mythology and the aesthetics of northern landscapes". Extreme and obsessive loathing of Christianity had long been the norm for black and death metal bands, but in the 1990s Bathory and many other bands began turning away from Satanism as the primary opposition to Christianity, instead placing their faith in the Vikings and Odin. Many artists claim affiliation to the modern Pagan religion of <a href="Heathenry%20%28new%20religious%20movement%29">Heathenry</a>, treating Christianity as a foreign influence that was forcibly imposed, and therefore as a wrong to be righted.

Some members of the Norwegian black metal scene were motivated to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians <a href="Varg%20Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a>, <a href="Samoth">Samoth</a>, <a href="Faust%20%28musician%29">Faust</a>, and <a href="J%C3%B8rn%20Inge%20Tunsberg">Jørn Inge Tunsberg</a>, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, and <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and <a href="Einherjer">Einherjer</a>, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked to the past and took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic – it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as <a href="Slechtvalk">Slechtvalk</a>, <a href="Drottnar">Drottnar</a>, and <a href="Holy%20Blood%20%28band%29">Holy Blood</a>, subscribe to Christian beliefs.

David Keevill argues that the explicitly anti-Christian attitude of most Viking metal artists is an anachronistic view of the Viking Age. Keevill explains that "while bands have used [Viking mythology] as the basis for their musical existence ... the historical reality of the Viking Age (late 8th century to the 11th century) is a chequered backdrop of a multitude of belief systems and disparate political mechanisms". As an historical example, he cites the <a href="Lindisfarne%23Vikings">raid on Lindisfarne</a> in 793, an event considered the beginning of the Viking Age and celebrated by Enslaved in its song "793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)". He contends that this attack was merely an opportunistic raid, not a concerted attack on the growing power of Christianity, and that the terms "heathen" and "pagan" historically did not necessarily mean "anti-Christian", but that the people in question did not fit under a denominational label. Furthermore, Norse religion and Christianity intermingled and influenced each other throughout the era, and Christianity was often imposed through monarchical regimes such as <a href="Harald%20Klak">Harald Klak</a> and <a href="Harald%20Bluetooth">Harald Bluetooth</a> or conversion movements such as those initiated by <a href="Ansgar">Ansgar</a>. Keevill concludes that, "It's not that bands like Amon Amarth shouldn't flout their Norse heritage, the bellicose nature of the ancestors or the kind of practices that would have taken place in far flung tribal societies, it's just that ruling out the presence of an overbearing Christian influence on the Viking Age is incredibly close-minded."

Viking metal has been considered the progenitor of the pagan metal genre, with Bathory's "<a href="Hammerheart">Hammerheart</a>" as the first pagan metal recording. Weinstein writes that "it is fitting that pagan metal began with Viking metal, given that the Vikings were Europe's last Pagans, converted slowly and with reluctance to Christianity". However, there are some key differences, as Imke von Helden explains: "[Pagan metal] deals mainly with <a href="Paganism">Pagan religions</a> and lies in a broader context where not only Old Norse mythology is dealt with, but also <a href="Celtic%20mythology">Celtic myths</a> and <a href="Celtic%20history">history</a>, <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s and other elements of <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. Traditional instruments like the violin or flute are used more often in pagan than in Viking metal music." The idea of incorporating and revering exclusively national or regional myths, stories, and tales first took root in the work of artists such as <a href="Adorned%20Brood">Adorned Brood</a>, Falkenbach, <a href="Black%20Messiah%20%28band%29">Black Messiah</a>, Enslaved or Einherjer, but, as a musical phenomenon, has grown far beyond Europe into a global trend in which artists express their affinity with an ethnic heritage. Viking metal, along with pagan and folk metal, forms part of a trend within cultural heritage movements toward wider acceptance of the heritage of ordinary and the everyday life, not just nationally significant and the iconic imagery, and also a trend to explore the outer reaches of heritage, where the definitions of heritage and heritage communities are stretched and contested.

The Viking image in popular understanding is that of <a href="hypermasculinity">hypermasculinity</a>, and thus Viking metal is inherently <a href="patriarchy">patriarchal</a>. While some bands, such as <a href="Kivimets%C3%A4n%20Druidi">Kivimetsän Druidi</a>, <a href="Storm%20%28Norwegian%20band%29">Storm</a>, and Irminsul, have included female members, and female fans comprise a substantial part of Viking metal's audience, it is argued that women are subordinated within the Viking metal scene, and are rarely present in the production of Viking metal music, which can be seen as a form of "nation-building": while women may participate in the nation building process, it is still controlled by men. Within Viking metal, themes of war and masculinity predominate.

Some artists, such as Burzum, link manliness with Norse tradition and gender ideals, and thus see the Viking male as representing traditional masculinity. Most of the Norse references in black metal are heroic, masculine, and militaristic in theme – Mjölnir, Odin, the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a>, and <a href="berserker">berserker</a>s and <a href="einherjar">einherjar</a>. Conversely, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, though a male figure, is seen in songs such as "Jesu død" by Burzum as cold, dark, and life-extinguishing. Christianity is viewed as stigmatizing and suppressing the natural "dark" sides of men, and so, from the perspective of black metal, true masculinity is achieved through exploring the dark sides of man's nature – warfare and killing. Cultural historian Nina Witoszec found that within Norway, images of nature are often symbolic with cultural affiliation to Norway. Witoszec traces the roots of this ideal to <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>'s German-heathen identity narrative which romanticized the Germanic people as superior through their connection with nature, and whose brutality and belligerence opposed the apathetic and decadent Roman elite. Within black metal, Norse imagery is used to build a view of natural and authentic masculinity to counter the oppressive force of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

The roots of Viking metal are generally found in Scandinavian metal, particularly the death and black metal scenes of the late 1980s. Inspired by the Viking themes used by Manowar, some bands identified with the Vikings far more completely than Manowar. At the forefront of this movement stood the Swedish band Bathory. The band's fourth album "Blood Fire Death", released in 1988, includes two early examples of Viking metal – the songs "A Fine Day to Die" and "Blood Fire Death". The cover to "Blood Fire Death" even features "<a href="The%20wild%20Hunt%20of%20Odin">The wild Hunt of Odin</a>", a painting by Norwegian artist <a href="Peter%20Nicolai%20Arbo">Peter Nicolai Arbo</a> which depicts the Norse god Odin on a <a href="Wild%20Hunt">Wild Hunt</a>. Bathory followed up on this Viking theme in 1990 with the release of "Hammerheart", a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> fully devoted to Vikings. Like its predecessor, this album features a Viking-themed painting, this time "The Funeral of a Viking" by <a href="Frank%20Dicksee">Sir Frank Dicksee</a>. Following up this release were 1991's "<a href="Twilight%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28album%29">Twilight of the Gods</a>", titled after Wagner's <a href="G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung">opera of the same name</a>, and "<a href="Blood%20on%20Ice">Blood on Ice</a>", recorded in 1988–1989 but released in 1996. "Hammerheart" is considered a landmark that introduced the metal world to the Viking metal archetype. With this album, Quorthon, the band's founder, inspired a generation of Nordic teens, and seeded a deep anti-Christian sentiment which culminated in the violence and hate crimes committed by members of the Norwegian black metal community in the early 1990s. Quorthon later explained, in the liner notes to "Blood on Ice", that his shift to Viking themes was an intentional move away from Satanism: 

Bathory's Viking metal features Wagnerian-style epics, ostentatious arrangements, choruses, and ambient keyboards. Mulvany notes that Bathory's 1990s work marks the beginning of a Viking-themed trend initially slow, even confusing, in formation. For example, the Austrian black metal band <a href="Abigor">Abigor</a> incorporated Viking themes and Germanic paganism in "Unleashed Axe-Age", the first track on its 1994 album "Nachthymnen", but said it "should not be seen as a part of the upcoming Viking trend". According to Mulvany, "The Viking trend presaged by Abigor was actually taking place around them, and it remains more 'true' to how black metal is often defined than the folk influenced metal that followed. Its folk elements are predominantly textual or musically evocative rather than musically-historically accurate."

Enslaved, formed in Norway in 1991, has also been cited as the first truly Viking metal band, with the 1993 EP by the band, "<a href="Hordanes%20Land">Hordanes Land</a>", named as the first true Viking metal release. A review of "<a href="Eld%20%28album%29">Eld</a>" (1997) noted that "Among the countless bands who were inspired by Bathory's seminal Viking metal, arguably none were as true to its gospel as Norway's Enslaved, whose utmost commitment even extended to donning vintage Norse armor and outfits on-stage". The band's 1994 debut album "<a href="Vikingligr%20Veldi">Vikingligr Veldi</a>" had "many melodies being borrowed from ethnic Scandinavian <a href="Nordic%20folk%20music">folk music</a> to lend additional authenticity to the vicious, fast-paced black metal". Inspired by Bathory, Enslaved set out to "create Viking metal devoted to retelling Norway's legends and traditions of old – not attacking Christianity by means of its own creation: Satan." Its second album "<a href="Frost%20%28album%29">Frost</a>", also released in 1994, served as "an important release for the extreme music subgenre of Viking metal". Though the previous recordings by Enslaved all featured the same thematic material, "Frost" was the first album that Enslaved described as Viking metal. This album also defined the band's lyrical approach. "<a href="Decibel%20%28magazine%29">Decibel</a>" explains that on "Frost", bassist and vocalist Grutle Kjellson "knew it was time to reclaim the gods and goddesses of his ancestors, especially if it meant his version of things would inevitably clash with the Christianized fairytales so often associated with Nordic myth."

Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped inspire the Viking metal scene through his strongly held racist, nationalistic, and anti-<a href="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a> beliefs, and his longing for a return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century <a href="Fantoft%20Stave%20Church">Fantoft Stave Church</a> in <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>: he adopted the name 'Count <a href="Middle-earth%20Orc%20characters%23Grishn%C3%A1kh">Grishnackh</a>', based upon an <a href="orc">orc</a> in "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>", and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book "Vargsmål", which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the "<a href="H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l">Hávamál</a>," though with "an eye on "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>"". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, "proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name <a href="Quisling">Quisling</a> to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to <a href="Vidkun%20Quisling">the wartime collaborator</a>".

Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the <a href="Number%20of%20the%20Beast">Number of the Beast</a>. Vikernes contends that the date June 6 was really picked because the first recorded Viking raid (upon Lindisfarne) occurred, according to Vikernes, on June 6, 793. Quorthon acknowledged that nationalist elements had always been present in the Viking metal scene, and, in the early 1990s, these elements hardened into explicit racism and anti-Semitism, particularly among Heathen adherents. However, by the late 1990s, Viking metal pulled back from the <a href="neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> direction toward which it was headed, once many musicians from the Oslo scene died or were jailed.

Besides Bathory, Enslaved, and Burzum, several other artists are credited as pioneers of the style. The original bassist for Emperor, Håvard Ellefsen, also known as <a href="Mortiis">Mortiis</a>, was "an indispensable force in the genesis of Norway's epic Viking metal sound." Despite Ellefsen's short tenure in the band, it was his musical interests that catalyzed the band to mix chaotic black metal with <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a> melodies based on Norwegian folk music.

<a href="Helheim%20%28band%29">Helheim</a> was another major pioneer in the early scene. Helheim emerged on the scene before other bands such as Einherjer and <a href="Thyrfing">Thyrfing</a>, when even Enslaved was in its infancy. Not only was Helheim one of the first bands to meld black metal with Viking themed-music, but one of the first to include stylistically unconventional instruments such as horns and violins. Robert Müller of <a href="Metal%20Hammer">"Metal Hammer" "Germany"</a> argues that Viking metal never solidified as a genre, and attributes this to "<a href="Jormundgand">Jormundgand</a>", Helheim's 1995 debut album. "Jormundgand" included an ambitious track – "Galder" – but that song was considered incompatible with metal, and audiences, looking for a specific musical style, merged with the pagan metal scene, which had no particular "Viking" identity.

Other highly influential Viking metal bands are Borknagar, <a href="Darkwoods%20My%20Betrothed">Darkwoods My Betrothed</a>, Einherjer, Ensiferum, Moonsorrow, Thyrfing, and Windir. Trafford and Pluskowski regard Einherjer, Moonsorrow, Thyrfing, and Windir as the "most influential" Viking metal bands, with Einherjer's album covers, which include many images of Viking artifacts, giving Einherjer the most Viking feel of all bands except Enslaved. Einherjer's artwork spans the full chronology of <a href="Viking%20art">Viking art</a>: 8th- and 9th-century <a href="Viking%20art%23Oseberg%20Style">Oseberg</a> to 11th- and 12th-century <a href="Viking%20art%23Urnes%20Style">Urnes</a>.

Amon Amarth and Unleashed's music could be described as death metal, but it incorporates Viking lyrical themes and thus the bands are considered to have broadened the scope of Viking metal. While Norse myths were mostly important for black metal, especially the early 1990s Norwegian scene, as well as for the younger pagan metal genre, bands as the Swedish Unleashed started fitting these myths into death metal even before Amon Amarth appeared. Unleashed set a precedent for many of the coming black metal bands by shying away from the common death metal theme of gore and instead focusing on pre-Christian Swedish heathenism, particularly the Viking Age and old Norse religion. Both Amon Amarth and Unleashed, however, resist the Viking metal label. Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth stated, "It's weird to label a band after the lyrical content because, in that case, <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> is a Viking metal band, <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> is a Viking metal band, Led Zeppelin is a Viking metal band." Johnny Hedlund of Unleashed maintains that the band has always played and always will play death metal, commenting, "The Viking lyrics you will find on about three to five songs on every Unleashed album from 1991 and on. I don't think that fact alone re-defines our style in some way."

Some members of the Viking metal scene believe that it is impossible for someone to be a Viking unless they themselves are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread to other parts of Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including <a href="Horned%20helmet%23Popular%20association%20with%20Vikings">horned helmets</a>. Another Austrian example is <a href="Amestigon">Amestigon</a>, which on the cover of its promotional album "Remembering Ancient Origins" depicts a wood carved scene of <a href="Sigurd">Sigurd</a> killing <a href="Regin">Regin</a>, an image taken from a panel held in <a href="Hylestad%20stave%20church">Hylestad stave church</a>.

One of the first non-Nordic Viking metal bands was the German project <a href="Falkenbach">Falkenbach</a>. Formed in 1989 and primarily the work of front-man <a href="Vratyas%20Vakyas">Vratyas Vakyas</a>, Falkenbach performs a mixture of black metal and folk music, with lyrics drawing from Western and Northern European mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. The Dutch bands <a href="Heidevolk">Heidevolk</a>, <a href="Slechtvalk">Slechtvalk</a>, and Fenris have also been labeled as Viking metal, though Heidevolk's former vocalist Joris Boghtdrincker claims that Heidevolk has never tried to "play the Viking card or the Pan-Germanic card", instead choosing to write about local Dutch history. The Swiss band <a href="Eluveitie">Eluveitie</a> jokingly calls its music "the new wave of folk metal", which vocalist <a href="Chrigel%20Glanzmann">Chrigel Glanzmann</a> explains was because the "whole folk metal thing was still quite new back then, and the scene and the music press was looking for new labels for that kind of music, so they came up with Forest Metal, Viking Metal, Heathen Metal, Pagan Metal, blah blah blah, and we just felt like it was really really ridiculous."

Catherine Hoad finds the issue of national and racial identity central to Viking metal. For instance, she writes that when Trafford and Pluskowski claim that Manowar could not claim religious or racial identity with the Vikings when the band had a lead singer with the "'less than wholly Scandinavian name of <a href="Joey%20DeMaio">Joey di Maio</a>', [Trafford and Pluskowski] are approaching a more complex and racially-charged issue than their offhandedness would suggest." While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad the definition of a "true" Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: "Some people understand perfectly that it doesn't matter where you live, what's really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood." Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of <a href="Christian%20metal">Christian</a> Viking metal, but is rarely criticized as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.

According to Weinstein, "Viking metal has travelled further than any Viking ship. Self-defined pagan metal bands who describe their music as Viking metal can be found in the United States, Brazil and Uruguay, among other places." The sensationalism of the early Norwegian black metal scene might be responsible for some of this popularity, but Weinstein considers the genre's greatest influence to be "the inspiration it has given to others to explore their own roots". This impact was particularly strong in the Baltic states, where Viking metal influenced the development of a distinct pagan metal scene known as "<a href="Baltic%20war%20metal">Baltic war metal</a>". The Lithuanian band <a href="Obtest">Obtest</a>, formed as a black metal band in 1993 with <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> lyrics, birthed the war metal scene with the 1997 album "Tūkstantmetis." Michael F. Strmiska comments that despite the claim that Scandinavia was home to the last pagans in Europe, within the scene: "A point of particular pride is the knowledge that Lithuania was the last country in all of Europe to officially abandon its native Pagan traditions and convert to Christianity in 1387." Another Baltic band influenced by Viking metal is the Latvian project <a href="Skyforger">Skyforger</a>, which composes its lyrics in the <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian language</a>. A third example of the influence of Viking metal on pagan metal is the <a href="national%20socialist%20black%20metal">national socialist black metal</a> band <a href="Graveland">Graveland</a> from Poland, which on its second album, "Thousand Swords", released in 1995, featured a variety of folk styles mixed in with the band's black metal sound, and introduced lyrics about Polish history and Slavic gods. Viking metal has also influenced the Russian <a href="Slavic%20neopaganism">Rodnoverie</a> movement, particularly the texts of Varg Vikernes, many of which have been translated into Russian. Though some of his readers within Rodnoverie distance themselves from the racism and political statements within Vikernes' work, other followers have embraced racist and National Socialist ideas. Contemporaneous to the rise of Viking metal has been the emergence of <a href="Celtic%20metal">Celtic metal</a> in Ireland, France, and even Germany, a style which sounds essentially like Viking metal, apart from the addition of <a href="harp">harp</a>s, but with lyrics celebrating <a href="Celtic%20deities">Celtic gods</a> and <a href="Celtic%20mythology">myths</a>.

Nine Inch Nails

Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN (stylized as NIИ), is an American <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> band that was formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1988. The band consists of producer and multi-instrumentalist <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>, as well as English musician <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>. Over the course of their three-decade existence, the band has signed with several major labels, the most current being <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, under the name The Null Corporation.

The origins of the band date back to 1988, while Reznor was employed as a janitor at a studio in Cleveland. Utilizing off-hour sessions, Reznor recorded and released the band's debut album, the synth-pop oriented "<a href="Pretty%20Hate%20Machine">Pretty Hate Machine</a>" (1989), under <a href="TVT%20Records">TVT Records</a> to minor success. However, Reznor feuded with the label about promotion. While attempting to terminate his contract, Reznor signed with <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> and released the extended play "<a href="Broken%20%28EP%29">Broken</a>" (1992), a release that diverged significantly from the sound of their debut. Their second and third albums, "<a href="The%20Downward%20Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a>" (1994) and "<a href="The%20Fragile%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20album%29">The Fragile</a>" (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success, bringing the band massive popularity, before going on hiatus. The band resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>" (2005), to further success. Following the release of their fifth album, "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28album%29">Year Zero</a>" (2007), Reznor left Interscope over a dispute of physical copies of the album. The band continued touring and independently released their sixth and seventh albums, "<a href="Ghosts%20I%E2%80%93IV">Ghosts I-IV</a>" (2008) and <a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29">"The Slip"</a> (2008), before going on hiatus a second time. Returning in 2013, the band released their eighth album, "<a href="Hesitation%20Marks">Hesitation Marks</a>" (2013), under Columbia Records, followed by a trilogy of releases spanning from 2016-2018, including the EPs "<a href="Not%20the%20Actual%20Events">Not The Actual Events</a>" (2016) and "<a href="Add%20Violence">Add Violence</a>" (2017), as well as their ninth album, "<a href="Bad%20Witch">Bad Witch</a>" (2018).

Prior to 2016, Reznor was considered the only constant member and creative force of the band, acting as its founder, lead singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. In December 2016, English musician <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>, a frequent collaborator with Reznor, was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live%20performances">to perform with him onstage</a>. The touring band has comprised several lineups over the course of three decades, the current of which is composed of <a href="Robin%20Finck">Robin Finck</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a>, and <a href="Ilan%20Rubin">Ilan Rubin</a>. Their tours often employ thematic visual elements to accompany on-stage performances, which frequently include elaborate light shows, and songs are often rearranged to fit a live setting.

In addition to sales of over 20 million records worldwide, Nine Inch Nails have been nominated for thirteen <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, winning twice for the songs "<a href="Wish%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Wish</a>" and "<a href="Happiness%20in%20Slavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>" in 1992 and 1996, respectively. In 1997, Reznor appeared in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and "Spin" magazine has described him as "the most vital artist in music". In 2004, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on the magazine's <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20100%20Greatest%20Artists%20of%20All%20Time">list of the 100 greatest artists of all time</a>. Nine Inch Nails was named as a nominee for induction into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2014, its first year of eligibility. The band was nominated again the following year, but was not inducted.

In 1987, <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> played keyboard in a <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, Ohio band called the <a href="Exotic%20Birds">Exotic Birds</a>, then managed by <a href="John%20Malm%20Jr.">John Malm Jr.</a> Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds to work on music of his own, Malm informally became his manager. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios, in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him "just a little wear on [his] tape heads". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the <a href="Phantasy%20Theater">Phantasy Theater</a> in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the <a href="Pretty%20Hate%20Machine%20Tour%20Series">Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series</a>. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting <a href="Skinny%20Puppy">Skinny Puppy</a>, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch single</a> on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with <a href="TVT%20Records">TVT Records</a>. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as "Purest Feeling", were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, "<a href="Pretty%20Hate%20Machine">Pretty Hate Machine</a>" (1989). The overall sound on "Purest Feeling" is lighter than that of "Pretty Hate Machine"; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.

Reznor coined the name "Nine Inch Nails" because it "abbreviated easily", rather than for "any literal meaning". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to reference Jesus' crucifixion with nine-inch spikes, or <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>'s nine-inch fingernails. The English letters NIN are also noted for their resemblance to the modern Hebrew characters of the <a href="Tetragrammaton">Tetragrammaton</a>. The Nine Inch Nails' logo, which consists of the letters [NIИ] set inside a border, was designed by Reznor and <a href="Gary%20Talpas">Gary Talpas</a>, and first appeared on the music video for Nine Inch Nails' debut single, "<a href="Down%20in%20It">Down in It</a>", and was inspired by <a href="Tibor%20Kalman">Tibor Kalman</a>'s typography on the <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a> album "<a href="Remain%20in%20Light">Remain in Light</a>". Talpas, a native of Cleveland, would continue to design Nine Inch Nails packaging art until 1997.

Written, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album "<a href="Pretty%20Hate%20Machine">Pretty Hate Machine</a>" debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with <a href="Adrian%20Sherwood">Adrian Sherwood</a> (who produced the lead single "Down in It" in London without meeting Reznor face-to-face) and <a href="Flood%20%28producer%29">Mark "Flood" Ellis</a>. Reznor asked <a href="Sean%20Beavan">Sean Beavan</a> to mix the demos of "Pretty Hate Machine", which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles "<a href="Head%20Like%20a%20Hole">Head Like a Hole</a>" and "<a href="Sin%20%28song%29">Sin</a>". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"'s <a href="Michael%20Azerrad">Michael Azerrad</a> described the album as "industrial-strength noise over a pop framework" and "harrowing but catchy music"; Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time". In fact, the song "Down in It" spent over two months on "Billboard" club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, "Pretty Hate Machine" became one of the first <a href="independent%20music">independently released</a> records to attain <a href="RIAA%20certification">platinum certification</a>.
Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. <a href="MTV">MTV</a> aired the videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole", but an explicit video for "Sin" was only released in partial form for "<a href="Closure%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20VHS%29">Closure</a>". The original version of the "Down in It" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>. As Reznor explains in an interview with "Convulsion Magazine":

There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a "<a href="Lodger%20%28album%29">Lodger</a>"-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it ... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere ... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see the other members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.

In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked what shows they would like to appear on. They jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on "<a href="Dance%20Party%20USA">Dance Party USA</a>", since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.

In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the "<a href="Pretty%20Hate%20Machine%20Tour%20Series">Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series</a>", in which it toured North America as an opening act for <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> artists such as <a href="Peter%20Murphy%20%28musician%29">Peter Murphy</a> and <a href="The%20Jesus%20and%20Mary%20Chain">The Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. Reznor began <a href="Instrument%20destruction">smashing his equipment</a> while on stage; "Rockbeat" interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> festival in 1991.

After a poor European reception opening for <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, the band returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to "Pretty Hate Machine". After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> and created <a href="Nothing%20Records">Nothing Records</a>:

We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record "Broken" under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a> got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.

In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to <a href="10050%20Cielo%20Drive%2C%20Benedict%20Canyon%2C%20Los%20Angeles">10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles</a> (renamed "Le Pig" by Reznor), the site of the <a href="Tate%20murders">Tate murders</a>, when <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>'s "family" murdered <a href="Sharon%20Tate">Sharon Tate</a>, wife of noted film director <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>, and four of her friends. The band used it to record "Broken", an <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the "Billboard" 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 <a href="List%20of%20Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live-band%20members">Nine Inch Nails touring band</a> as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized "Broken" as a guitar-based "blast of destruction", and as "a lot harder ... than "Pretty Hate Machine"". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from "Broken" earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single "<a href="Happiness%20in%20Slavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>" from <a href="Woodstock%20%2794">Woodstock '94</a>, and the second single "<a href="Wish%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Wish</a>". In reference to receiving the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance</a> for "Wish", Reznor joked that "Wish" became "the only song to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics." Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.

<a href="Peter%20Christopherson">Peter Christopherson</a> of the bands <a href="Coil%20%28band%29">Coil</a> and <a href="Throbbing%20Gristle">Throbbing Gristle</a> directed a performance video for "Wish", but the EP's most controversial video accompanied "Happiness in Slavery". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a>ist <a href="Bob%20Flanagan">Bob Flanagan</a> disrobed and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him. A third video for "Pinion", partially incorporated into MTV's "Alternative Nation" opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in <a href="Bondage%20%28BDSM%29">bondage</a>. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for "Help Me I Am in Hell" and "Gave Up" into a longform music video titled "<a href="Broken%20%281993%20film%29">Broken</a>". It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for "Gave Up" featuring <a href="Richard%20Patrick">Richard Patrick</a> and <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of "Wish" was also filmed, and both videos appeared in "Closure".

"Broken" was followed by the companion remix EP "<a href="Fixed%20%28EP%29">Fixed</a>" in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of "Last", produced by <a href="Butch%20Vig">Butch Vig</a> (the outro of the "Last" remix is heard in "Throw This Away", which also includes Reznor's remix of "Suck"). The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11 kHz file, "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by <a href="FTP">FTP</a> from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on <a href="Peer-to-peer%20file%20sharing">p2p</a> networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. <a href="Duke%20Erikson">Duke</a> and <a href="Steve%20Marker">Steve</a> worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of <a href="Garbage%20%28band%29">Garbage</a>."

Early ideas for "The Downward Spiral" were conceived after the <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later used it as lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking the beginning of the making of both "Broken" and "The Downward Spiral". This was against his initial choice to record the album in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>.

Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, "<a href="The%20Downward%20Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a>", entered the "Billboard" 200 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in the United States for shipments of over four million copies, in addition to selling five million copies worldwide. Influenced by late-1970s works by <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> and <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, "The Downward Spiral" includes a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of a central character. Flood co-produced several tracks on the album, while <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a> mixed most of the album and subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future album releases. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on "The Downward Spiral". After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as "<a href="Closer%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Closer</a>", Beavan mixed and co-produced <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a>'s "<a href="Antichrist%20Superstar">Antichrist Superstar</a>" in 1996. As well as "Broken", "The Downward Spiral" was recorded at Le Pig Studios. "<a href="March%20of%20the%20Pigs">March of the Pigs</a>" and "<a href="Closer%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Closer</a>" were released as singles. Two other songs from the album, "<a href="Hurt%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Hurt</a>" and "<a href="Piggy%20%28song%29">Piggy</a>", were issued to radio without a commercial single release.

The music video for "Closer" was directed by <a href="Mark%20Romanek">Mark Romanek</a> and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a> mask, a monkey tied to a <a href="cross">cross</a>, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a <a href="vulva">vulva</a>, Reznor wearing an <a href="Sadomasochism">S&M</a> mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a <a href="ball%20gag">ball gag</a>. A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.

Critical response to "The Downward Spiral" has generally been favorable, and retrospective reviews regard it as one of the most important albums of the 1990s. It was included in several publications' best album lists: in 2005 the album was ranked 25th in <a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">"Spin"</a>'s list of the "100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005", and in 2003 "Rolling Stone" ranked the album number 200 on their "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>" list. "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" named it the 80th "Greatest American Album". It was ranked No. 488 in the book "The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time" by <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a>. In 2001 "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" named "The Downward Spiral" as one of the "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time"; in 2010 the album was ranked No. 102 on their "250 Best Albums of Q's Lifetime (1986–2011)" list. After "The Downward Spiral"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> release, Reznor produced an accompanying <a href="remix%20album">remix album</a> entitled "<a href="Further%20Down%20the%20Spiral">Further Down the Spiral</a>", the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold</a> in the United States and <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20remix%20albums">among the best-selling remix albums of all time</a>. It contained contributions from <a href="Coil%20%28band%29">Coil</a> with <a href="Danny%20Hyde">Danny Hyde</a>, electronic musician <a href="Aphex%20Twin">Aphex Twin</a>, producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>, and <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a> guitarist <a href="Dave%20Navarro">Dave Navarro</a>, among others.

After the 1994 release of "The Downward Spiral", the live band embarked on the <a href="Self%20Destruct%20Tour">Self Destruct Tour</a> in support of the album. The stage set-up contained dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as "Hurt". The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which the members would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves, and they would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd. The tour reached its widest mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at <a href="Woodstock%20%2794">Woodstock '94</a> that was broadcast on <a href="Pay-Per-View">Pay-Per-View</a> and seen in as many as 24 million homes. Nine Inch Nails received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and adding theatrical visual elements to the live show. Supporting acts for the tour included <a href="The%20Jim%20Rose%20Circus%20Sideshow">The Jim Rose Circus</a> and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the "Closure" video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of "Eraser", "Hurt" and a <a href="Long%20take">one-take</a> "March of the Pigs" clip directed by Peter Christoperson. Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of "<a href="The%20Fragile%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20album%29">The Fragile</a>".

Five years elapsed between "The Downward Spiral" and Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, "<a href="The%20Fragile%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20album%29">The Fragile</a>", which arrived as a <a href="double%20album">double album</a> in September 1999. "The Fragile" was conceived by making "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design ... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song." Canadian rock producer <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he "provided final continuity and flow."

On the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded "The Fragile" more than a year before its release, when it was already described as "oft-delayed". The album debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. "Spin" hailed "The Fragile" as the "album of the year," whereas <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> panned its "melodramatic" lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20World%20Went%20Away">The Day the World Went Away</a>" in North America; "<a href="We%27re%20in%20This%20Together">We're in This Together</a>" in the EU and Japan (on three separate discs); and "<a href="Into%20the%20Void%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Into the Void</a>" in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the "Billboard" Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the <a href="Billboard%20200%23Biggest%20drops%20from%20number-one">biggest drop from number one</a>, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.

Before the album's release, the song "<a href="Starfuckers%2C%20Inc.">Starfuckers, Inc.</a>" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. <a href="Cinesexuality">Cinesexuality</a> critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a "scathing attack on the alternative music scene," particularly Reznor's former friend and protégé Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled "Starsuckers, Inc." and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in 2000.

Reznor followed "The Fragile" with another remix album, "<a href="Things%20Falling%20Apart">Things Falling Apart</a>", released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 "<a href="Fragility%20Tour">Fragility</a>" tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as "<a href="And%20All%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been">And All That Could Have Been</a>". A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc "<a href="And%20All%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been%23Still">Still</a>", containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.

During the "Fragility 2.0" tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober.

In 2002, <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> covered the Nine Inch Nails' "<a href="Hurt%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Hurt</a>" for his album, "", to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition:
I pop the video in, and wow ... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps ... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore ... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning — different, but every bit as pure.

A further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album. "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>" was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. "With Teeth" debuted on top of the "Billboard" 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the <a href="Uniform%20Resource%20Locator">URL</a> for an online <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">PDF</a> poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in <a href="streaming%20audio">streaming audio</a> on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date.

Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: "Rolling Stone"'s <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> described the album as "vintage Nine Inch Nails". <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> condemned the album, claiming Reznor "ran out of ideas."

A music video for the song "<a href="The%20Hand%20That%20Feeds">The Hand That Feeds</a>" premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in <a href="GarageBand">GarageBand</a> format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album's second single "<a href="Only%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Only</a>" in a wider range of formats, including <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> and <a href="ACID%20Pro">ACID Pro</a>. <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a> directed a video for "Only" with primarily <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a>. The planned music video for its third single, "<a href="Every%20Day%20Is%20Exactly%20the%20Same">Every Day Is Exactly the Same</a>", was directed by <a href="Francis%20Lawrence">Francis Lawrence</a> but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the "Billboard" <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Alternative Songs</a> chart.

Nine Inch Nails launched a in Autumn 2005, supported by <a href="Queens%20of%20the%20Stone%20Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href="Autolux">Autolux</a> and <a href="Death%20from%20Above%201979">Death from Above 1979</a>. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist <a href="Saul%20Williams">Saul Williams</a>, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the <a href="Voodoo%20Music%20Experience">Voodoo Music Experience</a> festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American <a href="Amphitheatre%23Contemporary%20amphitheatres">amphitheaters</a> in the summer of 2006, joined by <a href="Bauhaus%20%28band%29">Bauhaus</a>, <a href="TV%20on%20the%20Radio">TV on the Radio</a>, and <a href="Peaches%20%28musician%29">Peaches</a>. The "<a href="Beside%20You%20in%20Time">Beside You in Time</a>" tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> Disc. The <a href="home%20video">home video</a> release debuted at number one on both the <a href="Billboard%20charts%23Top%20Music%20Video">"Billboard" Top Music Videos</a> and <a href="Billboard%20charts%23Billboard%20Comprehensive%20Music%20Videos">"Billboard" Comprehensive Music Videos</a> charts in the United States.

Nine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28album%29">Year Zero</a>", was released only two years after "With Teeth", a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, "Year Zero" is a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> criticizing the <a href="United%20States%20government">United States government</a>'s policies and their impact on the world 15 years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

The story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed "Year 0", by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Bureau%20of%20Morality">Bureau of Morality</a> and the <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23First%20Evangelical%20Church%20of%20Plano">First Evangelical Church of Plano</a>. The government corporation <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Cedocore">Cedocore</a> distributes the drug <a href="Parepin">Parepin</a> through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Art%20is%20Resistance">Art is Resistance</a> and <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Solutions%20Backwards%20Initiative">Solutions Backwards Initiative</a>. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.

<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28alternate%20reality%20game%29">An alternate reality game</a> emerged parallel to the "Year Zero" concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an "<a href="Orwellian">Orwellian</a> picture of the United States circa the year 2022". Before "Year Zero"'s release, unreleased songs from the album were found on <a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB drive</a>s hidden at Nine Inch Nails <a href="Performance%202007%20Tour">concert venues</a> in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a> caught the attention of media outlets such as "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" and "Billboard", who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries.

The album's first single, "<a href="Survivalism%20%28song%29">Survivalism</a>", and other tracks from "Year Zero" were released as <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack</a> audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled "<a href="Year%20Zero%20Remixed">Year Zero Remixed</a>" was later released, containing remixes from "Year Zero" by other artists. The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes.

Reznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted "Year Zero" as "part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist." The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for "Year Zero" as a film, then Reznor found American film producer <a href="Lawrence%20Bender">Lawrence Bender</a> and met with writers.
On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: "We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens." Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writer's Guild strike</a>, but it nevertheless continued. the resultant miniseries, also named "Year Zero", was in development with <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and <a href="BBC">BBC</a> Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and "<a href="Carniv%C3%A0le">Carnivàle</a>" writer <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a>.

In February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled "2 weeks." On March 2, "<a href="Ghosts%20I%E2%80%93IV">Ghosts I–IV</a>" (the first release on <a href="The%20Null%20Corporation">The Null Corporation</a> label), a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band's official website. "Ghosts I–IV" was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days. The album is licensed under a <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> <a href="Creative%20Commons%20licenses">Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> licence. The album was created improvisationally over a 10-week period and contributors included <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>, <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a>, <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Viglione">Brian Viglione</a>.

Similar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of "Ghosts I–IV", a post on the band's website in April 2008 read "2 weeks!" On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released "<a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29">The Slip</a>" via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, "this one's on me," protected under the same Creative Commons licence as "Ghosts", and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4 million. "The Slip" has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000.

Since the release of "Ghosts I–IV" and "The Slip", a 25-date tour titled "<a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29%23Lights%20in%20the%20Sky%20tour">Lights in the Sky</a>", was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and <a href="Josh%20Freese">Josh Freese</a> returned as members from the previous tour, while <a href="Robin%20Finck">Robin Finck</a> rejoined the band and <a href="Justin%20Meldal-Johnsen">Justin Meldal-Johnsen</a> was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of <a href="Ilan%20Rubin">Ilan Rubin</a> on drums.

On January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 <a href="Gigabyte">GB</a> via <a href="BitTorrent%20%28protocol%29">BitTorrent</a>. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional 3-part digital film, followed by a physical release created "by fans for fans". This tour documentary became collectively known as "<a href="Another%20Version%20of%20the%20Truth">Another Version of the Truth</a>" and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Techdirt">Techdirt</a> and <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork TV</a>, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster <a href="Rob%20Sheridan">Rob Sheridan</a> noted on the band's official website:

This is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.

"<a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20Revenge">Nine Inch Nails Revenge</a>", an <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>/<a href="iPod%20touch">iPod touch</a>-exclusive <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm game</a> developed by <a href="Tapulous">Tapulous</a>, was released on March 8, 2009 (five months after the company announced the development of the game). This installment in the "<a href="Tap%20Tap%20Revenge">Tap Tap</a>" video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from "Ghosts I–IV" and "The Slip". Portions of the album "Ghosts I-IV" were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary "Citizenfour."

In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that "I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while." Reznor since clarified that he "isn't done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future." The "Wave Goodbye" tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the <a href="Wiltern%20Theater">Wiltern Theater</a> in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film "", and a cover of <a href="U2">U2</a>'s "<a href="Zoo%20Station%20%28song%29">Zoo Station</a>", included in the "<a href="Achtung%20Baby">Achtung Baby</a>" tribute album "<a href="AHK-toong%20BAY-bi%20Covered">AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered</a>".

In 2009 Reznor married <a href="Mariqueen%20Maandig">Mariqueen Maandig</a>, and formed a project with Maandig and <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a> dubbed <a href="How%20to%20Destroy%20Angels%20%28band%29">How to Destroy Angels</a>. Its first release, a six-track <a href="How%20to%20Destroy%20Angels%20%28How%20to%20Destroy%20Angels%20EP%29">self-titled EP</a>, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor's next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the <a href="The%20Social%20Network%20%28soundtrack%29">official score</a> for <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a>'s 2010 film, "<a href="The%20Social%20Network">The Social Network</a>". Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a <a href="68th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">2010 Golden Globe Award</a> for <a href="68th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards%23Film">Best Original Score for a Motion Picture</a>, and a <a href="83rd%20Academy%20Awards">2010 Oscar</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Original Score</a>. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the <a href="The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo%20%28soundtrack%29">official score</a> the <a href="The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo%20%282011%20film%29">American adaptation</a> of the novel "<a href="The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>", released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher's 2014 film "<a href="Gone%20Girl%20%28film%29">Gone Girl</a>" 

In July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer <a href="Treyarch">Treyarch</a> to compose the theme music for "". Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a> on a remix of the song "Destroyer" by <a href="Telepathe">Telepathe</a>. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called "<a href="Sound%20City%20%28film%29">Sound City</a>" directed by <a href="Dave%20Grohl">Dave Grohl</a>, in addition to co-writing and performing the song "<a href="Mantra%20%28song%29">Mantra</a>" with Grohl and <a href="Josh%20Homme">Josh Homme</a>. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from <a href="Queens%20of%20the%20Stone%20Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a> titled <a href="...%20Like%20Clockwork">... Like Clockwork</a>. Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song "Kalopsia" and vocals on "Fairweather Friends" along with <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> on piano and vocals. In October a project with <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href="Beats%20Electronics">Beats Electronics</a> was announced that Reznor wrote was "probably not what you're expecting [from me]". The project was named "Daisy"; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer.

In an interview with <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails "in mind". Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the <a href="Twenty%20Thirteen%20Tour">Twenty Thirteen Tour</a>. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include <a href="Eric%20Avery">Eric Avery</a> of <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>, Adrian Belew of <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>, and <a href="Joshua%20Eustis">Josh Eustis</a> of <a href="Telefon%20Tel%20Aviv">Telefon Tel Aviv</a>, as well as returning members <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a> and <a href="Ilan%20Rubin">Ilan Rubin</a>. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place.

By May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, "<a href="Hesitation%20Marks">Hesitation Marks</a>" incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist <a href="Pino%20Palladino">Pino Palladino</a> along with <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> and <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s <a href="Lindsey%20Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a> to achieve various <a href="art-rock">art-rock</a> elements.

The album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. "<a href="Came%20Back%20Haunted">Came Back Haunted</a>" was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an <a href="epileptic%20seizure">epileptic seizure</a> warning. The second single, "<a href="Copy%20of%20A">Copy of A</a>", was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> account holders. "<a href="Everything%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Everything</a>" was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails <a href="greatest%20hits%20album">greatest hits album</a>. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album.

In July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the <a href="Fuji%20Rock%20Festival">Fuji Rock Festival</a>, and the <a href="Pukkelpop">Pukkelpop</a>, <a href="Hockenheim">Hockenheim, Germany</a>'s Rock'n'Heim and the <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds">Reading and Leeds</a> festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, <a href="Lisa%20Fischer">Lisa Fischer</a> and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with <a href="Godspeed%20You%21%20Black%20Emperor">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> and <a href="Explosions%20in%20the%20Sky">Explosions in the Sky</a> as <a href="opening%20act">opening act</a>s. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as "Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013".

In 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by <a href="Queens%20of%20the%20Stone%20Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a> for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act <a href="Cold%20Cave">Cold Cave</a>.

After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group <a href="Death%20Grips">Death Grips</a> scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks into the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. <a href="Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, <a href="The%20Dillinger%20Escape%20Plan">The Dillinger Escape Plan</a> and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the remainder of the tour.

In 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted.

In June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of "The Fragile" and "With Teeth" to stream exclusively on <a href="Apple%20Music">Apple Music</a>, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started "messing around with some things" in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating "It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting". In December 2015, Reznor reported that "Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016".

In October 2016, in response to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: "Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? ... Just wait and see what happens." Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled "<a href="Not%20the%20Actual%20Events">Not the Actual Events</a>", along with reissues of "Broken", "The Downward Spiral", and "The Fragile," with subsequent reissues of "With Teeth", "Year Zero", and "The Slip" to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was "The Fragile: Deviations 1", which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. "Not the Actual Events" was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a> was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.

In early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the <a href="Panorama%20Music%20Festival">Panorama Music Festival</a> in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page that it would be headlining Day 3 of <a href="FYF%20Fest">FYF Fest</a> in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced its 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band's 2014 touring lineup, <a href="Robin%20Finck">Robin Finck</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a>, and <a href="Ilan%20Rubin">Ilan Rubin</a>.

In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that "Not the Actual Events" would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment "<a href="Add%20Violence">Add Violence</a>" being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single "<a href="Less%20Than%20%28song%29">Less Than</a>" was released a week prior to the second EP's release.

Also in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming <a href="Ken%20Burns">Ken Burns</a> series "<a href="The%20Vietnam%20War%20%28film%29">The Vietnam War</a>", and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for "<a href="The%20Social%20Network%20%28soundtrack%29">The Social Network</a>" and "<a href="The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo%20%28soundtrack%29">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>". 

In May 2018, the band revealed its ninth studio album, entitled "<a href="Bad%20Witch">Bad Witch</a>", which was released on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the "Cold and Black and Infinite North America 2018 Tour", where it will be touring with <a href="The%20Jesus%20and%20Mary%20Chain">The Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. To prevent <a href="Ticket%20resale">ticket scalping</a>, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision "The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We've decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way."

There are several music genres Nine Inch Nails has been described as, including <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a>, <a href="industrial%20dance">industrial dance</a>, <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a>, <a href="electro-industrial">electro-industrial</a>, <a href="industrial%20metal">industrial metal</a>, and <a href="electronic%20rock">electronic rock</a>. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey states that "Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as <a href="Throbbing%20Gristle">Throbbing Gristle</a> and <a href="Test%20Dept.">Test Dept.</a> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in "Spin" magazine that "<a href="Down%20in%20It">Down in It</a>" was influenced by early <a href="Skinny%20Puppy">Skinny Puppy</a>, particularly the band's song "<a href="Dig%20It%20%28Skinny%20Puppy%20song%29">Dig It</a>"; other songs from "Pretty Hate Machine" and "With Teeth" have been described as <a href="synth-pop">synth-pop</a>. Reviewing "<a href="The%20Fragile%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20album%29">The Fragile</a>", critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in "The Frail" and <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a> elements in "<a href="Starfuckers%2C%20Inc.">Starfuckers, Inc.</a>" <a href="Ambient%20music">Ambient music</a> has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on "Ghosts I–IV" (which is specifically <a href="dark%20ambient">dark ambient</a>), "Hesitation Marks", "The Downward Spiral", "The Slip", and "The Fragile".
Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as "<a href="Wish%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Wish</a>", and "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20World%20Went%20Away">The Day the World Went Away</a>" exhibit terraced <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in "Starfuckers, Inc." and "<a href="Burn%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Burn</a>". The band's music also occasionally contains complex <a href="time%20signatures">time signatures</a>, notably in "The Collector", from "With Teeth", and concert favorite "<a href="March%20of%20the%20Pigs">March of the Pigs</a>". Reznor regularly uses <a href="noise%20%28audio%29">noise</a> and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a> with <a href="chromatic">chromatic</a> melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song "<a href="Hurt%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Hurt</a>", which contains a highly dissonant <a href="tritone">tritone</a> played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the <a href="eleventh">eleventh</a> note on the word "I" every time the B/E# <a href="dyad%20%28music%29">dyad</a> is played. "<a href="Closer%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Closer</a>" concludes with a chromatic piano <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>: The melody is debuted during the second verse of "<a href="Piggy%20%28song%29">Piggy</a>" on organ, then reappears in power chords at <a href="drop%20D%20tuning">drop D tuning</a> throughout the chorus of "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on "The Downward Spiral". On "The Fragile", Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28album%29">Year Zero</a>" contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long "The Great Destroyer". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: "guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken."

Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, <a href="nihilism">nihilism</a>, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in "Year Zero". Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s: "The Downward Spiral", follow-up "The Fragile", and the aforementioned "Year Zero". "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>" (under the working title "Bleedthrough") was to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.

Nine Inch Nails' earliest influences include <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a> and <a href="Skinny%20Puppy">Skinny Puppy</a>, which helped shape what became 1989's "Pretty Hate Machine". The album's liner notes also paid tribute to the hip-hop group <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a> and <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>. Another large influence on the band's sound is <a href="Gary%20Numan">Gary Numan</a>, which is evident as Reznor once said that "after hearing '<a href="Cars%20%28song%29">Cars</a>' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers". The 2005 single "<a href="Only%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Only</a>" exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>, <a href="Devo">Devo</a>, <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>, <a href="Adam%20Ant">Adam Ant</a>, and <a href="Soft%20Cell">Soft Cell</a>.

Reznor has toured with some of his influences, including a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1988. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, who, along with <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, had been a significant influence on "<a href="The%20Downward%20Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a>".

Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from his initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way". Following the release of "The Downward Spiral", mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared Reznor's impact to that of <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a>. Bob Ezrin, producer for <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>, <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>, described Reznor in 2007 as a "true visionary" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. Nine Inch Nails has been credited by music journalists for popularizing industrial music, despite ambivalence from Reznor.

The act has received four awards from 25 nominations, including two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s for the songs "<a href="Wish%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Wish</a>" and "<a href="Happiness%20in%20Slavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>" in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Nine Inch Nails have received two <a href="Kerrang%21%20Awards">"Kerrang!" Awards</a>; one of them being the "Kerrang!" Icon in 2006, honoring the band's overall contributions since 1988 and long-standing influence on rock music. The band has also received nine nominations from the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a> for several of its videos, including two nominations for the "Closer" music video and five nominations for "The Perfect Drug" music video, including <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Video%20of%20the%20Year">Video of the Year</a>.

In 1997, Reznor appeared in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and "Spin" described him as "the most vital artist in music". The <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States, which accounted for roughly half of the band's reported sales worldwide at that time. In 2003, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine placed "The Downward Spiral" at No. 200 in a 2003 list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>", and by the following year ranked Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 in their "The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time" list.

Until Atticus Ross joined in 2016, Reznor was the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, Reznor typically forms a backing group of musicians to perform the songs in a live setting. This live band, also known as Nine Inch Nails, rearranges the band's studio catalog and creates a different sound than that of Reznor's studio recordings. Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor.

The <a href="Tapeworm%20%28band%29">Tapeworm</a> project was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more "democratic" creative environment. The band initially included live band members <a href="Danny%20Lohner">Danny Lohner</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Clouser">Charlie Clouser</a>, but eventually expanded to include other frequent Nine Inch Nails contributors <a href="Josh%20Freese">Josh Freese</a>, <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a>. However, after 9 years of studio sessions, no material was ever officially released from the group, and it was confirmed to be no longer active in 2005.

The lineup of the live band had a tendency to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.

Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly the influence that music businesses have exerted upon his creative freedom. Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several music industry corporations, culminating in Reznor's decision to proceed as an independent artist who does not employ the financial backing of the music industry to fund his creative output.

In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own <a href="Nothing%20Records">Nothing Records</a> imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.

At the behest of <a href="Prudential%20Financial">Prudential Securities</a> bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including "Pretty Hate Machine", and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. <a href="Rykodisc">Rykodisc</a>, which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print "Pretty Hate Machine" CD on November 22, 2005. Ryko also reissued the "Head Like a Hole" CD and a vinyl edition of "Pretty Hate Machine" in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for "The Downward Spiral". They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.

In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a> (parent company of Nine Inch Nails' record label, <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>) for its pricing and distribution plans for "Year Zero." He labeled the company's retail pricing of "Year Zero" in Australia as "ABSURD", concluding that "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off". Reznor went on to say that he hated Interscope, and in later years the "climate" of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealing".

Reznor announced on October 8, 2007, that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a "totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label". Reznor also speculated that he would release the next Nine Inch Nails album online in a similar fashion to "<a href="The%20Inevitable%20Rise%20and%20Liberation%20of%20NiggyTardust%21">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</a>", which he produced. Reznor later released the first nine tracks of "<a href="Ghosts%20I%E2%80%93IV">Ghosts I–IV</a>" and the entirety of "<a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29">The Slip</a>" in 2008 for free download.

In another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential "accusation", in Reznor's words, "that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for". Reznor wrote in response that he was "challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other's feet". Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched in November 2007.

Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Awards">MTV Movie Awards</a>, but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> as a backdrop to the band's performance of "<a href="The%20Hand%20That%20Feeds">The Hand That Feeds</a>". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: "Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me." MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements". A performance by <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a> replaced Nine Inch Nails' time slot on the show. During the "Lights in the Sky" tour in 2008, some performances of "The Hand that Feeds" had the image of Bush on a video screen behind the band. At some gigs leading up to the election, the face of Bush slowly morphed during the song into the face of <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>.

In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> to <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a> for using three songs from "The Fragile" on air without permission. The songs "La Mer", "The Great Below", and "The Mark Has Been Made" appeared in an episode of "<a href="War%20Stories%20with%20Oliver%20North">War Stories with Oliver North</a>" detailing the <a href="battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">battle of Iwo Jima</a>. A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up. A cease and desist has been issued. FUCK Fox Fucking News."

As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of "Year Zero", three tracks from the album were intentionally "leaked" prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on <a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB flash drive</a>s. The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>, despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label. The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, "These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."

The music of Nine Inch Nails has reportedly been used by the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">U.S. military</a> as <a href="music%20torture">music torture</a> to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message on the front page of the Nine Inch Nails website: "It's difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration's reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us."

Aside from disagreements over the usage of Nine Inch Nails material, some corporations have dismissed content due to perceived obscenity. In 2009, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> rejected an update to Nine Inch Nails' <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> application, "NIN: Access", because it found "The Downward Spiral" to contain "offensive or obscene content", referring to the lyrical content. Reznor criticized their decision, citing the audio was also available through the <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> application.

A similar incident involving digital content distribution occurred in 2013 when Nine Inch Nails re-released the original 1993 film "<a href="Broken%20%281993%20film%29">Broken</a>" on <a href="Vimeo">Vimeo</a>. Within hours of launch, the video was removed due to a terms of service violation on material that "harass, incite hatred or depict excessive violence".





Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for 13 <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> and has won awards on two occasions—for "<a href="Wish%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20song%29">Wish</a>" in 1992 and "<a href="Happiness%20in%20Slavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>" in 1995:

Uncle Tom's Cabin

Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly, is an <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-slavery</a> novel by <a href="American%20literature">American author</a> <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>. Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward African Americans and <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> in the U.S. and is said to have "helped lay the groundwork for the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>".

Stowe, a <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>-born teacher at the <a href="Hartford%20Female%20Seminary">Hartford Female Seminary</a> and an active <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>, featured the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black <a href="slave">slave</a> around whom the stories of other characters revolve. The <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental novel</a> depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that <a href="Christian%20love">Christian love</a> can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow human beings.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible. It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States; one million copies in Great Britain. In 1855, three years after it was published, it was called "the most popular novel of our day." The impact attributed to the book is great, reinforced by a story that when <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> met Stowe at the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Lincoln declared, "So this is the little lady who started this great war." The quote is
<a href="wikt%3Aapocryphal">apocryphal</a>; it did not appear in print until 1896, and it has been argued that "The long-term durability of Lincoln's greeting as an anecdote in literary studies and Stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the desire among many contemporary intellectuals ... to affirm the role of literature as an agent of social change."

The book and the plays it inspired helped popularize a number of <a href="Ethnic%20stereotype">stereotypes</a> about <a href="black%20people">black people</a>. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned "<a href="mammy%20archetype">mammy</a>"; the "<a href="pickaninny">pickaninny</a>" stereotype of black children; and the "<a href="Uncle%20Tom">Uncle Tom</a>", or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with "Uncle Tom's Cabin" have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book as a "vital antislavery tool."

Stowe, a <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>-born teacher at the <a href="Hartford%20Female%20Seminary">Hartford Female Seminary</a> and an active abolitionist, wrote the novel as a response to the passage, in 1850, of the second <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act</a>. Much of the book was composed in <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Maine">Brunswick, Maine</a>, where her husband, <a href="Calvin%20Ellis%20Stowe">Calvin Ellis Stowe</a>, taught at his alma mater, <a href="Bowdoin%20College">Bowdoin College</a>.

Stowe was partly inspired to create "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> "<a href="The%20Life%20of%20Josiah%20Henson%2C%20Formerly%20a%20Slave%2C%20Now%20an%20Inhabitant%20of%20Canada%2C%20as%20Narrated%20by%20Himself">The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself</a>" (1849). <a href="Josiah%20Henson">Henson</a>, a formerly enslaved black man, had lived and worked on a 3,700-acre (15 km) tobacco <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> in <a href="North%20Bethesda%2C%20Maryland">North Bethesda, Maryland</a>, owned by Isaac Riley. Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the <a href="Upper%20Canada">Province of Upper Canada</a> (now <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Stowe acknowledged in 1853 that Henson's writings inspired "Uncle Tom's Cabin". When Stowe's work became a best-seller, Henson republished his memoirs as "The Memoirs of Uncle Tom" and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the United States and Europe. Stowe's novel lent its name to Henson's home—<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin%20Historic%20Site">Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site</a>, near <a href="Dresden%2C%20Ontario">Dresden, Ontario</a>, Canada—which since the 1940s has been a museum. The cabin where Henson lived while he was enslaved no longer exists, but a cabin on the Riley farm erroneously thought to be the Henson Cabin was purchased by the <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County, Maryland</a>, government in 2006. It is now a part of the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program, and plans are underway to build a museum and interpretive center on the site.

"", a volume co-authored by <a href="Theodore%20Dwight%20Weld">Theodore Dwight Weld</a> and the <a href="Grimk%C3%A9%20sisters">Grimké sisters</a>, is also a source of some of the novel's content. Stowe said she based the novel on a number of interviews with people who escaped slavery during the time when she was living in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, across the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, a slave state. In Cincinnati the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South.

Stowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in "<a href="A%20Key%20to%20Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery. However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published her novel.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" first appeared as a 40-week serial in "<a href="The%20National%20Era">The National Era</a>", an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run for only a few weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the "Era" office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher <a href="John%20P.%20Jewett">John P. Jewett</a> contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in book form, she eventually consented to the request.

Convinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by <a href="Hammatt%20Billings">Hammatt Billings</a> engraved for the first printing. Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000 copies on that day alone, and soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).

In the first year of publication, 300,000 copies of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" were sold. At that point, however, "demand came to an unexpected halt... No more copies were produced for many years, and if, as is claimed, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> greeted Stowe in 1862 as 'the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war,' the work had effectively been out of print for many years." Jewett went out of business, and it was not until <a href="Ticknor%20and%20Fields">Ticknor and Fields</a> put the work back in print in November 1862 that demand began again to increase.

The book was translated into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible. A number of the early editions carried an introduction by <a href="James%20Sherman%20%28minister%29">Rev James Sherman</a>, a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational</a> minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies. In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were <a href="copyright%20infringement">infringing</a> copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).

The book opens with a <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.

When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already <a href="miscarriage">miscarried</a> two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.

Tom is sold and placed on a <a href="riverboat">riverboat</a> which sets sail down the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. While on board, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named Eva. Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys Tom from the slave trader and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.

During Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> settlement for medical treatment.

Back in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.

After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of <a href="heaven">heaven</a>, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.

Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, however, he dies after being stabbed outside of a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree (a transplanted northerner) takes Tom and Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time) to rural <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, where they meet Legree's other slaves.

Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.

At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also obtained their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.

On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister and accompany her to Canada. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom's sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.

Uncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble, long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years, however, his name has become an epithet directed towards African-Americans who are accused of <a href="selling%20out">selling out</a> to whites. Stowe intended Tom to be a "noble hero" and praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, Tom stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies.

Eliza is a slave and personal maid to Mrs. Shelby who escapes to the North with her five-year-old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and emigrates with them to Canada, then France and finally Liberia.

The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at <a href="Lane%20Theological%20Seminary">Lane Theological Seminary</a> in Cincinnati by <a href="John%20Rankin%20%28abolitionist%29">John Rankin</a> to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February 1838 a young slave woman, Eliza Harris, had escaped across the frozen <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> to the town of <a href="Ripley%2C%20Ohio">Ripley</a> with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north.

Evangeline St. Clare is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when Uncle Tom is traveling via <a href="steamship">steamship</a> to New Orleans to be sold, and he rescues the five- or six-year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare house. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva.
Eva often talks about love and forgiveness, convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love. She even touches the heart of her Aunt Ophelia.

Eventually Eva falls <a href="terminal%20illness">terminally ill</a>. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become Christians so that they may see each other in <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.

A similar character, also named Little Eva, later appeared in the <a href="Children%27s%20literature">children's novel</a> "" by Philip J. Cozans—although this ironically was an <a href="Anti-Tom%20literature">anti-Tom novel</a>.

Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose name has become synonymous with greed. He is arguably the novel's main <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his religious faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.

It is unclear if Legree is based on any actual individuals. Reports surfaced after the 1870s that Stowe had in mind a wealthy cotton and sugar plantation owner named <a href="Meredith%20Calhoun">Meredith Calhoun</a>, who settled on the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red River</a> north of <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Louisiana">Alexandria, Louisiana</a>. Generally, however, the personal characteristics of Calhoun ("highly educated and refined") do not match the uncouthness and brutality of Legree. Calhoun even edited his own newspaper, published in <a href="Colfax%2C%20Louisiana">Colfax</a> (originally "Calhoun's Landing"), which was renamed "The National Democrat" after Calhoun's death. However, Calhoun's overseers may have been in line with the hated Legree's methods and motivations.

These are the more notable of the secondary and minor characters in "Uncle Tom's Cabin":


"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery. While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a> of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity, she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a "<a href="homily">homily</a>" on the destructive nature of slavery (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, "The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections—the separating of families, for example."). One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how this "peculiar institution" forcibly separated families from each other. One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. One other example is the death of the slave woman Prue who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.

Because Stowe saw motherhood as the "ethical and structural model for all of American life" and also believed that only women had the <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a> to save the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the "ideal Christian", Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often <a href="Domestic%20worker">domestic</a> <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>s instead of realistic women, Stowe's novel "reaffirmed the importance of women's influence" and helped pave the way for the <a href="women%27s%20rights%20movement">women's rights movement</a> in the following decades.

Stowe's <a href="puritan">puritan</a>ical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme—the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how she feels <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian theology</a> is <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20slavery">fundamentally incompatible</a> with slavery. This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to "look away to Jesus" after the death of St. Clare's beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, "What a thing it is to be a Christian." Because Christian themes play such a large role in "Uncle Tom's Cabin"—and because of Stowe's frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith—the novel often takes the "form of a sermon."

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is written in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th-century <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental novel</a>s and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing "Uncle Tom's Cabin". I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child." Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.

Despite this positive reaction from readers, for decades <a href="literary%20critic">literary critic</a>s dismissed the style found in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured "women's sloppy emotions." One literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, "it would be just another sentimental novel," while another described the book as "primarily a derivative piece of hack work." In "The Literary History of the United States", George F. Whicher called "Uncle Tom's Cabin" "<a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday-school</a> fiction", full of "broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos."

However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" with her book "In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction." Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including "Uncle Tom's Cabin", were remarkable for their "intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness"; and that "Uncle Tom's Cabin" offers a "critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Hawthorne</a> and <a href="Herman%20Melville">Melville</a>."

This view remains the subject of dispute. Writing in 2001, legal scholar <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a> described "Uncle Tom's Cabin" as part of the mediocre list of canonical works that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" outraged people in the <a href="American%20South">American South</a>. The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters.

Acclaimed Southern novelist <a href="William%20Gilmore%20Simms">William Gilmore Simms</a> declared the work utterly false, while others called the novel criminal and slanderous. Reactions ranged from a bookseller in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, being forced to leave town for selling the novel to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.

Some critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never been to a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that "She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot."

In response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published "<a href="A%20Key%20to%20Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>", an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and cites "real life equivalents" to them while also mounting a more "aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had." Like the novel, "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin" was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin" documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel. A major part of the "Key" was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial. This continued an important theme of "Uncle Tom's Cabin"—that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.

Despite these criticisms, the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, "So this is the little lady who started this great war." Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> <a href="General%20officer">general</a> and politician <a href="James%20Baird%20Weaver">James Baird Weaver</a> said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, "The evil passions which "Uncle Tom" gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our <a href="Tory">Tories</a> hate her democrats—our <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a> hate her <a href="parvenu">parvenu</a>s—our <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radicals</a> hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Adams%2C%20Sr.">Charles Francis Adams</a>, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"; or "Life among the Lowly", published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed."

A French edition, translated by M. L. Carion (or by [Anne-]Louise Swanton-Belloc?, 1796–1881), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had been translated into 20 languages, including two independent translations into <a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene</a> just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator <a href="Lin%20Shu">Lin Shu</a> creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and <a href="Amharic%20language">Amharic</a> (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> reported a number of patients with <a href="Sadomasochism">sado-masochistic</a> tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in "Uncle Tom's Cabin". A short article which was published in the oficial newspaper of the <a href="El%20Salvador">Salvadoran</a> government in July 22, 1853 praised Harriet Beecher Stowe and her book's success.

As the first widely read <a href="political%20fiction">political novel</a> in the United States, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" greatly influenced development of not only <a href="American%20literature">American literature</a> but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to "Uncle Tom's Cabin" include "<a href="The%20Jungle">The Jungle</a>" by <a href="Upton%20Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a> and "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>" by <a href="Rachel%20Carson">Rachel Carson</a>.
Despite this undisputed significance, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" has been called "a blend of children's <a href="fable">fable</a> and propaganda." The novel has also been dismissed by a number of <a href="literary%20critics">literary critics</a> as "merely a sentimental novel," while critic George Whicher stated in his "Literary History of the United States" that "Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book."
Other critics, though, have praised the novel. <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> stated that "To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may ... prove a startling experience." Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day.

Over the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>'s: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.

Scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the <a href="Free%20Soil">Free Will Movement</a>. In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the <a href="U.S.%20Republican%20Party">Republican Party</a> (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.

<a href="Feminist%20theory">Feminist theory</a> can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the <a href="patriarchal">patriarchal</a> nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.

The book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a> as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery. In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.

Some modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for supposedly condescending racist descriptions of the black characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common <a href="stereotypes">stereotypes</a> about African Americans is significant because "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) was accused of playing a major role in permanently ingraining such stereotypes into the American psyche. In the 1960s and 1970s, the <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> and <a href="Black%20Arts%20Movement">Black Arts Movement</a>s attacked the novel, claiming that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in "race betrayal", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners.

Among the <a href="African-American%20stereotypes">stereotypes of blacks</a> in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" are the "happy darky" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned <a href="tragic%20mulatto">tragic mulatto</a> as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female <a href="mammy%20archetype">mammy</a> (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the <a href="pickaninny">pickaninny</a> stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a "noble hero" and a Christ-like figure who, like Jesus at his crucifixion, forgives the people responsible for his death. The false stereotype of Tom as a "subservient fool who bows down to the white man", and the resulting derogatory term "Uncle Tom", resulted from staged "<a href="Tom%20Shows">Tom Shows</a>", which replaced Tom's grim death with an upbeat ending where Tom causes his oppressors to see the error of their ways, and they all reconcile happily. Stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story.

These negative associations have to some extent obscured the historical impact of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" as a "vital antislavery tool". <a href="James%20Baldwin%20%28writer%29">James Baldwin</a>, in a 1949 essay "Everybody's Protest Novel", called "Uncle Tom's Cabin" a "very bad novel" ... "ruined by its "self-righteous, virtuous sentimentality", and stated that Stowe was less a novelist than an "impassioned pamphleteer", i.e., a propagandist for the antislavery cause. <a href="Edward%20Rothstein">Edward Rothstein</a> has claimed that Baldwin missed the point and that the purpose of the novel was "to treat slavery not as a political issue but as an individually human one – and ultimately a challenge to Christianity itself"; as a propaganda work it need not necessarily be great literature in order to succeed in its goals.

In recent years, however, scholars such as <a href="Henry%20Louis%20Gates%20Jr.">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a> have re-examined "Uncle Tom's Cabin", stating that the book is a "central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations".

In response to "Uncle Tom's Cabin", writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called <a href="Anti-Tom%20literature">Anti-Tom literature</a> generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.

Among the most famous anti-Tom books are "<a href="The%20Sword%20and%20the%20Distaff">The Sword and the Distaff</a>" by <a href="William%20Gilmore%20Simms">William Gilmore Simms</a>, "<a href="Aunt%20Phillis%27s%20Cabin">Aunt Phillis's Cabin</a>" by <a href="Mary%20Henderson%20Eastman">Mary Henderson Eastman</a>, and "<a href="The%20Planter%27s%20Northern%20Bride">The Planter's Northern Bride</a>" by <a href="Caroline%20Lee%20Hentz">Caroline Lee Hentz</a>, with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.

In the decade between the publication of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled "Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is" (one by W. L. Smith and the other by C. H. Wiley) and a book by <a href="John%20Pendleton%20Kennedy">John Pendleton Kennedy</a>. More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one point about the "Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman."

Even though "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book. Eric Lott, in his book "Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production", estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales.

Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on "Uncle Tom's Cabin"—"Tom shows"—began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see <a href="George%20Aiken%20%28playwright%29">George L. Aiken</a>'s version and, according to Francis Underwood, was "delighted" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy). Aiken's stage production was the most popular play in the U.S. and England for 75 years. Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.

No <a href="international%20copyright">international copyright</a> laws existed at the time. The book and plays were translated into several languages; Stowe received no money, which could have meant as much as "three-fourths of her just and legitimate wages."

All of the Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> and <a href="blackface">blackface</a> <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrelsy</a>. These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people, while a number of productions also featured songs by <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a> (including "<a href="My%20Old%20Kentucky%20Home">My Old Kentucky Home</a>", "<a href="Old%20Folks%20at%20Home">Old Folks at Home</a>", and "Massa's in the Cold Ground"). The best-known Tom Shows were those of <a href="George%20Aiken%20%28playwright%29">George Aiken</a> and H.J. Conway.

The version by Aiken is perhaps the best known stage adaptation, released just a few months after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue was taken verbatim from Stowe's novel, and his adaptation included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of Aiken's version is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.

The many stage variants of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" "dominated northern popular culture... for several years" during the 19th century, and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century.

One of the unique and controversial variants of the Tom Shows was Walt Disney's "<a href="Mickey%27s%20Mellerdrammer">Mickey's Mellerdrammer</a>", a <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> film <a href="1933%20in%20film">released in 1933</a>. The title is a corruption of "melodrama", thought to harken back to the earliest <a href="minstrel%20shows">minstrel shows</a>, as a film short based on a production of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by the <a href="Disney">Disney</a> characters. In that film, <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and friends stage their own production of "Uncle Tom's Cabin".
Mickey Mouse was already black-colored, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey dressed in <a href="blackface">blackface</a> with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his trademark white gloves.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" has been adapted several times as a film. Most of these movies were created during the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> era ("Uncle Tom's Cabin" was the most-filmed book of that time period). Because of the continuing popularity of both the book and "Tom" shows, audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words. There has been no Hollywood treatment since the end of the silent era.

The first film version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was one of the earliest full-length movies (although full-length at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes). This 1903 film, directed by <a href="Edwin%20S.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a>, used white actors in <a href="blackface">blackface</a> in the major roles and black performers only as <a href="Extra%20%28actor%29">extras</a>. This version was evidently similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured numerous stereotypes about blacks (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).

In 1910, a three-reel <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Company of America</a> production was directed by <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a> and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to "The Dramatic Mirror", this film was "a decided innovation" in motion pictures and "the first time an American company" released a dramatic film in three reels. Until then, full-length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred <a href="Florence%20Turner">Florence Turner</a>, <a href="Mary%20Fuller">Mary Fuller</a>, Edwin R. Phillips, <a href="Flora%20Finch">Flora Finch</a>, <a href="Genevieve%20Tobin">Genevieve Tobin</a> and <a href="Carlyle%20Blackwell">Carlyle Blackwell</a>, Sr.

At least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version was released in 1927. Directed by <a href="Harry%20A.%20Pollard">Harry A. Pollard</a> (who played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of "Uncle Tom's Cabin"), this two-hour movie was more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). The black actor <a href="Charles%20Sidney%20Gilpin">Charles Gilpin</a> was originally cast in the title role, but he was fired after the studio decided his "portrayal was too aggressive." <a href="James%20B.%20Lowe">James B. Lowe</a> took over the character of Tom. The screenplay takes many liberties with the original book, including altering the Eliza and George subplot, introducing the Civil War and Emancipation, and combining the characters of Eliza and Emmeline. Another difference occurs after Tom dies: Simon Legree is haunted by an apparitional vision of the late Tom and falls to his death in a futile effort to attack the ghostly image.

Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio—fearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences—ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening sequence at a slave auction (in which a mother is torn away from her baby). The story was adapted by Harvey F. Pollard, "Thew" and <a href="A.%20P.%20Younger">A. P. Younger</a>, with titles by <a href="Walter%20Anthony">Walter Anthony</a>. It starred James B. Lowe, <a href="Virginia%20Grey">Virginia Grey</a>, <a href="George%20Siegmann">George Siegmann</a>, <a href="Margarita%20Fischer">Margarita Fischer</a>, <a href="Mona%20Ray">Mona Ray</a> and <a href="Madame%20Sul-Te-Wan">Madame Sul-Te-Wan</a>.

For several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>.

A German-language version, "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin%20%281965%20film%29">Onkel Toms Hütte</a>", directed by Géza von Radványi, was released in 1965 and was presented in the United States by <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a> presenter <a href="Kroger%20Babb">Kroger Babb</a>.

The most recent film version was a <a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin%20%281987%20film%29">television broadcast in 1987</a>, directed by <a href="Stan%20Lathan">Stan Lathan</a> and adapted by John Gay. It starred <a href="Avery%20Brooks">Avery Brooks</a>, <a href="Phylicia%20Rashad">Phylicia Rashad</a>, <a href="Edward%20Woodward">Edward Woodward</a>, <a href="Jenny%20Lewis">Jenny Lewis</a>, <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> and Endyia Kinney.

In addition to film adaptations, versions of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" have been produced in other formats. In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the adapted version "A Cabana do Pai Tomás" was produced as a TV soap opera by <a href="Rede%20Globo">Rede Globo</a>; with 205 episodes, it was aired from July 1969 to March 1970.

Versions of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" were featured in a number of <a href="animated%20cartoon">animated cartoon</a>s, including <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s "<a href="Mickey%27s%20Mellerdrammer">Mickey's Mellerdrammer</a>" (1933), which features <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> performing the play in <a href="blackface">blackface</a> with large orange lips; "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Bungalow">Uncle Tom's Bungalow</a>" (1937), a Warner Brother's cartoon supervised by <a href="Tex%20Avery">Tex Avery</a>; "Eliza on Ice" (1944), one of the earliest <a href="Mighty%20Mouse">Mighty Mouse</a> cartoons produced by <a href="Paul%20Terry%20%28cartoonist%29">Paul Terry</a>; "Uncle Tom's Cabana" (1947), a six-minute cartoon directed by <a href="Tex%20Avery">Tex Avery</a>, and the <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> cartoon "<a href="Southern%20Fried%20Rabbit">Southern Fried Rabbit</a>" (1953), wherein Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom and sings "<a href="My%20Old%20Kentucky%20Home">My Old Kentucky Home</a>" in order to cross the <a href="Mason-Dixon%20line">Mason-Dixon line</a>.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" has influenced numerous movies, including "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a>". This controversial 1915 film set the dramatic climax in a slave cabin similar to that of Uncle Tom, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend, according to the film's caption, their "<a href="Aryan%20race">Aryan</a> birthright." According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar image of a slave cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.

Gabriel Fauré

Gabriel Urbain Fauré (; 12 May 1845 – 4 November 1924) was a French composer, organist, pianist and teacher. He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his "<a href="Pavane%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Pavane</a>", <a href="Requiem%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a>, "<a href="Sicilienne%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Sicilienne</a>", <a href="Faur%C3%A9%20Nocturnes">nocturnes</a> for piano and the songs <a href="Trois%20m%C3%A9lodies%2C%20Op.7%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">"Après un rêve"</a> and <a href="Clair%20de%20lune%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">"Clair de lune"</a>. Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more <a href="harmony">harmonically</a> and <a href="melody">melodically</a> complex style.

Fauré was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to a music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Fauré earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the <a href="%C3%89glise%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Église de la Madeleine</a> and director of the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Paris Conservatoire</a>, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Fauré was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French Republic</a>. Outside France, Fauré's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.

Fauré's music has been described as linking the end of <a href="Romantic%20music">Romanticism</a> with the <a href="modernism%20%28music%29">modernism</a> of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, <a href="Chopin">Chopin</a> was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and the <a href="atonality">atonal</a> music of the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a> were being heard. The "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.

Fauré was born in <a href="Pamiers">Pamiers</a>, <a href="Ari%C3%A8ge%20%28department%29">Ariège</a>, <a href="Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es">Midi-Pyrénées</a>, in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honoré Fauré (1810–85) and Marie-Antoinette-Hélène Lalène-Laprade (1809–87). According to the biographer <a href="Jean-Michel%20Nectoux">Jean-Michel Nectoux</a>, the Fauré family dates to the 13th century in that part of France. The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced. The composer's paternal grandfather, Gabriel, was a butcher whose son became a schoolmaster. In 1829 Fauré's parents married. His mother was the daughter of a minor member of the nobility. He was the only one of the six children to display musical talent; his four brothers pursued careers in journalism, politics, the army and the civil service, and his sister had a traditional life as the wife of a public servant.

The young Fauré was sent to live with a foster mother until he was four years old. When his father was appointed director of the École Normale d'Instituteurs, a teacher training college, at Montgauzy, near <a href="Foix">Foix</a>, in 1849, Fauré returned to live with his family. There was a chapel attached to the school, which Fauré recalled in the last year of his life:

An old blind woman, who came to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20France">National Assembly</a>, heard Fauré play and advised Toussaint-Honoré to send him to the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music), better known as the , which <a href="Louis%20Niedermeyer">Louis Niedermeyer</a> was setting up in Paris. After reflecting for a year, Fauré's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.

Helped by a scholarship from the bishop of his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Fauré's tutors were <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment%20Loret">Clément Loret</a> for organ, <a href="Pierre-Louis%20Dietsch">Louis Dietsch</a> for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and <a href="fugue">fugue</a>, and Niedermeyer for piano, <a href="plainsong">plainsong</a> and composition.

When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> took charge of piano studies and introduced contemporary music, including that of <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>. Fauré recalled in old age, "After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life."

Saint-Saëns took great pleasure in his pupil's progress, which he helped whenever he could; Nectoux comments that at each step in Fauré's career "Saint-Saëns's shadow can effectively be taken for granted." The close friendship between them lasted until Saint-Saëns died sixty years later. Fauré won many prizes while at the school, including a "premier prix" in composition for the "<a href="Cantique%20de%20Jean%20Racine%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Cantique de Jean Racine</a>", Op. 11, the earliest of his choral works to enter the regular repertory. He left the school in July 1865, as a "Laureat" in organ, piano, harmony and composition, with a "Maître de Chapelle" diploma.

On leaving the École Niedermeyer, Fauré was appointed organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at <a href="Rennes">Rennes</a> in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>. He took up the post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving "countless piano lessons". At Saint-Saëns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Fauré's religious conviction. Fauré was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for a cigarette, and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, he was asked to resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Saëns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of <a href="Notre-Dame%20de%20Clignancourt">Notre-Dame de Clignancourt</a>, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the <a href="Siege%20of%20Paris%20%281870-1871%29">Siege of Paris</a>, and saw action at <a href="Battle%20of%20Le%20Bourget">Le Bourget</a>, <a href="Champigny%2C%20Marne">Champigny</a> and <a href="Cr%C3%A9teil">Créteil</a>. He was awarded a "Croix de Guerre".
After France's defeat by <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, there was a brief, bloody conflict within Paris from March to May 1871 during the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Commune</a>. Fauré escaped to <a href="Rambouillet">Rambouillet</a> where one of his brothers lived, and then travelled to Switzerland, where he took up a teaching post at the École Niedermeyer, which had temporarily relocated there to avoid the violence in Paris. His first pupil at the school was <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>, who became a lifelong friend and occasional collaborator. Fauré's compositions from this period did not overtly reflect the turmoil and bloodshed. Some of his colleagues, including Saint-Saëns, <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a> and <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">Franck</a> produced elegies and patriotic odes. Fauré did not, but according to his biographer Jessica Duchen, his music acquired "a new sombreness, a dark-hued sense of tragedy ... evident mainly in his songs of this period including "L'Absent", "Seule!" and "La Chanson du pêcheur"."

When Fauré returned to Paris in October 1871, he was appointed choirmaster at the <a href="%C3%89glise%20Saint-Sulpice%2C%20Paris">Église Saint-Sulpice</a> under the composer and organist <a href="Charles-Marie%20Widor">Charles-Marie Widor</a>. In the course of his duties, he wrote several <a href="canticle">canticle</a>s and <a href="motet">motet</a>s, few of which have survived. During some services, Widor and Fauré improvised simultaneously at the church's two organs, trying to catch each other out with sudden changes of key. Fauré regularly attended Saint-Saëns's musical <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a> and those of <a href="Pauline%20Viardot">Pauline Viardot</a>, to whom Saint-Saëns introduced him.

Fauré was a founding member of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a>, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of <a href="Romain%20Bussine">Romain Bussine</a> and Saint-Saëns, to promote new French music. Other members included <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Georges Bizet</a>, <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Emmanuel Chabrier</a>, <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>, <a href="Henri%20Duparc%20%28composer%29">Henri Duparc</a>, César Franck, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Lalo">Édouard Lalo</a> and <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Jules Massenet</a>. Fauré became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.
In 1874 Fauré moved from Saint-Sulpice to the <a href="%C3%89glise%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Église de la Madeleine</a>, acting as deputy for the principal organist, Saint-Saëns, during the latter's many absences on tour. Some admirers of Fauré's music have expressed regret that although he played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument. He was renowned for his improvisations, and Saint-Saëns said of him that he was "a first class organist when he wanted to be". Fauré preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only because it gave him a regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because "for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough."

The year 1877 was significant for Fauré, both professionally and personally. In January his first <a href="violin%20sonata">violin sonata</a> was performed at a Société Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing career at the age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer's first great masterpiece. In March, Saint-Saëns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20Dubois">Théodore Dubois</a>, his choirmaster; Fauré was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July Fauré became engaged to Pauline Viardot's daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear. To distract Fauré, Saint-Saëns took him to <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> and introduced him to <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>. This visit gave Fauré a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged for the rest of his life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>" at the <a href="Cologne%20Opera">Cologne Opera</a>; the complete "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring</a>" cycle at the <a href="Bavarian%20State%20Opera">Hofoper</a> in Munich and at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">Her Majesty's Theatre</a> in London; and "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger</a>" in Munich and at <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a>, where they also saw "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent "Souvenirs de Bayreuth". This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from "The Ring". Fauré admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.

In 1883 Fauré married Marie Fremiet, the daughter of a leading sculptor, <a href="Emmanuel%20Fr%C3%A9miet">Emmanuel Fremiet</a>. The marriage was affectionate, but Marie became resentful of Fauré's frequent absences, his dislike of domestic life – ""horreur du domicile"" – and his love affairs, while she remained at home. Though Fauré valued Marie as a friend and confidante, writing to her often – sometimes daily – when away from home, she did not share his passionate nature, which found fulfilment elsewhere. Fauré and his wife had two sons. The first, born in 1883, <a href="Emmanuel%20Faur%C3%A9-Fremiet">Emmanuel Fauré-Fremiet</a> (Marie insisted on combining her family name with Fauré's), became a biologist of international reputation. The second son, Philippe, born in 1889, became a writer; his works included histories, plays, and biographies of his father and grandfather.

Contemporary accounts agree that Fauré was extremely attractive to women; in Duchen's phrase, "his conquests were legion in the Paris salons." After a romantic attachment to the singer <a href="Emma%20Bardac">Emma Bardac</a> from around 1892, followed by another to the composer <a href="Adela%20Maddison">Adela Maddison</a>, in 1900 Fauré met the pianist Marguerite Hasselmans, the daughter of <a href="Alphonse%20Hasselmans">Alphonse Hasselmans</a>. This led to a relationship which lasted for the rest of Fauré's life. He maintained her in a Paris apartment, and she acted openly as his companion.

To support his family, Fauré spent most of his time in running the daily services at the Madeleine and giving piano and harmony lessons. His compositions earned him a negligible amount, because his publisher bought them outright, paying him an average of 60 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> for a song, and Fauré received no royalties. During this period, he wrote several large-scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed most of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motifs. Among the works surviving from this period is the <a href="Requiem%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a>, begun in 1887 and revised and expanded, over the years, until its final version dating from 1901. After its first performance, in 1888, the priest in charge told the composer, "We don't need these novelties: the Madeleine's repertoire is quite rich enough."

As a young man Fauré had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his "youthful, even somewhat child-like, mirth." From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as "<a href="spleen%23Etymology%20and%20cultural%20views">spleen</a>", possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a> was aborted by the poet's drunken inability to deliver a libretto. Fauré was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health. <a href="Winnaretta%20Singer">Winnaretta de Scey-Montbéliard</a>, always a good friend to Fauré, invited him to <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, where she had a "<a href="palazzo">palazzo</a>" on the <a href="Grand%20Canal%20%28Venice%29">Grand Canal</a>. He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing the first of his five "<a href="Cinq%20m%C3%A9lodies%20%26quot%3Bde%20Venise%26quot%3B">Mélodies de Venise</a>", to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.
About this time, or shortly afterwards, Fauré's liaison with Emma Bardac began; in Duchen's words, "for the first time, in his late forties, he experienced a fulfilling, passionate relationship which extended over several years". His principal biographers all agree that this affair inspired a burst of creativity and a new originality in his music, exemplified in the song cycle "<a href="La%20bonne%20chanson%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">La bonne chanson</a>". Fauré wrote the "<a href="Dolly%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Dolly Suite</a>" for <a href="piano%20duet">piano duet</a> between 1894 and 1897 and dedicated it to Bardac's daughter Hélène, known as "Dolly". Some people suspected that Fauré was Dolly's father, but biographers including Nectoux and Duchen think it unlikely. Fauré's affair with Emma Bardac is thought to have begun after Dolly was born, though there is no conclusive evidence either way.

During the 1890s Fauré's fortunes improved. When <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a>, professor of composition at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Paris Conservatoire</a>, died in 1892, Saint-Saëns encouraged Fauré to apply for the vacant post. The faculty of the Conservatoire regarded Fauré as dangerously modern, and its head, <a href="Ambroise%20Thomas">Ambroise Thomas</a>, blocked the appointment, declaring, "Fauré? Never! If he's appointed, I resign." However, Fauré was appointed to another of Guiraud's posts, inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces. He disliked the prolonged travelling around the country that the work entailed, but the post gave him a steady income and enabled him to give up teaching amateur pupils.
In 1896 Ambroise Thomas died, and Théodore Dubois took over as head of the Conservatoire. Fauré succeeded Dubois as chief organist of the Madeleine. Dubois' move had further repercussions: Massenet, professor of composition at the Conservatoire, had expected to succeed Thomas, but had overplayed his hand by insisting on being appointed for life. He was turned down, and when Dubois was appointed instead, Massenet resigned his professorship in fury. Fauré was appointed in his place. He taught many young composers, including <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, <a href="Florent%20Schmitt">Florent Schmitt</a>, <a href="Charles%20Koechlin">Charles Koechlin</a>, <a href="Louis%20Aubert">Louis Aubert</a>, <a href="Jean%20Roger-Ducasse">Jean Roger-Ducasse</a>, <a href="George%20Enescu">George Enescu</a>, <a href="Paul%20Ladmirault">Paul Ladmirault</a>, <a href="Alfredo%20Casella">Alfredo Casella</a> and <a href="Nadia%20Boulanger">Nadia Boulanger</a>. In Fauré's view, his students needed a firm grounding in the basic skills, which he was happy to delegate to his capable assistant <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gedalge">André Gedalge</a>. His own part came in helping them make use of these skills in the way that suited each student's talents. Roger-Ducasse later wrote, "Taking up whatever the pupils were working on, he would evoke the rules of the form at hand ... and refer to examples, always drawn from the masters." Ravel always remembered Fauré's open-mindedness as a teacher. Having received Ravel's <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Ravel%29">String Quartet</a> with less than his usual enthusiasm, Fauré asked to see the manuscript again a few days later, saying, "I could have been wrong". The musicologist Henry Prunières wrote, "What Fauré developed among his pupils was taste, harmonic sensibility, the love of pure lines, of unexpected and colorful modulations; but he never gave them [recipes] for composing according to his style and that is why they all sought and found their own paths in many different, and often opposed, directions."

Fauré's works of the last years of the century include <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for the English premiere of <a href="Maurice%20Maeterlinck">Maurice Maeterlinck</a>'s "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20and%20M%C3%A9lisande">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" (1898) and "<a href="Prom%C3%A9th%C3%A9e">Prométhée</a>", a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at <a href="B%C3%A9ziers">Béziers</a>. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the <a href="Paris%20Opera">Paris Opéra</a> in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter.

From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>", a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the positive aspects of a work.

In 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>. Fauré's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Fauré radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Fauré was dubbed "<a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Robespierre</a>" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, "where <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Auber</a>, <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Halévy</a> and especially <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a> had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a> or even some Wagner – up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>.

Fauré's new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>" (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle "<a href="La%20chanson%20d%27%C3%88ve">La chanson d'Ève</a>", Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).
Fauré was elected to the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a> in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, <a href="Charles%20Marie%20Widor">Widor</a>. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20musicale%20ind%C3%A9pendante">Société musicale indépendante</a>. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid.

During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.

The turn of the 20th century saw a rise in the popularity of Fauré's music in Britain, and to a lesser extent in Germany, Spain and Russia. He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond. He attended the London premiere of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">First Symphony</a>, in 1908, and dined with the composer afterwards. Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend <a href="Leo%20Frank%20Schuster">Frank Schuster</a> that Fauré "was such a real gentleman – the highest kind of Frenchman and I admired him greatly." Elgar tried to get Fauré's Requiem put on at the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a>, but it did not finally have its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France. Composers from other countries also loved and admired Fauré. In the 1880s <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> had thought him "adorable"; <a href="Isaac%20Alb%C3%A9niz">Albéniz</a> and Fauré were friends and correspondents until the former's early death in 1909; <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> sought his advice; and in Fauré's last years, the young American <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> was a devoted admirer.

The outbreak of the First World War almost stranded Fauré in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France for the duration of the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Saëns. Fauré did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art "a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation." Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> for concerts of his music, he had written, "The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's no question about it, French and German are two different things."

In 1920, at the age of 75, Fauré retired from the Conservatoire because of his increasing deafness and frailty. In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, <a href="Alexandre%20Millerand">Alexandre Millerand</a>, led a public tribute to Fauré, a national "hommage", described in "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" as "a splendid celebration at the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [which] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note. He sat gazing before him pensively, and, in spite of everything, grateful and content."
Fauré suffered from poor health in his later years, brought on in part by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a>, most of whom were devoted to him. Nectoux writes, "In old age he attained a kind of serenity, without losing any of his remarkable spiritual vitality, but rather removed from the sensualism and the passion of the works he wrote between 1875 and 1895."

In his last months, Fauré struggled to complete a string quartet. Twenty years earlier he had been the dedicatee of Ravel's String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Fauré to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, on the grounds that it was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, "I've started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be "terrified" of it." He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it. The quartet was premiered after his death; he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted in his ear.

Fauré died in Paris from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on 4 November 1924 at the age of 79. He was given a state funeral at the Église de la Madeleine and is buried in the <a href="Passy%20Cemetery">Passy Cemetery</a> in Paris.

After Fauré's death, the Conservatoire abandoned his radicalism and became resistant to new trends in music, with Fauré's own harmonic practice being held up as the farthest limit of modernity, beyond which students should not go. His successor, <a href="Henri%20Rabaud">Henri Rabaud</a>, director of the Conservatoire from 1922 to 1941, declared "modernism is the enemy". The generation of students born between the wars rejected this outdated premise, turning for inspiration to <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>, the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a>, and the latest works of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>.

In a centenary tribute in 1945, the musicologist Leslie Orrey wrote in "The Musical Times", "'More profound than Saint-Saëns, more varied than Lalo, more spontaneous than d'Indy, more classic than Debussy, Gabriel Fauré is the master "par excellence" of French music, the perfect mirror of our musical genius.' Perhaps, when English musicians get to know his work better, these words of Roger-Ducasse will seem, not over-praise, but no more than his due."

<a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> wrote that although Fauré's works can be divided into the usual "early", "middle" and "late" periods, there is no such radical difference between his first and last manners as is evident with many other composers. Copland found premonitions of late Fauré in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Fauré in the works of his old age: "The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound." When Fauré was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Fauré’s early influences. In his later years Fauré developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the <a href="atonal">atonal</a> music of <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>, and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz. Duchen writes that early works such as the "Cantique de Jean Racine" are in the tradition of French nineteenth-century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.

Influences on Fauré, particularly in his early work, included not only Chopin but Mozart and Schumann. The authors of "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>" (1955), <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West%2C%205th%20Baron%20Sackville">Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Shawe-Taylor%20%28music%20critic%29">Shawe-Taylor</a>, wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, "and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated." His work was based on the strong understanding of harmonic structures that he gained at the <a href="Louis%20Niedermeyer">École Niedermeyer</a> from Niedermeyer's successor <a href="Gustave%20Lef%C3%A8vre">Gustave Lefèvre</a>. Lefèvre wrote the book "Traité d'harmonie" (Paris, 1889), in which he sets out a harmonic theory that differs significantly from the classical theory of <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a>, no longer outlawing certain chords as "<a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a>". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of <a href="Impressionist%20music">Impressionist</a> composers.

In contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Fauré's rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he used discreet syncopations, similar to those found in <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>'s works. Copland referred to him as "the Brahms of France". The music critic Jerry Dubins suggests that Fauré "represents the link between the late German Romanticism of Brahms ... and the French Impressionism of Debussy."

To Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, Fauré's later works do not display the easy charm of his earlier music: "the luscious romantic harmony which had always been firmly supported by a single <a href="tonality">tonality</a>, later gave way to a severely monochrome style, full of <a href="enharmonic">enharmonic</a> shifts, and creating the impression of <a href="polytonality">several tonal centres</a> simultaneously employed."

Fauré is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>". Ravel wrote in 1922 that Fauré had saved French music from the dominance of the German "<a href="Lied">Lied</a>". Two years later the critic <a href="Samuel%20Langford">Samuel Langford</a> wrote of Fauré, "More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought". In a 2011 article the pianist and writer <a href="Roy%20Howat">Roy Howat</a> and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote:
In Copland's view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>, except for isolated songs such as "<a href="Apr%C3%A8s%20un%20r%C3%AAve">Après un rêve</a>" or "Au bord de l'eau", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of "the real Fauré". He instanced "Les berceaux", "Les roses d'Ispahan" and especially "<a href="Clair%20de%20lune%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Clair de lune</a>" as "so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America", and drew attention to less well known mélodies such as "Le secret", "Nocturne", and "Les présents". Fauré also composed a number of <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>s. "<a href="Cinq%20m%C3%A9lodies%20%26quot%3Bde%20Venise%26quot%3B">Cinq mélodies "de Venise"</a>", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Fauré as a novel kind of song <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suite</a>, in its use of <a href="theme%20%28music%29">musical themes</a> recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle "<a href="La%20bonne%20chanson%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">La bonne chanson</a>", Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Fauré. He also wrote that "La bonne chanson" was his most spontaneous composition, with Emma Bardac singing back to him each day's newly written material.
The <a href="Requiem%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a>, Op. 48, was not composed to the memory of a specific person but, in Fauré's words, "for the pleasure of it." It was first performed in 1888. It has been described as "a lullaby of death" because of its predominantly gentle tone. Fauré omitted the <a href="Dies%20irae">Dies irae</a>, though reference to the day of judgment appears in the <a href="Requiem%23Libera%20Me">Libera me</a>, which, like <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>, he added to the normal liturgical text. Fauré revised the Requiem over the years, and a number of different performing versions are now in use, from the earliest, for small forces, to the final revision with full orchestra.

Fauré's operas have not found a place in the regular repertoire. "Prométhée" is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>" (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, "distinctly non-theatrical." The work uses <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Fauré's late style, "tonality is stretched hard, without breaking." On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, <a href="Peter%20Heyworth">Peter Heyworth</a> wrote, "A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre. ... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective." However, after a 2006 production at the <a href="Wexford%20Festival">Wexford Festival</a>, Ian Fox wrote, "Fauré's "Pénélope" is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was."

Fauré's major sets of piano works are thirteen <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a>s, thirteen <a href="barcarolle">barcarolle</a>s, six <a href="impromptu">impromptu</a>s, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across the decades of his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are "Romances sans paroles", <a href="Ballade%20%28classical%20music%29">Ballade</a> in F major, <a href="Mazurka">Mazurka</a> in B major, "Thème et variations" in C major, and "Huit pièces brèves". For <a href="piano%20four%20hands">piano duet</a>, Fauré composed the "<a href="Dolly%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Dolly Suite</a>" and, together with his friend and former pupil <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>, an exuberant parody of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> in the short suite "Souvenirs de Bayreuth".

The piano works often use <a href="Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> figures, with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists. Even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play. The early piano works are clearly influenced by Chopin. An even greater influence was <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other. In Copland's view, it was with the sixth Nocturne that Fauré fully emerged from any predecessor's shadow. The pianist <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a> said, "There are few pages in all music comparable to these." The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the charming earlier piano works, such as the Impromptu No. 2, rather than the later piano works, which express "such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation" that listeners are left uneasy. In his piano music, as in most of his works, Fauré shunned virtuosity in favour of the classical lucidity often associated with the French. He was unimpressed by purely virtuoso pianists, saying, "the greater they are, the worse they play me."

Fauré was not greatly interested in orchestration, and on occasion asked his former students such as <a href="Jean%20Roger-Ducasse">Jean Roger-Ducasse</a> and <a href="Charles%20Koechlin">Charles Koechlin</a> to orchestrate his concert and theatre works. In Nectoux's words, Fauré's generally sober orchestral style reflects "a definite aesthetic attitude ... The idea of timbre was not a determining one in Fauré's musical thinking". He was not attracted by flamboyant combinations of tone-colours, which he thought either self-indulgent or a disguise for lack of real musical invention. He told his students that it should be possible to produce an orchestration without resorting to <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a>s, <a href="celesta">celesta</a>s, <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a>s, bells or electrical instruments. Debussy admired the spareness of Fauré's orchestration, finding in it the transparency he strove for in his own 1913 ballet "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>"; <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Poulenc</a>, by contrast, described Fauré's orchestration as "a leaden overcoat ... instrumental mud". Fauré's best-known orchestral works are the suites "<a href="Masques%20et%20bergamasques%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Masques et bergamasques</a>" (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or "divertissement comique"), which he orchestrated himself, "<a href="Dolly%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Dolly</a>", orchestrated by <a href="Henri%20Rabaud">Henri Rabaud</a>, and "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" which draws on incidental music for <a href="Maurice%20Maeterlinck">Maeterlinck</a>'s play; the stage version was orchestrated by Koechlin, but Fauré himself reworked the orchestration for the published suite.

In the <a href="chamber%20music">chamber</a> repertoire, his two piano quartets, in <a href="Piano%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">C minor</a> and <a href="Piano%20Quartet%20No.%202%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">G minor</a>, particularly the former, are among Fauré's better-known works. His other chamber music includes two <a href="piano%20quintet">piano quintet</a>s, two <a href="cello%20sonata">cello sonata</a>s, two <a href="violin%20sonata">violin sonata</a>s, a <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a> and a <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">string quartet</a>. Copland (writing in 1924 before the string quartet was finished) held the second quintet to be Fauré's masterpiece: "... a pure well of spirituality ... extremely classic, as far removed as possible from the romantic temperament." Other critics have taken a less favourable view: "The Record Guide" commented, "The ceaseless flow and restricted colour scheme of Fauré's last manner, as exemplified in this Quintet, need very careful management, if they are not to become tedious." Fauré's last work, the <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">String Quartet</a>, has been described by critics in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" magazine as an intimate meditation on the last things, and "an extraordinary work by any standards, ethereal and other-worldly with themes that seem constantly to be drawn skywards."

Fauré made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. Well over a hundred recordings of Fauré's music were made between 1898 and 1905, mostly of songs, with a few short chamber works, by performers including the singers <a href="Jean%20Not%C3%A9">Jean Noté</a> and <a href="Pol%20Plan%C3%A7on">Pol Plançon</a> and players such as <a href="Jacques%20Thibaud">Jacques Thibaud</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a>. By the 1920s a range of Fauré's more popular songs were on record, including "Après un rêve" sung by Olga Haley, and "Automne" and "Clair de lune" sung by <a href="Ninon%20Vallin">Ninon Vallin</a>. In the 1930s better-known performers recorded Fauré pieces, including <a href="Georges%20Thill">Georges Thill</a> ("En prière"), and <a href="Jacques%20Thibaud">Jacques Thibaud</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a> (Violin Sonata No. 1 and Berceuse). The Sicilienne from "Pelléas et Mélisande" was recorded in 1938.

By the 1940s there were a few more Fauré works in the catalogues. A survey by <a href="John%20Culshaw">John Culshaw</a> in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by <a href="Kathleen%20Long">Kathleen Long</a> (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Thème et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by <a href="Boyd%20Neel">Boyd Neel</a>), the Requiem conducted by <a href="Ernest%20Bourmauck">Ernest Bourmauck</a>, and seven songs sung by <a href="Maggie%20Teyte">Maggie Teyte</a>. Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s. "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>", 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles "La bonne chanson" and "La chanson d'Ève".

In the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies have built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré's music, performed by French and non-French musicians. Several modern recordings of Fauré's music have come to public notice as prize-winners in annual awards organised by "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" and the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. Sets of his major orchestral works have been recorded under conductors including <a href="Michel%20Plasson">Michel Plasson</a> (1981) and <a href="Yan%20Pascal%20Tortelier">Yan Pascal Tortelier</a> (1996). Fauré's main chamber works have all been recorded, with players including the <a href="Ysa%C3%BFe%20Quartet%20%281984%29">Ysaÿe Quartet</a>, <a href="Domus">Domus</a>, <a href="Paul%20Tortelier">Paul Tortelier</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Grumiaux">Arthur Grumiaux</a>, and <a href="Joshua%20Bell">Joshua Bell</a>. The complete piano works have been recorded by <a href="Kathryn%20Stott">Kathryn Stott</a> (1995), and <a href="Paul%20Crossley%20%28musician%29">Paul Crossley</a> (1984–85), with substantial sets of the major piano works from <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Collard">Jean-Philippe Collard</a> (1982–84), <a href="Pascal%20Rog%C3%A9">Pascal Rogé</a> (1990), and <a href="Kun-Woo%20Paik">Kun-Woo Paik</a> (2002). Fauré's songs have all been recorded for CD, including a complete set (2005), anchored by the accompanist <a href="Graham%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Graham Johnson</a>, with soloists <a href="Jean-Paul%20Fouch%C3%A9court">Jean-Paul Fouchécourt</a>, <a href="Felicity%20Lott">Felicity Lott</a>, <a href="John%20Mark%20Ainsley">John Mark Ainsley</a> and <a href="Jennifer%20Smith%20%28soprano%29">Jennifer Smith</a>, among others. The Requiem and the shorter choral works are also well represented on disc. "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>" has been recorded twice, with casts headed by <a href="R%C3%A9gine%20Crespin">Régine Crespin</a> in 1956, and <a href="Jessye%20Norman">Jessye Norman</a> in 1981, conducted respectively by <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9-%C3%89mile%20Inghelbrecht">Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dutoit">Charles Dutoit</a>. "Prométhée" has not been recorded in full, but extensive excerpts were recorded under <a href="Roger%20Norrington">Roger Norrington</a> (1980).

A 2001 article on Fauré in "<a href="Baker%27s%20Biographical%20Dictionary%20of%20Musicians">Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</a>" concludes thus:
Fauré's biographer Nectoux writes in the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>" that Fauré is widely regarded as the greatest master of French song, and that alongside the "mélodies," the chamber works rank as "Fauré's most important contribution to music". The critic <a href="Robert%20Orledge">Robert Orledge</a> writes, "His genius was one of synthesis: he reconciled such opposing elements as <a href="mode%20%28music%29">modality</a> and tonality, anguish and serenity, seduction and force within a single non-eclectic style, as in the "Pelléas et Mélisande" suite, his symphonic masterpiece. The quality of constant renewal within an apparently limited range ... is a remarkable facet of his genius, and the spare, elliptical style of his single String Quartet suggests that his intensely self-disciplined style was still developing at the time of his death".

Surface weather analysis

Surface weather analysis is a special type of <a href="weather%20map">weather map</a> that provides a view of <a href="weather">weather</a> elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.

Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as <a href="sea%20level%20pressure">sea level pressure</a>, <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, and <a href="cloud%20cover">cloud cover</a> onto a <a href="geographical%20map">geographical map</a> to help find <a href="synoptic%20scale">synoptic scale</a> features such as <a href="weather%20fronts">weather fronts</a>.

The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After the advent of the <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>, simultaneous <a href="surface%20weather%20observation">surface weather observation</a>s became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the <a href="Norwegian%20cyclone%20model">Norwegian cyclone model</a> for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Surface weather analyses have special symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a>, or other important information. For example, an "H" may represent <a href="high-pressure%20area">high pressure</a>, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An "L", on the other hand, may represent <a href="low%20pressure">low pressure</a>, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.

The use of weather charts in a modern sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. The development of a <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> network by 1845 made it possible to gather weather information from multiple distant locations quickly enough to preserve its value for real-time applications. The Smithsonian Institution developed its network of observers over much of the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s. The <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Signal%20Corps">U.S. Army Signal Corps</a> inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards.

The weather data was at first less useful as a result of the different times at which weather observations were made. The first attempts at time standardization took hold in Great Britain by 1855. The entire United States did not finally come under the influence of time zones until 1905, when <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> finally established standard time. Other countries followed the lead of the United States in taking simultaneous weather observations, starting in 1873. Other countries then began preparing surface analyses. The use of frontal zones on weather maps did not appear until the introduction of the <a href="Norwegian%20cyclone%20model">Norwegian cyclone model</a> in the late 1910s, despite Loomis' earlier attempt at a similar notion in 1841. Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the <a href="military%20front">military front</a>s of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the term "front" came into use to represent these lines.

Despite the introduction of the Norwegian <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a> model just after World War I, the United States did not formally analyze fronts on surface analyses until late 1942, when the WBAN Analysis Center opened in downtown <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969, with the process complete in the 1970s. <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987. By 1999, computer systems and software had finally become sophisticated enough to allow for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and <a href="frontogenesis">frontogenesis</a> in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-<a href="Advanced%20Weather%20Interactive%20Processing%20System">AWIPS</a> workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a> and <a href="geographic%20information%20system">geographic information system</a>s have made it possible to devise finely tailored weather maps. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years. The <a href="pressureNET">pressureNET</a> project is an ongoing attempt to gather surface pressure data using smartphones.

When analyzing a weather map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, dewpoint, <a href="wind">wind</a> <a href="Wind%20speed">speed</a> and <a href="Wind%20direction">direction</a>, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The circle in the middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of <a href="overcast">overcast</a>. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a>. The <a href="wind%20barb">wind barb</a> points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents of wind, each half flag represents . When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted in the corner of the station model are in <a href="inch">inch</a>es. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the <a href="millimeter">millimeter</a>. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing <a href="isobar%20%28meteorology%29">isobars</a> (lines of equal pressure), isallobars (lines of equal pressure change), isotherms (lines of equal temperature), and <a href="isotach">isotach</a>s (lines of equal wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.

A synoptic scale feature is one whose dimensions are large in scale, more than several hundred kilometers in length. Migratory pressure systems and frontal zones exist on this scale.

Centers of surface high- and low-pressure areas that are found within closed isobars on a surface weather analysis are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general weather is in their vicinity. Weather maps in English-speaking countries will depict their highs as Hs and lows as Ls, while Spanish-speaking countries will depict their highs as As and lows as Bs.

Low-pressure systems, also known as <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s, are located in minima in the pressure field. Rotation is inward at the surface and counterclockwise in the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> as opposed to inward and clockwise in the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> due to the <a href="Coriolis%20force">Coriolis force</a>. Weather is normally unsettled in the vicinity of a cyclone, with increased cloudiness, increased winds, increased temperatures, and upward motion in the atmosphere, which leads to an increased chance of precipitation. <a href="Polar%20low">Polar low</a>s can form over relatively mild ocean waters when cold air sweeps in from the ice cap. The relatively warmer water leads to upward convection, causing a low to form, and precipitation usually in the form of snow. Tropical cyclones and winter storms are intense varieties of low pressure. Over land, <a href="thermal%20low">thermal low</a>s are indicative of hot weather during the summer.

High-pressure systems, also known as <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a>s, rotate outward at the surface and clockwise in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.

Fronts in meteorology are the leading edges of <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a>es that have a density, air temperature, and <a href="humidity">humidity</a> different from the air mass it is invading. When an air mass passes over an area, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and often a change in the precipitation pattern. The change is called a front, whether it be warm or cold. <a href="Cold%20front">Cold front</a>s develop when cold air masses, usually moving equatorward from the polar region high pressure zones, interact with warm moist air of low pressure systems. The fronts develop at the leading edge of that cold air mass and wrap around (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere) about the low pressure zone. A polar front may form approximately along the equatorward edge of the high-level polar jet. Fronts are guided by winds aloft, but they normally move at lesser speeds than those winds. In the northern hemisphere, they usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction as well as they may wrap around an associated low pressure zone. Movement is driven by the <a href="pressure%20gradient%20force">pressure gradient force</a> (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the <a href="Coriolis%20effect">Coriolis force</a> (caused by the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s rotation on its axis). Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.

A cold front's location is at the leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an <a href="isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherm</a> analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in <a href="weather">weather</a>, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading edge of the cooler air mass.

<a href="Warm%20front">Warm front</a>s mark the position on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air. The temperature increase is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts. Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly <a href="Stratus%20cloud">stratiform</a> and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. <a href="Fog">Fog</a> can also occur preceding a warm front passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front. If the warm air mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.

An <a href="occluded%20front">occluded front</a> is formed during the process of <a href="cyclogenesis">cyclogenesis</a> when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with <a href="thunderstorms">thunderstorms</a> possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.

The trowal is the projection on the Earth's surface of a tongue of warm air aloft, such as may be formed during the occlusion process of a depression.

A stationary front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, neither of which is strong enough to replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a stationary front, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.

When stationary fronts become smaller in scale, degenerating to a narrow zone where wind direction changes over a short distance, they become known as shear lines. If the shear line becomes active with thunderstorms, it may support formation of a <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> or a regeneration of the feature back into a stationary front. A shear line is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes.

<a href="Mesoscale%20meteorology">Mesoscale</a> features are smaller than <a href="synoptic%20scale">synoptic scale</a> systems like fronts, but larger than <a href="storm-scale">storm-scale</a> systems like thunderstorms. Horizontal dimensions generally range from over ten kilometres to several hundred kilometres.

The <a href="dry%20line">dry line</a> is the boundary between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a>, depicted at the leading edge of the <a href="dew%20point">dew point</a>, or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, warm moist air that is denser than warmer, dryer air wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front wedging under warmer air. When the warm moist air wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.

During daylight hours, drier air from aloft drifts down to the surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward. At night, the boundary reverts to the west as there is no longer any solar heating to help mix the lower atmosphere. If enough moisture converges upon the dryline, it can be the focus of afternoon and evening thunderstorms. A dry line is depicted on United States surface analyses as a brown line with scallops, or bumps, facing into the moist sector. Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the special shapes along the drawn boundary do not necessarily reflect the boundary's direction of motion.

Organized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but they can outrun cold fronts. This outrunning occurs in a pattern where the upper level jet splits into two streams. The resultant <a href="mesoscale%20convective%20system">mesoscale convective system</a> (MCS) forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern at the area of the best low-level <a href="Inflow%20%28meteorology%29">inflow</a>. The convection then moves east and equatorward into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge where the significant wind shifts and pressure rises. Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms will lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and <a href="Outflow%20boundary">outflow boundaries</a> exist ahead of this type of activity, "SQLN" or "SQUALL LINE", while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of "OUTFLOW BOUNDARY" or "OUTFLOW BNDRY".

<a href="Sea%20breeze">Sea breeze</a> fronts occur on sunny days when the landmass warms the air above it to a temperature above the water temperature. Similar boundaries from downwind on lakes and rivers during the day, as well as offshore landmasses at night. Since the <a href="specific%20heat">specific heat</a> of water is so high, there is little diurnal temperature change in bodies of water, even on the sunniest days. The water temperature varies less than . By contrast, the land, with a lower specific heat, can vary several degrees in a matter of hours.

During the afternoon, air pressure decreases over the land as the warmer air rises. The relatively cooler air over the sea rushes in to replace it. The result is a relatively cool onshore wind. This process usually reverses at night where the water temperature is higher relative to the landmass, leading to an offshore land breeze. However, if water temperatures are colder than the land at night, the sea breeze may continue, only somewhat abated. This is typically the case along the <a href="California">California</a> coast, for example.

If enough moisture exists, thunderstorms can form along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.

Abu Nidal

Sabri Khalil al-Banna (May 1937 – 16 August 2002), known as Abu Nidal, was the founder of Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, a militant <a href="Palestinians">Palestinian</a> splinter group more commonly known as the <a href="Abu%20Nidal%20Organization">Abu Nidal Organization</a> (ANO). At the height of its power in the 1970s and 1980s, the ANO was widely regarded as the most ruthless of the Palestinian groups.

Abu Nidal ("father of struggle") formed the ANO in October 1974 after a split from <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>'s <a href="Fatah">Fatah</a> faction within the <a href="Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO). Acting as a freelance contractor, Abu Nidal is believed to have ordered attacks in 20 countries, killing over 300 and injuring over 650. The group's operations included the <a href="Rome%20and%20Vienna%20airport%20attacks">Rome and Vienna airport attacks</a> on 27 December 1985, when gunmen opened fire on passengers in simultaneous shootings at <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> ticket counters, killing 20. <a href="Patrick%20Seale">Patrick Seale</a>, Abu Nidal's biographer, wrote of the shootings that their "random cruelty marked them as typical Abu Nidal operations".

Abu Nidal died after a shooting in his Baghdad apartment in August 2002. Palestinian sources believed he was killed on the orders of <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, while Iraqi officials insisted he had committed suicide during an interrogation. "He was the patriot turned psychopath", <a href="David%20Hirst%20%28journalist%29">David Hirst</a> wrote in the "Guardian" on the news of his death. "He served only himself, only the warped personal drives that pushed him into hideous crime. He was the ultimate mercenary."

Abu Nidal was born in <a href="Jaffa%2C%20Israel">Jaffa</a>, on the Mediterranean coast of what was then the <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a>. His father, Hajj Khalil al-Banna, owned 6,000 acres (24 km) of orange groves situated between Jaffa and Majdal, today <a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a> in Israel. The family lived in luxury in a three-storey stone house near the beach, later used as an Israeli military court. Muhammad Khalil al-Banna, Abu Nidal's brother, told <a href="Yossi%20Melman">Yossi Melman</a>:

Khalil al-Banna's wealth allowed him to take several wives. According to Abu Nidal in an interview with "Der Spiegel", his father had 13 wives, 17 sons and eight daughters. Melman writes that Abu Nidal's mother was the eighth wife. She had been one of the family's maids, a 16-year-old <a href="Alawite">Alawite</a> girl. The family disapproved of the marriage, according to <a href="Patrick%20Seale">Patrick Seale</a>, and as a result Abu Nidal, Khalil's 12th child, was apparently looked down on by his older siblings, although in later life the relationships were repaired.

In 1944 or 1945, his father sent him to <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20des%20Fr%C3%A8res%20de%20Jaffa">Collège des Frères de Jaffa</a>, a French mission school, which he attended for one year. When his father died in 1945, when Abu Nidal was seven years old, the family turned his mother out of the house. His brothers took him out of the mission school and enrolled him instead in a prestigious, private Muslim school in Jerusalem, now known as <a href="Umariya%20Elementary%20School">Umariya Elementary School</a>, which he attended for about two years.

On 29 November 1947, the United Nations resolved to <a href="United%20Nations%20Partition%20Plan%20for%20Palestine">partition Palestine</a> into an Arab and Jewish state. Fighting broke out immediately, and the disruption of the citrus-fruit business hit the family's income. In Jaffa there were food shortages, truck bombs and an <a href="Irgun">Irgun</a> mortar bombardment. Melman writes that the al-Banna family had had good relations with the Jewish community. Abu Nidal's brother told Melman that their father had been a friend of Avraham Shapira, a founder of the Jewish defense organization, <a href="Hashomer">Hashomer</a>: "He would visit [Shapira] in his home in Petah Tikva, or Shapira riding his horse would visit our home in Jaffa. I also remember how we visited Dr. Weizmann [later first president of Israel] in his home in Rehovot." But it was war, and the relationships did not help them.

Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli troops in April 1948, the family fled to their house near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, and they had to flee again. This time they went to the <a href="Bureij">Bureij</a> refugee camp in the <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a>, then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, dependent on <a href="UNRWA">UNRWA</a> for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.

The al-Banna family's commercial experience, and the money they had managed to take with them, meant they could set themselves up in business again, Melman writes. Their orange groves had gone, now part of the new state of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948. The family moved to <a href="Nablus">Nablus</a> in the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>, then under Jordanian control. In 1955, Abu Nidal graduated from high school, joined the Arab nationalist <a href="Ba%27ath%20party">Ba'ath party</a>, and began a degree course in engineering at <a href="Cairo%20University">Cairo University</a>, but he left after two years without a degree. In 1960, he made his way to Saudi Arabia, where he set himself up as a painter and electrician, and worked as a casual laborer for <a href="Saudi%20Aramco">Aramco</a>. His brother told Melman that Abu Nidal would return to Nablus from Saudi Arabia every year to visit his mother. It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. The marriage produced a son and two daughters.

Abu Nidal was often in poor health, according to Seale, and tended to dress in zip-up jackets and old trousers, drinking whisky every night in his later years. He became, writes Seale, a "master of disguises and subterfuge, trusting no one, lonely and self-protective, [living] like a mole, hidden away from public view". Acquaintances said that he was capable of hard work and had a good financial brain. <a href="Salah%20Khalaf">Salah Khalaf</a> (Abu Iyad), the deputy chief of Fatah who was assassinated by the ANO in 1991, knew him well in the late 1960s when he took Abu Nidal under his wing. He told Seale:

He had been recommended to me as a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.

Seale suggests that Abu Nidal's childhood explained his personality, described as chaotic by Abu Iyad and as psychopathic by <a href="Issam%20Sartawi">Issam Sartawi</a>, the late Palestinian heart surgeon. His siblings' scorn, the loss of his father, and his mother's removal from the family home when he was seven, then the loss of his home and status in the conflict with Israel, created a mental world of plots and counterplots, reflected in his tyrannical leadership of the ANO. Members' wives (it was an all-male group) were not allowed to befriend each another, and Abu Nidal's wife was expected to live in isolation without friends.

In Saudi Arabia Abu Nidal helped found a small group of young Palestinians who called themselves the Palestine Secret Organization. The activism cost him his job and home: Aramco fired him, and the Saudi government imprisoned then expelled him. He returned to Nablus with his wife and family, and joined Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO. Working as an odd-job man, he was committed to Palestinian politics but was not particularly active, until Israel won the 1967 <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>, capturing the <a href="Golan%20Heights">Golan Heights</a>, the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> and the <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. Melman writes that "the entrance of the Israel Defense Forces tanks into Nablus was a traumatic experience for him. The conquest aroused him to action."

After moving to <a href="Amman">Amman</a>, Jordan, he set up a trading company called Impex, which acted as a front for Fatah, serving as a meeting place and conduit for funds. This became a hallmark of Abu Nidal's career. Companies controlled by the ANO made him a rich man by engaging in legitimate business deals, while acting as cover for arms deals and mercenary activities> 
When Fatah asked him to choose a "<a href="nom%20de%20guerre">nom de guerre</a>", he chose Abu Nidal ("father of struggle") after his son, Nidal. Those who knew him at the time said he was a well-organized leader, not a guerrilla; during fighting between the <a href="Palestinian%20fedayeen">Palestinian "fedayeen"</a> and King Hussein's troops, he stayed in his office. In 1968 Abu Iyad appointed him as the Fatah representative in <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) to the same position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before <a href="Black%20September%20in%20Jordan">Black September</a>, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian "fedayeen" out of Jordan, with the loss of thousands of lives. Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, Seale writes, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that he was interested only in saving himself.

Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began accusing the PLO, over his Voice of Palestine radio station in Iraq, of cowardice for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, he joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and <a href="Abu%20Daoud">Abu Daoud</a> (leader of the <a href="Black%20September%20Organization">Black September Organization</a> responsible for the 1972 <a href="Munich%20Massacre">Munich Massacre</a>) in calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.
In February 1973, Abu Daoud was arrested in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name "Al-Iqab" ("the Punishment"). On 5 September 1973, five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and threatened to blow up the building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.

On the day of the attack, 56 heads of state were meeting in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> for the 4th conference of the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>. According to Seale, the Saudi Embassy operation had been commissioned by Iraq's president, <a href="Ahmed%20Hasan%20al-Bakr">Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr</a>, as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference. Seale writes one of the hostage-takers admitted that he had been told to fly the hostages around until the conference was over.

Abu Nidal had carried out the operation without the permission of Fatah. <a href="Abu%20Iyad">Abu Iyad</a> (Arafat's deputy) and <a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a> (later <a href="President%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20Authority">President of the Palestinian Authority</a>), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! We asked him to mount it for us." Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as under the control of the Iraqi government.

Two months later, in November 1973 (just after the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> in October), the ANO hijacked <a href="KLM%20Flight%20861">KLM Flight 861</a>, this time using the name Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. Fatah had been discussing convening a peace conference in Geneva; the hijacking was intended to warn them not to go ahead with it. In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.

In October 1974 Abu Nidal formed the ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court sentenced him to death "in absentia" for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that it is unlikely that Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but it was clear that he had become "persona non grata". As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.

In addition to Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, the ANO called itself the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Black June (for actions against Syria), Black September (for actions against Jordan), the Revolutionary Arab Brigades, the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims, the Egyptian Revolution, Revolutionary Egypt, "Al-Asifa" ("the Storm," a name also used by Fatah), "Al-Iqab" ("the Punishment"), and the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.

The group had up to 500 members, chosen from young men in the <a href="Palestinian%20refugee%20camp">Palestinian refugee camp</a>s and in Lebanon, who were promised good pay and help looking after their families. They would be sent to training camps in whichever country was hosting the ANO at the time (Syria, Iraq or Libya), then organized into small cells. Once in, <a href="As%60ad%20AbuKhalil">As`ad AbuKhalil</a> and Michael Fischbach write, they were not allowed to leave again. The group assumed complete control over the membership. One member who spoke to Patrick Seale was told before being sent overseas: "If we say, 'Drink alcohol'", do so. If we say, 'Get married,' find a woman and marry her. If we say, 'Don't have children,' you must obey. If we say, 'Go and kill King Hussein,' you must be ready to sacrifice yourself!"

Seale writes that recruits were asked to write out their life stories, including names and addresses of family and friends, then sign a paper saying they agreed to execution if discovered to have intelligence connections. If suspected, they would be asked to rewrite the whole story, without discrepancies. The ANO's newspaper "Filastin al-Thawra" regularly announced the execution of traitors. Abu Nidal believed that the group had been penetrated by Israeli agents, and there was a sense that Israel may have used the ANO to undermine more moderate Palestinian groups. Terrorism experts regard the view that Abu Nidal himself was such agent as "far-fetched".

There were reports of purges throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Around 600 ANO members were killed in Lebanon and Libya, including 171 in one night in November 1987, when they were lined up, shot and thrown into a mass grave. Dozens were kidnapped in Syria and killed in the Badawi refugee camp. Most of the decisions to kill, Abu Daoud told Seale, were taken by Abu Nidal "in the middle of the night, after he [had] knocked back a whole bottle of whiskey." The purges led to the defection from the ANO in 1989 of Atif Abu Bakr, head of the ANO's political directorate, who returned to Fatah.

Members were routinely tortured by the "Committee for Revolutionary Justice" until they confessed to disloyalty. Seale writes that reports of torture included hanging a man naked, whipping him until he was unconscious, reviving him with cold water, then rubbing salt or chili powder into his wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tyre with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, salted and revived with cold water. A member's testicles might be fried in oil, or melted plastic dripped onto his skin. Between interrogations, prisoners would be tied up in tiny cells. If the cells were full, Seale writes, they might be buried with a pipe in their mouths for air and water; if Abu Nidal wanted them dead, a bullet would be fired down the pipe instead.

The Intelligence Directorate was formed in 1985 to oversee special operations. It had four subcommittees: the Committee for Special Missions, the Foreign Intelligence Committee, the Counterespionage Committee and the Lebanon Committee. Led by Abd al-Rahman Isa, the longest-serving member of the ANO—Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and shabby, but charming and persuasive—the directorate maintained 30–40 people overseas who looked after the ANO's arms caches in various countries. It trained staff, arranged passports and visas, and reviewed security at airports and seaports. Members were not allowed to visit each other at home, and no one outside the directorate was supposed to know who was a member. Abu Nidal demoted Isa in 1987, believing he had become too close to other figures within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, he insisted that Isa remain in the Intelligence Directorate, where he had to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told to treat him with contempt.

The job of the Committee for Special Missions was to choose targets. It had started life as the Military Committee, headed by Naji Abu al-Fawaris, who had led the attack on <a href="Heinz%20Nittel">Heinz Nittel</a>, head of the Israel-Austria Friendship League, who was shot and killed in 1981. In 1982 the committee changed its name to the Committee for Special Missions, headed by Dr. Ghassan al-Ali, who had been born in the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> and educated in England, where he obtained a BA and MA in chemistry and married a British woman (later divorced). A former ANO member told Seale that Ali favoured "the most extreme and reckless operations."

On 3 June 1982, ANO operative Hussein Ghassan Said shot <a href="Shlomo%20Argov">Shlomo Argov</a>, the Israeli ambassador to Britain, once in the head as he left the <a href="Dorchester%20Hotel">Dorchester Hotel</a> in London. Said was accompanied by Nawaf al-Rosan, an Iraqi intelligence officer, and Marwan al-Banna, Abu Nidal's cousin. Argov survived, but spent three months in a coma and the rest of his life disabled, until his death in February 2003. The PLO quickly denied responsibility for the attack.

<a href="Ariel%20Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>, then Israel's defence minister, responded three days later by <a href="1982%20Lebanon%20War">invading Lebanon</a>, where the PLO was based, a reaction that Seale argues Abu Nidal had intended. The Israeli government had been preparing to invade and Abu Nidal provided a pretext. "Der Spiegel" put it to him in October 1985 that the assassination of Argov, when he knew Israel wanted to attack the PLO in Lebanon, made him appear to be working for the Israelis, in the view of Yasser Arafat. He replied:

What Arafat says about me doesn't bother me. Not only he, but also a whole list of Arab and world politicians claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents. ... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.

Abu Nidal's most infamous operation was the 1985 attack on the Rome and Vienna airports. On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> ticket counter at the <a href="Leonardo%20Da%20Vinci%20International%20Airport">Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport</a> in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In <a href="Vienna%20International%20Airport">Vienna International Airport</a> a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.

Austria and Italy had both been involved in trying to arrange peace talks. Sources close to Abu Nidal told Seale that Libyan intelligence had supplied the weapons. The damage to the PLO was enormous, according to <a href="Abu%20Iyad">Abu Iyad</a>, Arafat's deputy. Most people in the West and even many Arabs could not distinguish between the ANO and Fatah, he said. "When such horrible things take place, ordinary people are left thinking that all Palestinians are criminals."

On 15 April 1986, the US launched bombing raids from British bases against <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, killing around 100, in retaliation for the bombing of a <a href="1986%20Berlin%20discotheque%20bombing">Berlin nightclub</a> used by US service personnel. The dead were reported to include Hanna Gaddafi, the adoptive daughter of Libyan leader <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>; two of his other children were injured. British journalist Alec Collett, who had been kidnapped in Beirut in March, was hanged after the airstrikes, reportedly by ANO operatives; his remains were found in the <a href="Beqaa%20Valley">Beqaa Valley</a> in November 2009. The bodies of two British teachers, Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield, and an American, Peter Kilburn, were found in a village near Beirut on 17 April 1986; the Arab Fedayeen Cells, a name linked to Abu Nidal, claimed responsibility. British journalist <a href="John%20McCarthy%20%28journalist%29">John McCarthy</a> was kidnapped the same day.

On 17 April 1986—the day the bodies of the teachers were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in <a href="Heathrow%20airport">Heathrow airport</a> with a <a href="Semtex">Semtex</a> bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé <a href="Nizar%20Hindawi">Nizar Hindawi</a>, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married. According to Melman, Abu Nidal had recommended Hindawi to Syrian intelligence. Seale writes that the bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack was in response to Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.

On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at <a href="Karachi%20Airport">Karachi Airport</a> on its way from Mumbai to New York, holding 389 passengers and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the tarmac before detonating grenades inside the cabin. <a href="Neerja%20Bhanot">Neerja Bhanot</a>, the flight's senior purser, was able to open an emergency door, and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded. The London "Times" reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking.

Abu Nidal began to move his organization out of Syria to Libya in the summer of 1986, arriving there in March 1987. In June that year the Syrian government expelled him, in part because of the Hindawi affair and Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking. He repeatedly took credit during this period for operations in which he had no involvement, including the 1984 <a href="Brighton%20hotel%20bombing">Brighton hotel bombing</a>, 1985 <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">Bradford City stadium fire</a>, and 1986 assassination of <a href="Zafer%20al-Masri">Zafer al-Masri</a>, the mayor of Nablus (killed by the <a href="Popular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine">PFLP</a>, according to Seale). By publishing a congratulatory note in the ANO's magazine, he also implied that he had been behind the 1986 <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">Space Shuttle Challenger disaster</a>, writes Seale.

Abu Nidal and Libya's leader, <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, allegedly became great friends, each holding what <a href="Marie%20Colvin">Marie Colvin</a> and Sonya Murad called a "dangerous combination of an inferiority complex mixed with the belief that he was a man of great destiny". The relationship gave Abu Nidal a sponsor and Gaddafi a mercenary. Seale reports that Libya brought out the worst in Abu Nidal. He would not allow even the most senior ANO members to socialize with each other; all meetings had to be reported to him. All passports had to be handed over. No one was allowed to travel without his permission. Ordinary members were not allowed to have telephones; senior members were allowed to make local calls only. His members knew nothing about his daily life, including where he lived. If he wanted to entertain, Seale writes, he would take over the home of another member.

According to Abu Bakr, speaking to "Al Hayatt" in 2002, Abu Nidal said he was behind the bombing of <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%20103">Pan Am Flight 103</a>, which exploded over <a href="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a>, Scotland, on 21 December 1988; a former head of security for <a href="Libyan%20Arab%20Airlines">Libyan Arab Airlines</a> was later convicted. Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: "We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill him with my own hands!" Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it; one of Abu Nidal's associates told him, "If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe, Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work."

In the late 1980s British intelligence learned that the ANO held accounts with the <a href="Bank%20of%20Credit%20and%20Commerce%20International">Bank of Credit and Commerce International</a> (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself was said to have visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was. Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact, half the shipment went to the police in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> and half to Abu Nidal.

On 14 January 1991 in Tunis, the night before US forces moved into Kuwait, the ANO assassinated <a href="Abu%20Iyad">Abu Iyad</a>, head of PLO intelligence, along with Abu al-Hol, Fatah's chief of security, and Fakhri al-Umari, another Fatah aide; all three men were shot in Abu Iyad's home. The killer, Hamza Abu Zaid, confessed that an ANO operative had hired him. When he shot Abu Iyad, he reportedly shouted, "Let Atif Abu Bakr help you now!", a reference to the senior ANO member who had left the group in 1989, and whom Abu Nidal believed had been planted within the ANO by Abu Iyad as a spy. Abu Iyad had known that Abu Nidal nursed a hatred of him, in part because he had kept Abu Nidal out of the PLO. But the real reason for the hatred, Abu Iyad told Seale, was that he had protected Abu Nidal in his early years within the movement. Given his personality, Abu Nidal could not acknowledge that debt. Seale writes that the murder "must therefore be seen as a final settlement of old scores".

After Libyan intelligence operatives were charged with the Lockerbie bombing, Gaddafi tried to distance himself from terrorism. Abu Nidal was expelled from Libya in 1999, and in 2002 he returned to Iraq. The Iraqi government later said he had entered the country using a fake Yemeni passport and false name.

On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian newspaper <a href="Al-Ayyam%20%28Ramallah%29">"al-Ayyam"</a> reported that Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds at his home in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the "<a href="Iraqi%20Intelligence%20Service">Mukhabarat</a>", the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, <a href="Tahir%20Jalil%20Habbush%20al-Tikriti">Taher Jalil Habbush</a>, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.

"<a href="Jane%27s%20Information%20Group">Jane's</a>" reported in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents in his home about a US attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told "Jane's" that he had been shot several times. "Jane's" suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him in the event of an American invasion.

In 2008 <a href="Robert%20Fisk">Robert Fisk</a> obtained a report written in September 2002, for Saddam Hussein's "presidency intelligence office," by Iraq's "Special Intelligence Unit M4." The report said that the Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States, and that he had been asked by the Kuwaitis to find links between Iraq and <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went into his bedroom and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.

Bride of Frankenstein

The Bride of Frankenstein is a 1935 American <a href="Science%20fiction%20film">science-fiction</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, the first <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a>' 1931 hit "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281931%20film%29">Frankenstein</a>". It is considered one of the few sequels to a great film that is even better than the original film on which it is based. As with the first film, "Bride of Frankenstein" was directed by <a href="James%20Whale">James Whale</a> and stars <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a> as <a href="Frankenstein%27s%20monster">the Monster</a>. The sequel features <a href="Elsa%20Lanchester">Elsa Lanchester</a> in the dual role of <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> and the Monster's mate at the end of the film. <a href="Colin%20Clive">Colin Clive</a> reprises his role as <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Henry Frankenstein</a>, and <a href="Ernest%20Thesiger">Ernest Thesiger</a> plays the role of <a href="Doctor%20Septimus%20Pretorius">Doctor Septimus Pretorius</a>.

The movie starts as an immediate sequel to the events that concluded the earlier film, and is rooted in a subplot of the original <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> novel, "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" (1818). In the film, a chastened Henry Frankenstein abandons his plans to create life, only to be tempted and finally coerced by his old mentor Dr. Pretorius, along with threats from the Monster, into constructing a <a href="Bride%20of%20Frankenstein%20%28character%29">mate</a> for the Monster.

The preparation to film the sequel began shortly after the premiere of the first film, but script problems delayed the project. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began in January 1935, with creative personnel from the original returning in front of and behind the camera. "Bride of Frankenstein" was released to critical and popular acclaim, although it encountered difficulties with some state and national censorship boards. Since its release the film's reputation has grown, and it has been hailed as Whale's masterpiece. In 1998, the film was added to the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>, having been deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".

On a stormy night, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> (<a href="Douglas%20Walton%20%28actor%29">Douglas Walton</a>) and <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> (<a href="Gavin%20Gordon%20%28actor%29">Gavin Gordon</a>) praise <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> (<a href="Elsa%20Lanchester">Elsa Lanchester</a>) for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster. Reminding them that her intention was to impart a moral lesson, Mary says she has more of the story to tell. The scene shifts to the end of the 1931 "Frankenstein", in 1899.

Villagers gathered around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster (<a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>). Their joy is tempered by the realization that <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Henry Frankenstein</a> (<a href="Colin%20Clive">Colin Clive</a>) is also apparently dead. Hans (<a href="Reginald%20Barlow">Reginald Barlow</a>), father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, wants to see the Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster – having survived the fire – strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (<a href="Mary%20Gordon%20%28actor%29">Mary Gordon</a>) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (<a href="Una%20O%27Connor%20%28actress%29">Una O'Connor</a>), who flees in terror.

Henry's body is returned to his fiancée Elizabeth (<a href="Valerie%20Hobson">Valerie Hobson</a>) at his ancestral castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she sees death coming, foreshadowing the arrival of Henry's former mentor, <a href="Doctor%20Septimus%20Pretorius">Doctor Septimus Pretorius</a> (<a href="Ernest%20Thesiger">Ernest Thesiger</a>). In his rooms, Pretorius shows Henry several <a href="Homunculus">homunculi</a> he has created, including a miniature <a href="Queen%20regnant">queen</a>, <a href="Monarch">king</a>, <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>, <a href="devil">devil</a>, <a href="ballerina">ballerina</a>, and <a href="mermaid">mermaid</a>. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster and offers a toast to their venture: "To a new world of gods and monsters!" Upon forcing Henry to help him, Pretorius will grow an artificial brain while Henry gathers the parts for the mate.

The Monster saves a young shepherdess (Anne Darling) from drowning. Her screams upon seeing him alert two hunters, who shoot and injure the creature. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, kills the guards and escapes into the woods.

That night, the Monster encounters a gypsy family and burns his hand in their campfire. Following the sound of a violin playing "<a href="Ave%20Maria%20%28Bach/Gounod%29">Ave Maria</a>", the Monster encounters an old blind <a href="hermit">hermit</a> (<a href="O.%20P.%20Heggie">O. P. Heggie</a>) who thanks God for sending him a friend. He teaches the monster words like "friend" and "good" and shares a meal with him. Two lost hunters stumble upon the cottage and recognize the Monster. He attacks them and accidentally burns down the cottage as the hunters lead the hermit away.

Taking refuge from another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius and his cronies Karl (<a href="Dwight%20Frye">Dwight Frye</a>) and Ludwig (<a href="Ted%20Billings">Ted Billings</a>) breaking open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius stays to enjoy a light supper. The Monster approaches Pretorius, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him.

Henry and Elizabeth, now married, are visited by Pretorius. He is ready for Henry to do his part in their "supreme collaboration". Henry refuses and Pretorius calls in the Monster who demands Henry's help. Henry again refuses and Pretorius orders the Monster out, secretly signaling him to kidnap Elizabeth. Pretorius guarantees her safe return upon Henry's participation. Henry returns to his tower laboratory where in spite of himself he grows excited over his work. After being assured of Elizabeth's safety, Henry completes the <a href="Bride%20of%20Frankenstein%20%28character%29">Bride</a>'s body.

A storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandage-wrapped body is raised through the roof. Lightning strikes a kite, sending electricity through the Bride. Henry and Pretorius lower her and realize their success. "She's alive! Alive!" Henry cries. They remove her bandages and help her to stand. "The bride of Frankenstein!" Doctor Pretorius declares.

The Monster comes down the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate (<a href="Elsa%20Lanchester">Elsa Lanchester</a>). The excited Monster reaches out to her, asking, "Friend?" The Bride, screaming, rejects him. "She hate me! Like others" the Monster dejectedly says. As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster rampages through the laboratory. The Monster tells Henry and Elizabeth "Yes! Go! You live!" To Pretorius and the Bride, he says "You stay. We belong dead." While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Monster sheds a tear and pulls a lever to trigger the destruction of the laboratory and tower.

Universal considered making a sequel to "Frankenstein" as early as its 1931 preview screenings, following which the film's original ending was changed to allow for Henry Frankenstein's survival. James Whale initially refused to direct "Bride", believing he had "squeezed the idea dry" on the first film. Following the success of Whale's "<a href="The%20Invisible%20Man%20%281933%20film%29">The Invisible Man</a>", producer <a href="Carl%20Laemmle%2C%20Jr.">Carl Laemmle, Jr.</a> realized that Whale was the only possible director for "Bride"; Whale took advantage of the situation in persuading the studio to let him make "<a href="One%20More%20River">One More River</a>". Whale believed the sequel would not top the original, so he decided instead to make it a memorable "hoot". According to a studio publicist, Whale and Universal's studio psychiatrist decided "the Monster would have the mental age of a ten-year old boy and the emotional age of a lad of fifteen".

Screenwriter <a href="Robert%20Florey">Robert Florey</a> wrote a <a href="Film%20treatment">treatment</a> entitled "The New Adventures of Frankenstein — The Monster Lives!", but it was rejected without comment early in 1932. Universal staff writer Tom Reed wrote a treatment under the title "The Return of Frankenstein", a title retained until filming began. Following its acceptance in 1933, Reed wrote a full script that was submitted to the <a href="Production%20Code">Hays office</a> for review. The script passed its review, but Whale, who by then had been contracted to direct, complained that "it stinks to heaven". <a href="Lawrence%20Blochman">L. G. Blochman</a> and <a href="Philip%20MacDonald">Philip MacDonald</a> were the next writers assigned, but Whale also found their work unsatisfactory. In 1934, Whale set <a href="John%20L.%20Balderston">John L. Balderston</a> to work on yet another version, and it was he who returned to an incident from the novel in which the creature demands a mate. In the novel Frankenstein creates a mate, but destroys it without bringing it to life. Balderston also created the Mary Shelley prologue. After several months Whale was still not satisfied with Balderston's work and handed the project to playwright William J. Hurlbut and <a href="Edmund%20Pearson">Edmund Pearson</a>. The final script, combining elements of a number of these versions, was submitted for Hays office review in November 1934. <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> reports that Whale planned to make Elizabeth the heart donor for the bride, but film historian Scott MacQueen states that Whale never had such an intention.

Sources report that <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> and <a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a> were considered, with varying degrees of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created specifically for Ernest Thesiger. Because of <a href="Mae%20Clarke">Mae Clarke</a>'s ill health, <a href="Valerie%20Hobson">Valerie Hobson</a> replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story — and horror in general — springs from the dark side of the imagination. He considered <a href="Brigitte%20Helm">Brigitte Helm</a> and <a href="Phyllis%20Brooks">Phyllis Brooks</a> before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a> to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including "<a href="The%20Private%20Life%20of%20Henry%20VIII">The Private Life of Henry VIII</a>" (for which he had won an <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscar</a>) and Whale's own "<a href="The%20Old%20Dark%20House">The Old Dark House</a>". Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.

Colin Clive and Boris Karloff reprised their roles from "Frankenstein" as creator and creation, respectively. Hobson recalled Clive's alcoholism had worsened since filming the original, but Whale did not recast the role because his "hysterical quality" was necessary for the film. Karloff strongly objected to the decision to allow the Monster to speak. "Speech! Stupid! My argument was that if the monster had any impact or charm, it was because he was inarticulate – this great, lumbering, inarticulate creature. The moment he spoke you might as well ... play it straight." This decision also meant that Karloff could not remove his dental plate, so now his cheeks did not have the sunken look of the original film. Whale and the studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for the Monster's vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio. Dwight Frye returned to play the doctor's assistant, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the original. Frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and the role of "Nephew Glutz", a man who murdered his uncle and blamed the death on the Monster. Boris Karloff is credited simply as KARLOFF, which was Universal's custom during the height of his career. Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, but in a nod to the earlier film, the Monster's bride is credited only as "?" just as Boris Karloff had been in the opening credits of "Frankenstein".

Universal makeup artist <a href="Jack%20Pierce%20%28makeup%20artist%29">Jack Pierce</a> paid special attention to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's <a href="Secular%20icon">iconic</a> hair style, based on <a href="Nefertiti">Nefertiti</a>. Lanchester's hair was given a <a href="Perm%20%28hairstyle%29">Marcel wave</a> over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said "really did feel that he made these people, like he was a god ... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation." To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make. Lanchester said of her bride costume, "I drank as little liquid as possible. It was too much of an ordeal to go to the bathroom--all those bandages--and having to be accompanied by my dresser."

<a href="Kenneth%20Strickfaden">Kenneth Strickfaden</a> created and maintained the laboratory equipment. Strickfaden recycled a number of the fancifully named machines he had created for the original "Frankenstein" for use in "Bride", including the "Cosmic Ray Diffuser", and the "Nebularium". A lightning bolt generated by Strickfaden's equipment has become a <a href="Stock%20footage">stock</a> scene, appearing in any number of films and television shows. The man behind the film's special photographic effects was <a href="John%20P.%20Fulton">John P. Fulton</a>, head of the special effects department at Universal Studios at the time. Fulton and David S. Horsely created the homunculi over the course of two days by shooting the actors in full-size jars against black velvet and aligning them with the perspective of the on-set jars. The foreground film plate was <a href="rotoscope">rotoscope</a>d and <a href="Matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matted</a> onto the rear plate. Diminutive actor <a href="Billy%20Barty">Billy Barty</a> is briefly visible from the back in the finished film as a homunculus infant in a high chair, but Whale cut the infant's reveal before the film's release.

Whale met <a href="Franz%20Waxman">Franz Waxman</a> at a party and asked him to score the picture. "Nothing will be resolved in this picture except the end destruction scene. Would you write an unresolved score for it?" asked Whale. Waxman created three distinctive themes: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale's suggestion, with a powerful dissonant chord, intended to convey the idea that the on-screen explosion was so powerful that the theater where the film was being screened was affected by it. Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted 22 musicians to record the score in a single nine-hour session.

Shooting began on January 2, 1935, with a projected budget of US$293,750 ($ as of ) – almost exactly the budget of the original – and an estimated 36-day shooting schedule. On the first day, Karloff waded in the water below the destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume. Air got into the suit and expanded it like an "obscene water lilly". Later that day, Karloff broke his hip, necessitating a stunt double. Clive had also broken his leg. Shooting was completed on March 7, 1935. The film was ten days over schedule because Whale shut down the picture for ten days until Heggie became available to play the Hermit. With a final cost of $397,023 ($ as of ), "Bride" was more than $100,000 ($ as of ) over budget. As originally filmed, Henry died fleeing the exploding castle. Whale re-shot the ending to allow for their survival, although Clive is still visible on-screen in the collapsing laboratory. Whale completed his final cut, shortening the running time from about 90 to 75 minutes and re-shooting and re-editing the ending, only days before the film's scheduled premiere date.

"Bride of Frankenstein" was subjected to <a href="Film%20censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censorship</a>, both during production by the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code">Hays office</a> and following its release by local and national censorship boards. <a href="Joseph%20Breen">Joseph Breen</a>, lead censor for the Hays office, objected to lines of dialogue in the originally submitted script in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were compared to that of God. He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts, and to a planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to "rescue" the figure from the cross. Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number. The censor's office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye's "Nephew Glutz" kills his uncle and blames the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much of her breasts were visible. Curiously, despite his earlier objection, Breen offered no objection to the <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> imagery throughout the film – including a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a pole – nor to the presentation of Pretorius as a coded <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>. "Bride of Frankenstein" was approved by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935.

Following its release with the Code seal of approval, the film was challenged by the censorship board in the state of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>. Censors in England and <a href="China">China</a> objected to the scene in which the Monster gazes longingly upon the as-yet unanimated body of the Bride, citing concerns that it looked like <a href="necrophilia">necrophilia</a>. Universal voluntarily withdrew the film from <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> because of the extensive cuts demanded, and "Bride" was rejected outright by <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, and <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>. One unusual objection, from Japanese censors, was that the scene in which Pretorius chases his miniature <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> with tweezers constituted "making a fool out of a king".

"Bride of Frankenstein" was profitable for Universal, with a 1943 report showing that the film had by then earned approximately $2 million ($ in money) for the studio, a profit of about $950,000 ($ as of ). The film was critically praised upon its release, although some reviewers did qualify their opinions based on the film's being in the horror genre. The "<a href="New%20York%20World-Telegram">New York World-Telegram</a>" called the film "good entertainment of its kind". The "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" described it as "a grotesque, gruesome tale which, of its kind, is swell". "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" similarly called the film "a joy for those who can appreciate it".

"<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" did not so qualify its review. "[It is] one of those rare instances where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." "Variety" also praised the cast, writing that "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching ... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [is] a diabolic characterization if ever there was one ... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly."

In another unqualified review, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" wrote that the film had "a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture ... Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was "Frankenstein"." The "<a href="Oakland%20Tribune">Oakland Tribune</a>" concurred it was "a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects". While the "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" thought that the electrical equipment might have been better suited to <a href="Buck%20Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as "exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome", declaring that "All who enjoyed "Frankenstein" will welcome his "Bride" as a worthy successor." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called Karloff "so splendid in the role that all one can say is 'he is the Monster. The "Times" praised the entire principal cast and Whale's direction in concluding that "Bride" is "a first-rate horror film", and presciently suggested that "The Monster should become an institution, like <a href="Charlie%20Chan">Charlie Chan</a>." "Bride" was nominated for one <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, for Best Sound Recording (<a href="Gilbert%20Kurland">Gilbert Kurland</a>).

The film's reputation has persisted and grown since its release. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "An eccentric, campy, technically impressive, and frightening picture, James Whale's "Bride of Frankenstein" has aged remarkably well." In 1998, the film was added to the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>, having been deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". Frequently identified as James Whale's masterpiece, the film is lauded as "the finest of all <a href="gothic%20horror">gothic horror</a> movies". "Time" rated "Bride of Frankenstein" in its "<a href="Time%20magazine%27s%20%26quot%3BAll-TIME%26quot%3B%20100%20best%20movies">ALL-TIME 100 Movies</a>", in which critics <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> and <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> overruled the magazine's original review to declare the film "one of those rare sequels that is infinitely superior to its source". In 2008, "Bride" was selected by "<a href="Empire%20Magazine">Empire</a>" magazine as one of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time". Also in 2008, the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" named it the second greatest horror film after "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>". In 2016, James Charisma of "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" ranked the film #7 on a list of "15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" considers the film superior to "Frankenstein".

<a href="Christian%20symbolism">Christian imagery</a> appears throughout the film. In addition to the scenes of the Monster trussed in a cruciform pose and the crucified figure of Jesus in the graveyard, the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> figure-looking hermit has a <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a> on the wall of his hut – which, to Whale's consternation, editor Ted Kent made glow during a fade-out – and the Monster consumes the Christian <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s of bread and wine at his "last supper" with the hermit. Horror scholar <a href="David%20J.%20Skal">David J. Skal</a> suggests that Whale's intention was to make a "direct comparison of Frankenstein's monster to Christ". Film scholar Scott MacQueen, noting Whale's lack of any religious convictions, disputes the notion that the Monster is a Christ-figure. Rather, the Monster is a "mockery of the divine" since, having been created by Man rather than God, it "lacks the divine spark". In crucifying the Monster, he says, Whale "pushes the audience's buttons" by inverting the central Christian belief of the death of Christ followed by the resurrection. The Monster is raised from the dead first, then crucified.

In the decades since its release, modern film scholars have noted the possible <a href="queer">queer</a> reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, and some of the actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a>. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay <a href="subtext">subtext</a> suffused through the film, especially a <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.

Gay film historian <a href="Vito%20Russo">Vito Russo</a>, in considering Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring to him as "<a href="sissy">sissified</a>", "sissy" itself being Hollywood code for "homosexual". Pretorius serves as a "gay <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a>", a figure of seduction and temptation, going so far as to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of creating non-procreative life. A novelization of the film published in England made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way."

The Monster, whose affections for the male hermit and the female Bride he discusses with identical language ("friend") has been read as sexually "unsettled" and bisexual. Gender studies author Elizabeth Young writes: "He has no innate understanding that the male-female bond he is to forge with the bride is assumed to be the primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with [Pretorius and the hermit]: all affective relationships are as easily 'friendships' as 'marriages'." Indeed, his relationship with the hermit has been interpreted as a same-sex marriage that heterosexual society will not tolerate: "No mistake – this is a marriage, and a viable one ... But Whale reminds us quickly that society does not approve. The monster – the outsider – is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun-toting rubes who happen upon this startling alliance and quickly, instinctively, proceed to destroy it", writes cultural critic Gary Morris for "Bright Lights Film Journal". The creation of the Bride scene, Morris continues, is "Whale's reminder to the audience – his Hollywood bosses, peers, and everyone watching – of the majesty and power of the homosexual creator".

Filmmaker <a href="Curtis%20Harrington">Curtis Harrington</a>, a friend and confidant of Whale's, dismissed this as "a younger critic's evaluation. All artists do work that comes out of the unconscious mind and later on you can analyze it and say the symbolism may mean something, but artists don't think that way and I would bet my life that James Whale would never have had such concepts in mind." Specifically in response to the "majesty and power" reading, Harrington stated, "My opinion is that's just pure <a href="bullshit">bullshit</a>. That's a critical interpretation that has nothing to do with the original inspiration." He concludes, "I think the closest you can come to a homosexual metaphor in his films is to identify that certain sort of camp humor." Whale's companion <a href="David%20Lewis%20%28producer%29">David Lewis</a> stated flatly that Whale's sexual orientation was "not germane" to his filmmaking, saying, "Jimmy was first and foremost an artist, and his films represent the work of an artist – not a gay artist, but an artist."

Universal Pictures has sought to remake "Bride of Frankenstein" on several occasions. While the novel "Frankenstein" has been adapted to film many times, "Bride of Frankenstein"s closest remake was "<a href="The%20Bride%20%281985%20film%29">The Bride</a>" (1985), starring <a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a>, <a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a>, and <a href="Jennifer%20Beals">Jennifer Beals</a>. In 1991, the studio sought to remake the film for cable television, and <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> expressed interest in directing.

In the first decade of the 21st century, Universal paired with <a href="Imagine%20Entertainment">Imagine Entertainment</a> and contracted <a href="Shari%20Springer%20Berman%20and%20Robert%20Pulcini">Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini</a>, who wrote the screenplay for "<a href="American%20Splendor%20%28film%29">American Splendor</a>", to write a remake. The screenwriters set the story in contemporary New York. <a href="Jacob%20Aaron%20Estes">Jacob Estes</a> was also involved with the project at one point and wrote a draft. In June 2009, Universal and Imagine entered discussions with director <a href="Neil%20Burger">Neil Burger</a> and his writing partner <a href="Dirk%20Wittenborn">Dirk Wittenborn</a>, and producer <a href="Brian%20Grazer">Brian Grazer</a> was assigned to oversee the development of the remake. 

In December 2015, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported that <a href="David%20Koepp">David Koepp</a> will write the script. In May 2017, Universal Pictures announced their shared universe film series of rebooted, modern-day interpretations of their classic <a href="Universal%20Monsters">Universal Monsters</a> titled, <a href="Universal_Classic_Monsters%23Dark_Universe">Dark Universe</a>. The film series began with the 2017 film "<a href="The%20Mummy%20%282017%20film%29">The Mummy</a>", and is expected to continue with "Bride of Frankenstein" on February 14, 2019 with <a href="Bill%20Condon">Bill Condon</a> directing the film, but Universal and Condon have decided to postpone this movie. By October 2017, it was reported that pre-production had begun when the creative team and studio decided to postpone the release in order to further work on the script with intentions being to improve the story. "Deadline" reported that <a href="Javier%20Bardem">Javier Bardem</a> and <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> are still attached to the movie as <a href="Frankenstein%27s%20monster">Frankenstein's monster</a> and the film's <a href="Bride%20of%20Frankenstein%20%28character%29">reluctant bride</a>, respectively. The same month Condon stated that should Jolie decide to leave the project, he would be interested in seeing <a href="Gal%20Gadot">Gal Gadot</a> play the titular character. But on November 8, 2017, <a href="Alex%20Kurtzman">Alex Kurtzman</a> and <a href="Chris%20Morgan%20%28writer%29">Chris Morgan</a> moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the "Dark Universe" in doubt.

In January 2018, it was reported that Condon was assembling a production team, consisting of cinematographer <a href="Tobias%20A.%20Schliessler">Tobias A. Schliessler</a>, production designer <a href="Sarah%20Greenwood">Sarah Greenwood</a>, composer <a href="Carter%20Burwell">Carter Burwell</a>, and costume designer <a href="Jacqueline%20Durran">Jacqueline Durran</a>.

In these films we see a scene of "Bride" broadcast on <a href="TV">TV</a>.

The working title, "Bride of the Atom", and the final title of the film "<a href="Bride%20of%20the%20Monster">Bride of the Monster</a>" from 1955 allude to the earlier film "Bride of Frankenstein".

To Kill a Mockingbird

To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by <a href="Harper%20Lee">Harper Lee</a> published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>, and has become a classic of modern <a href="American%20literature">American literature</a>. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of <a href="Monroeville%2C%20Alabama">Monroeville, Alabama</a>, in 1936, when she was 10 years old.
The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of <a href="rape">rape</a> and <a href="racial%20inequality%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial inequality</a>. The narrator's father, <a href="Atticus%20Finch">Atticus Finch</a>, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Historian, J Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."

As a <a href="Southern%20Gothic">Southern Gothic</a> and "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>" novel, the primary themes of "To Kill a Mockingbird" involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the American <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, "To Kill a Mockingbird" has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often <a href="Challenge%20%28literature%29">challenged</a> for its use of racial <a href="epithet">epithet</a>s.

Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of "To Kill a Mockingbird" by several authors and public figures, calls the book "an astonishing phenomenon". In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> as one "every adult should read before they die". It was adapted into <a href="To%20Kill%20a%20Mockingbird%20%28film%29">an Academy Award-winning film</a> in 1962 by director <a href="Robert%20Mulligan">Robert Mulligan</a>, with a screenplay by <a href="Horton%20Foote">Horton Foote</a>. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.

"To Kill a Mockingbird" was Lee's only published book until "<a href="Go%20Set%20a%20Watchman">Go Set a Watchman</a>", an earlier <a href="Draft%20document">draft</a> of "To Kill a Mockingbird", was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.

Born in 1926, <a href="Harper%20Lee">Harper Lee</a> grew up in the Southern town of <a href="Monroeville%2C%20Alabama">Monroeville, Alabama</a>, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>. She attended <a href="Huntingdon%20College">Huntingdon College</a> in <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a> (1944–45), and then studied law at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a> (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: "Huntress" at Huntingdon and the humor magazine "Rammer Jammer" at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a>; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a <a href="literary%20agent">literary agent</a> recommended by Capote. An editor at <a href="J.%20B.%20Lippincott%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J. B. Lippincott</a>, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.

Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterruptedly for a year. After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled "Go Set a Watchman", fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally as <a href="Tay%20Hohoff">Tay Hohoff</a>. Hohoff was impressed, "[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line," she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott, but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel." During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.

After the "Watchman" title was rejected, it was re-titled "Atticus" but Lee renamed it "To Kill a Mockingbird" to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said,

I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.

Instead of a "quick and merciful death", "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest%20Condensed%20Books">Reader's Digest Condensed Books</a>" chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.

The story, told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933–35) of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. Jean Louise Finch, nicknamed Scout, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated by their neighbor, the <a href="recluse">reclusive</a> Arthur "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.

Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This crisis is averted in an unexpected manner. Scout, Jem, and Dill show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks the <a href="Herd%20mentality">mob mentality</a> by recognizing and talking to a classmate's father, and the would-be lynchers disperse.

Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes invites Jem, Scout, and Dill to watch from the <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Public%20facilities">colored balcony</a>. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the <a href="town%20drunk">town drunk</a>—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Everyone knows that the <a href="white%20trash">white trash</a> Ewells are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom anyway. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.

Despite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he "destroyed [Ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial." Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house, and menacing Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after the school <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.

Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff decides that, to protect Boo's privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears again, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective.

Lee has said that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is not an <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>, but rather an example of how an author "should write about what he knows and write truthfully". Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a <a href="neurosis">nervous condition</a> that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent. Lee's older brother Edwin was the inspiration for Jem.

Lee modeled the character of Dill on <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>, her childhood friend known then as Truman Persons. Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City. Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote loved to read, and were atypical children in some ways: Lee was a scrappy <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a> who was quick to fight, and Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old <a href="Underwood%20Typewriter%20Company">Underwood</a> typewriter that Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them "apart people". In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote's <a href="nonfiction%20novel">nonfiction novel</a> "<a href="In%20Cold%20Blood">In Cold Blood</a>".

Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.

The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper, which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1937. Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the <a href="Scottsboro%20Boys">Scottsboro Boys</a>, in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served "the same purpose" to display Southern <a href="prejudice">prejudice</a>s. <a href="Emmett%20Till">Emmett Till</a>, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, is also considered a model for Tom.

The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which in an early review in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" was called "tactile brilliance". Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, "Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition." Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a "delightfully deceptive" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic <a href="Granville%20Hicks">Granville Hicks</a> expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.

Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: "Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at." Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses <a href="parody">parody</a>, <a href="satire">satire</a>, and <a href="irony">irony</a> effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.

Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of <a href="Shadrach%2C%20Meshach%2C%20and%20Abednego">Shadrach</a>. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.

Scholars have characterized "To Kill a Mockingbird" as both a <a href="Southern%20Gothic">Southern Gothic</a> and a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>". The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of the <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a> in the novel. Lee used the term "Gothic" to describe the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">architecture</a> of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to "<a href="Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye">Catcher in the Rye</a>" and "<a href="Adventures%20of%20Huckleberry%20Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>". Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a>. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, <a href="incest">incest</a>, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town <a href="Literary%20realism">realistically</a> rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.

As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, ""To Kill a Mockingbird" can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be."

Despite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is "an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined". Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller ("If that many people like it, it can't be any good.") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.

Harper Lee had remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused:Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that "To Kill a Mockingbird" spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners."

When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic <a href="American%20literary%20regionalism">regionalism</a>. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern <a href="caste%20system">caste system</a> to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a> (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of "fine folks" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. <a href="Southern%20United%20States">The South</a> itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.

The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed "the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered "To Kill a Mockingbird" a novel primarily concerned with <a href="race%20relations">race relations</a>. <a href="Claudia%20Durst%20Johnson">Claudia Durst Johnson</a> considers it "reasonable to believe" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 <a href="Montgomery%20Bus%20Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>, and the 1956 riots at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a> after <a href="Autherine%20Lucy">Autherine Lucy</a> and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: ""To Kill a Mockingbird" was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition."

Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests <a href="Emmett%20Till">Emmett Till</a> was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the "mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood". Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in "To Kill a Mockingbird" was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as "stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him". Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.

The theme of racial injustice appears <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a <a href="Rabies">rabid</a> dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike <a href="imagery%20%28literature%29">imagery</a> from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, "[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson ... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger."

In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was "to be ... the <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> of South Alabama." Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: "affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status".

Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation." Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of <a href="nostalgia">nostalgia</a>. Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative <a href="Antebellum%20era">antebellum</a> Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.

The novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of <a href="courage">courage</a>. Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage. In a statement that both <a href="Foreshadowing">foreshadows</a> Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a <a href="morphine">morphine</a> addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is "when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what".

<a href="Charles%20J.%20Shields">Charles J. Shields</a>, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal". Atticus' lesson to Scout that "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it" exemplifies his compassion. She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. One writer remarks, "... [w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings."

Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and <a href="camisole">camisole</a>, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child."

Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: "It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight."

<a href="Allusion">Allusion</a>s to legal issues in "To Kill a Mockingbird", particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that "a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a> reads: "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once." Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's "fanatical" attempts to place her in them made her feel "a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]". Johnson states, "[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds."

Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their <a href="Surname">family name</a> <a href="Finch">Finch</a> is also Lee's mother's <a href="Surname">maiden name</a>. The titular <a href="Northern%20mockingbird">mockingbird</a> is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson." Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.

Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice," to which he responds, "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."

The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>. In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting <a href="irony">irony</a>. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and "reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races" while giving the "appearance of gentility, piety, and morality". Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.

Despite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama. The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Month%20Club">Book of the Month Club</a> and editions released by "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest%20Condensed%20Books">Reader's Digest Condensed Books</a>".

Initial reactions to the novel were varied. "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" declared Lee "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer", and "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer rated the book "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life" and calls Scout Finch "the most appealing child since <a href="Carson%20McCullers">Carson McCullers</a>' Frankie got left behind at the <a href="The%20Member%20of%20the%20Wedding">wedding</a>". The "Chicago Sunday Tribune" noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: "This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause ... "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a novel of strong contemporary national significance."

Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners, and one-dimensional black victims, and <a href="Granville%20Hicks">Granville Hicks</a> labeled the book "<a href="melodramatic">melodramatic</a> and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer <a href="Flannery%20O%27Connor">Flannery O'Connor</a> commented, "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the "Time" magazine review, writing to a cousin: "Well, honey, one thing we know is that she's been poaching on my literary preserves."

One year after its publication "To Kill a Mockingbird" had been translated into ten languages. In the years since, it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback, and has become part of the standard literature curriculum. A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9–12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades. A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> Center for the Book found that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was rated behind only the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> in books that are "most often cited as making a difference". It is considered by some to be the "<a href="Great%20American%20Novel">Great American Novel</a>".

The 50th anniversary of the novel's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact. <a href="Eric%20Zorn">Eric Zorn</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" praises Lee's "rich use of language" but writes that the central lesson is that "courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style". Jane Sullivan in the "Sydney Morning Herald" agrees, stating that the book "still rouses fresh and horrified indignation" as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. <a href="Chimamanda%20Ngozi%20Adichie">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a> writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with "a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question", comparing her to <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, who wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Glasgow%29">The Herald</a>" notes the connections between Lee and <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, stating the book's central theme, that "one's moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled" is eloquently discussed.

Native Alabamian sports writer <a href="Allen%20Barra">Allen Barra</a> sharply criticized Lee and the novel in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" calling Atticus a "repository of cracker-barrel epigrams" and the novel represents a "sugar-coated myth" of Alabama history. Barra writes, "It's time to stop pretending that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated". <a href="Thomas%20Mallon">Thomas Mallon</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" criticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout "a kind of highly constructed doll" whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee's "wildly unstable" narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that "the book has begun to cherish its own goodness" by the time the case is over. Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice "is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all." Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.

Many writers compare their perceptions of "To Kill a Mockingbird" as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a href="Rosanne%20Cash">Rosanne Cash</a>, <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a>, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled "Scout, Atticus, and Boo".

One of the most significant impacts "To Kill a Mockingbird" has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, "Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person." <a href="Morris%20Dees">Morris Dees</a> of the <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and <a href="Richard%20Matsch">Richard Matsch</a>, the federal judge who presided over the <a href="Timothy%20McVeigh">Timothy McVeigh</a> trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One law professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was "To Kill a Mockingbird", and an article in the "<a href="Michigan%20Law%20Review">Michigan Law Review</a>" claims, "No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," before questioning whether "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".

In 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="sexism">sexism</a> and should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero. Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb. However, in 1997, the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Bar">Alabama State Bar</a> erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the "first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history". In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who "has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor".

"To Kill a Mockingbird" has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> reported that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was number 21 of the 100 most frequently <a href="Challenge%20%28literature%29">challenged</a> books of 2000–2009. Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and <a href="Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi">Biloxi</a> in 2017, where it was described as making people "uncomfortable". In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists. Becky Little of <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">The History Channel</a> and representatives of the <a href="Mark%20Twain%20House">Mark Twain House</a> pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to "challenge the way we think about things" (<a href="Mark%20Twain">Twain's</a> "<a href="Adventures%20of%20Huckleberry%20Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>" has attracted similar controversy). <a href="Arne%20Duncan">Arne Duncan</a>, who served as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Education">Secretary of Education</a> under <a href="Barack%20Obama">President Obama</a>, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with "real problems". In 1966, a parent in <a href="Hanover%2C%20Virginia">Hanover, Virginia</a> protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape. Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to "The Richmond News Leader" suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of "the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice". The <a href="National%20Education%20Association">National Education Association</a> in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—after "<a href="Little%20Black%20Sambo">Little Black Sambo</a>".

With a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s, "To Kill a Mockingbird" faced challenges of a different sort: the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough. This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, but a more ambiguous reception by black readers. In one high-profile case outside the U.S., school districts in the Canadian provinces of <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s, stating:

Furthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined. In its use of racial epithets, <a href="stereotype">stereotype</a>d depictions of <a href="Superstition">superstitious</a> blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the "<a href="Uncle%20Tom">contented slave</a>" motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice "functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society". A teaching guide for the novel published by "The English Journal" cautions, "what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another". A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it "demoralizing". Another criticism, articulated by <a href="Michael%20Lind">Michael Lind</a>, is that the novel indulges in <a href="classism">classist</a> stereotyping and <a href="demonization">demonization</a> of poor rural "<a href="white%20trash">white trash</a>".

The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> in the 1960s, however, in that it "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader <a href="Andrew%20Young">Andrew Young</a> comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as "an act of humanity" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author <a href="Mark%20Childress">Mark Childress</a> compares it to the impact of "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>", a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel

gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view.

<a href="Diane%20McWhorter">Diane McWhorter</a>, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the <a href="Birmingham%20campaign">Birmingham civil rights campaign</a>, asserts that "To Kill a Mockingbird" condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial <a href="cognitive%20dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." Author <a href="James%20McBride%20%28writer%29">James McBride</a> calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave:

I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel ... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches.

McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with "honesty and integrity".

During the years immediately following the novel's publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, when "To Kill a Mockingbird" was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the <a href="1961%20Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>, stunning Lee. It also won the Brotherhood Award of the <a href="National%20Conference%20of%20Christians%20and%20Jews">National Conference of Christians and Jews</a> in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from "Bestsellers" magazine in 1962. Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought. Since then, she declined talking with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. "Mockingbird" still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble."

In 2001, Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor. In the same year, Chicago mayor <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a> initiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book, "To Kill a Mockingbird", as the first title of the <a href="One%20city%20one%20book">One City, One Book</a> program. Lee declared that "there is no greater honor the novel could receive". By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25 communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised <a href="One%20City%20One%20Book%23USA">The Big Read</a>, states "people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it."

In 2006, Lee was awarded an <a href="honorary%20doctorate">honorary doctorate</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>. During the ceremony, the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation, and the entire graduating class held up copies of "To Kill a Mockingbird" to honor her. Lee was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> on November 5, 2007 by President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. In his remarks, Bush stated, "One reason "To Kill a Mockingbird" succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author, which comes through on every page ... "To Kill a Mockingbird" has influenced the character of our country for the better. It's been a gift to the entire world. As a model of good writing and humane sensibility, this book will be read and studied forever."

After remaining at number one throughout the entire five-month-long voting period in 2018, the American public, via <a href="PBS">PBS's</a> "The Great American Read", chose "To Kill A Mockingbird" as America's Favorite Book.

An earlier draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird", titled "<a href="Go%20Set%20a%20Watchman">Go Set a Watchman</a>", was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in "To Kill a Mockingbird" but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult <a href="Scout%20Finch">Scout Finch</a> who travels from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to visit her father, <a href="Atticus%20Finch">Atticus Finch</a>, in <a href="Maycomb%2C%20Alabama">Maycomb, Alabama</a>, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The "Watchman" manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it, but this claim has been widely disputed. "Watchman" contains early versions of many of the characters from "To Kill a Mockingbird". According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, "Mockingbird" was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: "They discussed publishing "Mockingbird" first, "Watchman" last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two." This assertion has been discredited, however, by rare-books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird". Nurnberg's statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how "Watchman" was seen as just the first draft of "Mockingbird".
Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.

The book was made into the well-received 1962 film <a href="To%20Kill%20a%20Mockingbird%20%28film%29">with the same title</a>, starring <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a> as Atticus Finch. The film's producer, <a href="Alan%20J.%20Pakula">Alan J. Pakula</a>, remembered <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> executives questioning him about a potential script: "They said, 'What story do you plan to tell for the film?' I said, 'Have you read the book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'" The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscars</a>: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> for Gregory Peck, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Production%20Design">Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium</a> for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Actress in a Supporting Role</a> for <a href="Mary%20Badham">Mary Badham</a>, the actress who played Scout.
Lee was pleased with the film, "In that film the man and the part met ... I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art". Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release. Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's <a href="pocket%20watch">pocket watch</a>, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a>. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, she told him, "Well, it's only a watch". He said, "Harper—she feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things". Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made. Peck's grandson was named "Harper" in her honor.

In May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Public%20Library">Los Angeles Public Library</a> at the request of Peck's widow Veronique, who said of Lee:

She's like a national treasure. She's someone who has made a difference ... with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays. My husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him.

The book has also been adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself "The Literary Capital of Alabama". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated. Author <a href="Albert%20Murray%20%28writer%29">Albert Murray</a> said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): "It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of <a href="Mardi%20Gras">Mardi Gras</a>. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education—what Monroeville aspires to be."

Sergel's play toured in the UK starting at <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Playhouse">West Yorkshire Playhouse</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> in 2006, and again in 2011 starting at the <a href="York%20Theatre%20Royal">York Theatre Royal</a>, both productions featuring <a href="Duncan%20Preston">Duncan Preston</a> as Atticus Finch. The play also opened the 2013 season at <a href="Regent%27s%20Park%20Open%20Air%20Theatre">Regent's Park Open Air Theatre</a> in London where it played to full houses and starred <a href="Robert%20Sean%20Leonard">Robert Sean Leonard</a> as Atticus Finch, his first London appearance in 22 years. The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.

According to a "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>" article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because "she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame". To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named "Calpurnia's Cookbook" not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum. David Lister in "The Independent" states that Lee's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and her silence "makes <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> look like a media tart". Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them "Mockingbird groupies", and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic "Hell, no!"

A Christmas Carol

A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a <a href="novella">novella</a> by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, first published in London by <a href="Chapman%20%26amp%3B%20Hall">Chapman & Hall</a> in 1843 and illustrated by <a href="John%20Leech%20%28caricaturist%29">John Leech</a>. "A Christmas Carol" recounts the story of <a href="Ebenezer%20Scrooge">Ebenezer Scrooge</a>, an elderly <a href="miser">miser</a> who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner <a href="Jacob%20Marley">Jacob Marley</a> and the spirits of <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Past">Christmas Past</a>, <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Present">Present</a> and <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Yet%20to%20Come">Yet to Come</a>. After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.

Dickens wrote "A Christmas Carol" during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past <a href="Christmas%20traditions">Christmas traditions</a>, including <a href="Christmas%20carols">carols</a> and newer customs such as <a href="Christmas%20tree%2318th%20and%2019th%20centuries">Christmas trees</a>. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors including <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a> and <a href="Douglas%20Jerrold">Douglas Jerrold</a>. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane <a href="Ragged%20School">Ragged School</a>, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a <a href="Christian%20literature%23Christian%20allegory">Christian allegory</a>.

Published on 19 December, the first edition sold out by <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was <a href="Copyright%20infringement">illicitly copied</a> in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public readings of the story which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. "A Christmas Carol" has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story <a href="Adaptations%20of%20A%20Christmas%20Carol">has been adapted many times</a> for film, stage, opera and other media.

"A Christmas Carol" captured the <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of the <a href="Victorian%20era">mid-Victorian</a> revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens had acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.

The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled "<a href="Staff%20%28music%29">staves</a>".

"A Christmas Carol" opens on a bleak, cold <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> in London, seven years after the death of <a href="Ebenezer%20Scrooge">Ebenezer Scrooge</a>'s business partner, <a href="Jacob%20Marley">Jacob Marley</a>. Scrooge, an ageing <a href="miser">miser</a>, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred—the son of Fan, Scrooge's dead sister. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid <a href="clerk">clerk</a>, <a href="Bob%20Cratchit">Bob Cratchit</a>, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.

That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.

The first spirit, the <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Past">Ghost of Christmas Past</a>, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, <a href="Mr%20Fezziwig">Mr Fezziwig</a>, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing Belle's description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.

The second spirit, the <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Present">Ghost of Christmas Present</a>, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of <a href="Christmas%20dinner">Christmas dinner</a> and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, <a href="Tiny%20Tim%20%28A%20Christmas%20Carol%29">Tiny Tim</a>, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.

The third spirit, the <a href="Ghost%20of%20Christmas%20Yet%20to%20Come">Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come</a>, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His <a href="charwoman">charwoman</a>, <a href="Washerwoman">laundress</a> and the local <a href="undertaker">undertaker</a> steal his possessions to sell to a <a href="Fence%20%28criminal%29">fence</a>. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.

Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the day before, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon with Fred's family. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.

The writer <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John. In 1824 John was committed to the <a href="Marshalsea">Marshalsea</a>, a <a href="debtors%27%20prison">debtors' prison</a> in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to <a href="Pawnbroker">pawn</a> his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested <a href="shoe%20polish">shoe-blacking</a> factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a "deep personal and social outrage", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.

By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author, having written six major works, as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces. On 31 December that year he began publishing his novel "<a href="Martin%20Chuzzlewit">Martin Chuzzlewit</a>" as a monthly serial; the novel was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.

Celebrating the <a href="Christmas%20season">Christmas season</a> had been growing in popularity through the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. The <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>. Their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in <a href="Christmas%20carols">Christmas carols</a>, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of <a href="Davies%20Gilbert">Davies Gilbert</a>'s 1823 work "Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England" and <a href="William%20Sandys%20%28antiquarian%29">William Sandys's</a> 1833 collection "Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern" led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.

Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was "Christmas Festivities", published in "<a href="Bell%27s%20Weekly%20Messenger">Bell's Weekly Messenger</a>" in 1835; the story was then published as "A Christmas Dinner" in "<a href="Sketches%20by%20Boz">Sketches by Boz</a>" (1836). "The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel "<a href="The%20Pickwick%20Papers">The Pickwick Papers</a>". In the episode, a Mr Wardle relates the tale of Gabriel Grub, a lonely and mean-spirited <a href="Sexton%20%28office%29">sexton</a>, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited by <a href="goblin">goblin</a>s who show him the past and future. Slater considers that "the main elements of the "Carol" are present in the story", but not yet in a firm form. The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorial "<a href="Master%20Humphrey%27s%20Clock">Master Humphrey's Clock</a>". The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the "Goblins" story appears to be a prototype of "A Christmas Carol", all Dickens's earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.

Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>, whose 1819–20 work "<a href="The%20Sketch%20Book%20of%20Geoffrey%20Crayon%2C%20Gent.">The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.</a>" included four essays on old English <a href="Christmas%20traditions">Christmas traditions</a> that he experienced while staying at <a href="Aston%20Hall">Aston Hall</a> near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that they felt had been lost in the modern world.

Several works may have had an influence on the writing of "A Christmas Carol", including two <a href="Douglas%20Jerrold">Douglas Jerrold</a> essays: one from an 1841 issue of "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>", "How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas" and one from 1843, "The Beauties of the Police". More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.

Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the <a href="mining%20in%20Cornwall%20and%20Devon">Cornish tin mines</a>, where he was angered by seeing <a href="Child%20labour">children working</a> in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane <a href="Ragged%20School">Ragged School</a>, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.

In February 1843 the "Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission" was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> upon <a href="working%20class">working class</a> children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, "An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child", but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year. In March he wrote to Dr <a href="Thomas%20Southwood%20Smith">Southwood Smith</a>, one of the four commissioners responsible for the "Second Report", about his change in plans: "you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea".

In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the <a href="Manchester%20Athenaeum">Manchester Athenaeum</a>, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.

By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of "Martin Chuzzlewit" were falling off, and his wife, <a href="Catherine%20Dickens">Catherine</a>, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when <a href="Chapman%20%26amp%3B%20Hall">Chapman & Hall</a>, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further. He began "A Christmas Carol" in October 1843. Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being "written at white heat"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December. He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of around London. Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he "wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition". Slater says that "A Christmas Carol" was

intended to open its readers' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.

<a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens on "Sketches by Boz" (1836) and "<a href="Oliver%20Twist">Oliver Twist</a>" (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist <a href="John%20Leech%20%28caricaturist%29">John Leech</a>. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on "A Christmas Carol", and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text. Dickens's hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph "... and to Tiny Tim, who did "not" die"; this was added later, during the printing process.

The central character of "A Christmas Carol" is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender, described in the story as "a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!" Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty "is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.

Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric <a href="John%20Elwes%20%28politician%29">John Elwes</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a>, or <a href="Jemmy%20Wood">Jemmy Wood</a>, the owner of the <a href="Gloucester%20Old%20Bank">Gloucester Old Bank</a> and also known as "The Gloucester Miser". According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the <a href="demographer">demographer</a> and <a href="political%20economist">political economist</a> <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>, while the miser's questions "Are there no prisons? ... And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopher <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a>, "Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?"

There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works. <a href="Peter%20Ackroyd">Peter Ackroyd</a>, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is "a more fantastic image" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser. Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from "The Pickwick Papers" was also an influence when creating Scrooge. Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as "mean man".

When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign "Goodge and Marney", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to the <a href="Allegheny%20Commons%20%28Pittsburgh%29%23Western%20Penitentiary">Western Penitentiary</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time "A Christmas Carol" was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a <a href="ragged%20school">ragged school</a> in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>.

The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story. Davis considers Scrooge to be "a <a href="Proteus">protean</a> figure always in process of reformation"; Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who "possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities". Some writers, including Grace Moore, the Dickens scholar, consider that there is a Christian theme running through "A Christmas Carol", and that the novella should be seen as an <a href="Christian%20literature%23Christian%20allegory">allegory</a> of the Christian concept of <a href="Redemption%20%28theology%29">redemption</a>. Dickens's biographer, <a href="Claire%20Tomalin">Claire Tomalin</a> sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that "even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man". Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex; he based his beliefs and principles on the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. Dickens's statement that Marley "had no bowels" is a reference to the "bowels of compassion" mentioned in the <a href="First%20Epistle%20of%20John">First Epistle of John</a>, the reason for his eternal damnation.

Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a "secular vision of this sacred holiday". The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that "A Christmas Carol" shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend <a href="John%20Forster%20%28biographer%29">John Forster</a> as his ""Carol" philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside". From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores "the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects" of Dickens's ""Carol" philosophy" of <a href="charity%20%28virtue%29">charity</a> and <a href="altruism">altruism</a>.

Dickens wrote "A Christmas Carol" in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.

As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of "Martin Chuzzlewit", Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Production of "A Christmas Carol" was not without problems. The first printing contained drab olive <a href="endpapers">endpapers</a> that Dickens felt were unacceptable, and the publisher Chapman and Hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers, but, once replaced, those clashed with the title page, which was then redone. The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843. Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red <a href="Morocco%20leather">Morocco leather</a> and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.

Priced at five shillings (equal to £ in 2019 pounds), the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844. By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print. It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.

The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £ in 2019 pounds) rather than the £1,000 (equal to £ in 2019 pounds) he expected. A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.

According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of "A Christmas Carol" "were almost uniformly kind". "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" described how the story's "impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity" all put the reader "in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author". The critic from "<a href="The%20Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>", the literary magazine, considered it a "tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King." <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>, writing in "<a href="Fraser%27s%20Magazine">Fraser's Magazine</a>", described the book as "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'"

The poet <a href="Thomas%20Hood">Thomas Hood</a>, in <a href="Hood%27s%20Magazine%20and%20Comic%20Miscellany">his own journal</a>, wrote that "If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease." The reviewer for "<a href="Tait%27s%20Edinburgh%20Magazine">Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</a>"—<a href="Theodore%20Martin">Theodore Martin</a>, who was usually critical of Dickens's work—spoke well of "A Christmas Carol", noting it was "a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good". After Dickens's death, <a href="Margaret%20Oliphant">Margaret Oliphant</a> deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as "a new gospel" and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better. The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, "<a href="Christian%20Remembrancer">Christian Remembrancer</a>" thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos. The writer and social thinker <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as "mistletoe and pudding – neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds".

There were critics of the book. "<a href="The%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine">The New Monthly Magazine</a>" praised the story, but thought the book's physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly. An unnamed writer for "<a href="The%20Westminster%20Review">The Westminster Review</a>" mocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking "Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without".

Following criticism of the US in "<a href="American%20Notes">American Notes</a>" and "Martin Chuzzlewit", American readers were less enthusiastic at first, but by the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, copies of the book were in wide circulation. In 1863 "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the "old Christmas ... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today".

In January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for <a href="Twopence%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">twopence</a>. Dickens wrote to his solicitor

I have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must. ... Let us be the "sledge-hammer" in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.

Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis of <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs. The small profits Dickens earned from "A Christmas Carol" further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of <a href="Bradbury%20and%20Evans">Bradbury and Evans</a>, who had been printing his works to that point.

Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories "<a href="The%20Chimes">The Chimes</a>" (1844), "<a href="The%20Cricket%20on%20the%20Hearth">The Cricket on the Hearth</a>" (1845), "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Life">The Battle of Life</a>" (1846) and "<a href="The%20Haunted%20Man%20and%20the%20Ghost%27s%20Bargain">The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain</a>" (1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.

By 1849 Dickens was engaged with "<a href="David%20Copperfield">David Copperfield</a>" and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book. He decided the best way to reach his audience with his "Carol philosophy" was by public readings. During Christmas 1852 Dickens gave a reading in <a href="Birmingham%20Town%20Hall">Birmingham Town Hall</a> to the Industrial and Literary Institute; the performance was a great success. Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance.
In the years following the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone ("Christmas Shadows", 1850), <a href="Horatio%20Alger">Horatio Alger</a> ("Job Warner's Christmas", 1863), <a href="Louisa%20May%20Alcott">Louisa May Alcott</a> ("A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True", 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man – or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.

The novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, one by Edward Stirling being sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights. By the close of February 1844 eight rival "A Christmas Carol" theatrical productions were playing in London. The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens's other works. In 1901 it was produced as "<a href="Scrooge%2C%20or%2C%20Marley%27s%20Ghost">Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost</a>", a <a href="Silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="Black-and-white%20film">black-and-white</a> British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, but it is now largely <a href="Lost%20film">lost</a>. The story was adapted in 1923 for <a href="BBC%20radio">BBC radio</a>. The story has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, a <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical, animation, and a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> mime production starring <a href="Marcel%20Marceau">Marcel Marceau</a>.

Davis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original. Some of Dickens's scenes—such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers—have been forgotten by many, while other events often added—such as Scrooge visiting the Cratchits on Christmas Day—are now thought by many to be part of the original story. Accordingly, Davis distinguishes between the original text and the "remembered version".

The phrase "<a href="Christmas%20and%20holiday%20season%23History%20of%20the%20phrase">Merry Christmas</a>" had been around for many years – the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 – but Dickens's use of the phrase in "A Christmas Carol" popularised it among the Victorian public. The exclamation "<a href="Humbug">Bah! Humbug!</a>" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive; the name "Scrooge" became used as a designation for a miser, and was added to the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" as such in 1982.
In the early 19th century the celebration of Christmas was associated in Britain with the countryside and peasant revels, disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place. Davis considers that in "A Christmas Carol", Dickens showed that Christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities, despite increasing modernisation. The modern observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday. The <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a> of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with <a href="Christmastide">Christmastide</a> and, with "A Christmas Carol", Dickens captured the <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.

Dickens advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday, which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit. The historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> writes that Dickens "linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation".

The novelist <a href="William%20Dean%20Howells">William Dean Howells</a>, analysing several of Dickens's Christmas stories, including "A Christmas Carol", considered that by 1891 the "pathos appears false and strained; the humor largely horseplay; the characters theatrical; the joviality pumped; the psychology commonplace; the sociology alone funny". The writer <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a> considered that Dickens took a childish approach with "A Christmas Carol", to produce a gap between the naïve optimism of the story, and the realities of life at the time.

Ruth Glancy, a professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of "A Christmas Carol" was the influence felt by individual readers. In early 1844 "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella; in 1874, <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need; and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book. In 1867 one American businessman was so moved by attending a reading, that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey, while in the early years of the 20th century <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Maud of Wales</a> – the <a href="Queen%20of%20Norway">Queen of Norway</a> – sent gifts to London's crippled children signed "With Tiny Tim's Love". On the novella, the author <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> wrote "The beauty and blessing of the story ... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him. ... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us."

Davis, analysing the changes made to adaptations over time, sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period. While Dickens's Victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as a spiritual but secular parable, in the early 20th century it became a children's story, read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger. In the lead up to, and during, the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Davis identifies that while some see the story as a "denunciation of capitalism, ...most read it as a way to escape oppressive economic realities". The film versions of the 1930s were different in the UK and US. British-made films showed a traditional telling of the story, while US-made works showed Cratchit in a more central role, escaping the depression caused by European bankers and celebrating what Davis calls "the Christmas of the common man". In the 1960s, Scrooge was sometimes portrayed as a Freudian figure wrestling with his past. By the 1980s he was again set in a world of depression and economic uncertainty.

Gertie the Dinosaur

Gertie the Dinosaur is a 1914 <a href="animation">animated</a> <a href="short%20film">short film</a> by American cartoonist and animator <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. It is the earliest animated film to feature a <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>. McCay first used the film before live audiences as an interactive part of his <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act; the frisky, childlike Gertie did tricks at the command of her master. McCay's employer <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> curtailed McCay's vaudeville activities, so McCay added a live-action introductory sequence to the film for its theatrical release. McCay abandoned a sequel, "Gertie on Tour" (), after producing about a minute of footage.

Although "Gertie" is popularly thought to be the earliest animated film, McCay had earlier made "<a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">Little Nemo</a>" (1911) and "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" (1912). The American <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a> and the French <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a> had experimented with animation even earlier; Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier "trick films". "Gertie" was the first film to use animation techniques such as <a href="key%20frame">keyframes</a>, <a href="Printing%20registration">registration marks</a>, tracing paper, the <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a> action viewer, and <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animation%20loops">animation loops</a>. It influenced the next generation of animators such as the <a href="Fleischer%20Studios">Fleischer brothers</a>, <a href="Otto%20Messmer">Otto Messmer</a>, <a href="Paul%20Terry%20%28cartoonist%29">Paul Terry</a>, and <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>. <a href="John%20Randolph%20Bray">John Randolph Bray</a> unsuccessfully tried to patent many of McCay's animation techniques and is said to have been behind a plagiarized version of "Gertie" that appeared a year or two after the original. "Gertie" is the best preserved of McCay's films—some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments—and has been preserved in the U.S. <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>' <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 1991.

<a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a> ( – 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist by the time he started making newspaper comic strips such as "<a href="Dream%20of%20the%20Rarebit%20Fiend">Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</a>" (1904–11) and his signature strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo</a>" (1905–14). In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing <a href="chalk%20talk">chalk talk</a>s—performances in which he drew before live audiences.

Inspired by the <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>s his son brought home, McCay "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures" of his cartoons. He claimed that he "was the first man in the world to make animated cartoons", though he was preceded by the American <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">James Stuart Blackton</a> and the French <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a>. McCay's <a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">first film</a> starred his "Little Nemo" characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911; he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act. He followed it in 1912 with "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>", in which a giant, naturalistically animated mosquito sucks the blood of a sleeping man. McCay gave the mosquito a personality and balanced humor with the horror of the nightmare situation. His animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced the characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires; to show that he had not, McCay chose a creature that could not have been photographed for his next film.

McCay conferred with the <a href="American%20Historical%20Association">American Historical Society</a> in 1912, and announced plans for "the presentation of pictures showing the great monsters that used to inhabit the earth". He spoke of the "serious and educational work" that the animation process could enable. McCay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work, such as a March 4, 1905, episode of "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" in which a "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>" skeleton took part in a horse race, and a May 25, 1913, "Rarebit Fiend" episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur; the layout of the background to the latter bore a strong resemblance to what later appeared in "Gertie". In the September 21, 1913, episode of McCay's "Little Nemo" strip "In the Land of Wonderful Dreams", titled "In the Land of the Antediluvians", Nemo meets a blue dinosaur named Bessie which has the same design as that of Gertie.

McCay considered a number of names before settling on "Gertie"; his production notebooks used "Jessie the ". Disney animator <a href="Paul%20Satterfield%20%28animator%29">Paul Satterfield</a> recalled hearing McCay in 1915 relate how he had chosen the name "Gertie":

"Gertie the Dinosaur" is the earliest animated film to feature a dinosaur. Its star Gertie does tricks much like a trained elephant. She is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for the time; she breathes rhythmically, she shifts her weight as she moves, and her abdominal muscles undulate as she draws water. McCay imbued her with a personality—while friendly, she could be capricious, ignoring or rebelling against her master's commands.

When her master McCay calls her, the frisky, childlike Gertie appears from a cave. Her whip-wielding master has her do tricks such as raising her foot or bowing on command. When she feels she has been pushed too far, she nips back at her master. She cries when he scolds her, and he placates her with a pumpkin. Throughout the act, prehistoric denizens such as a flying lizard continually distract Gertie. She tosses a mammoth in the lake; when it teases her by spraying her with water, she hurls a boulder at it as it swims away. After she quenches her thirst by draining the lake, McCay has her carry him offstage while he bows to the audience.

"Gertie" was McCay's first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds. Main production began in mid-1913. Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on sheets of <a href="rice%20paper">rice paper</a>, a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink, and as it was translucent it was ideal for the laborious retracing of backgrounds, a job that fell to art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons. The drawings themselves occupied a area of the paper, marked with registration marks in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed. They were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard.

McCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion; he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gertie's breathing, and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gertie's great weight. McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie's movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in a scene in which Gertie stood up, McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers' attention. When the drawings were finished, they were photographed at <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> in early 1914.

McCay pioneered the "McCay Split System" of animation, in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after. This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film's actions. McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, "Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club." During production of "Gertie", he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator <a href="John%20Randolph%20Bray">John Randolph Bray</a>, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of <a href="Printing%20registration">registration marks</a>, tracing paper, and the <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a> action viewer, and the <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animation%20loops">cycling of drawings</a> to create repetitive action. The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he received <a href="Royalties">royalty payments</a> from Bray for licensing the techniques.

"Gertie the Dinosaur" first appeared as part of McCay's vaudeville act in early 1914. It appeared in movie theaters in an edition with a live-action prologue, distributed by <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a>'s <a href="Box%20Office%20Attractions%20Company">Box Office Attractions Company</a> from December 28. Dinosaurs were still new to the public imagination at the time of Gertie's release—a "<a href="Apatosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>" skeleton was put on public display for the first time in 1905. Advertisements reflected this by trying to educate audiences: "According to science this monster once ruled this planet  ... Skeletons now being unearthed measuring from 90 ft. to 160 ft. in length. An elephant should be a mouse beside Gertie."

McCay originally used a version of the film as part of his vaudeville act. The first performance was on February 8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with "How a Mosquito Operates". He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. Standing to the right of the film screen, he introduced "the only dinosaur in captivity". As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he "reappeared" in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.

The show soon moved to New York. Though reviews were positive, McCay's employer at the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York American</a>", newspaper magnate <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, was displeased that his star cartoonist's vaudeville schedule interrupted his work illustrating editorials. At Hearst's orders, reviews of McCay's shows disappeared from the "American"s pages. Shortly after, Hearst refused to run paid advertisements from the Victoria Theater, where McCay performed in New York. On March 8, Hearst announced a ban on artists in his employ from performing in vaudeville. McCay's contract did not prohibit him from his vaudeville performances, but Hearst was able to pressure McCay and his agents to cancel bookings, and eventually McCay signed a new contract barring him from performing outside of <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">greater New York</a>.

In November 1914, film producer <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a> offered to market "Gertie the Dinosaur" to moving-picture theaters for "spot cash and highest prices". McCay accepted, and extended the film to include a live-action prologue and <a href="intertitle">intertitle</a>s to replace his stage patter. The film successfully traveled the country and had reached the west coast by December.

The live-action sequence was likely shot on November 19, 1914. It features McCay with several of his friends, such as cartoonists <a href="George%20McManus">George McManus</a> and <a href="Tad%20Dorgan">Tad Dorgan</a>, writer <a href="Roy%20McCardell">Roy McCardell</a>, and actor <a href="Tom%20Powers">Tom Powers</a>; McCay's son <a href="Bob%20McCay">Robert</a> had a cameo as a camera-room assistant. McCay used a bet as a plot device, as he had previously in the "Little Nemo" film.

As the film opens, McCay and friends suffer a flat tire in front of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. They enter the museum, and while viewing a "Brontosaurus" skeleton, McCay wagers a dinner that he can bring a dinosaur to life with his animation skills. The animation process and its "10,000 drawings, each a little different from the one preceding it" is put on display, with humorous scenes of mountains of paper, some of which an assistant drops. When the film is finished, the friends gather to view it in a restaurant.

Using extant original drawings by McCay, <a href="David%20L.%20Nathan">David L. Nathan</a> reconstructed the lost "Encore" sequence from McCay's original vaudeville version. He initiated a restoration of the entire film and, with animation historian Donald Crafton, proposed a reconstruction of McCay's vaudeville performance. Crafton, Nathan and Marco de Blois of the <a href="Cin%C3%A9math%C3%A8que%20qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9coise">Cinémathèque québécoise</a> worked with a team of professionals from the <a href="National%20Film%20Board%20of%20Canada">National Film Board of Canada</a> to complete the project, which premiered live during the closing ceremony of the 2018 <a href="Annecy%20International%20Animated%20Film%20Festival">Annecy Film Festival</a> in France.

McCay's working method was laborious, and animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films. Within a few years of "Nemo"s release, Canadian <a href="Raoul%20Barr%C3%A9">Raoul Barré</a>'s registration pegs combined with American <a href="Earl%20Hurd">Earl Hurd</a>'s <a href="cel">cel</a> technology became near-universal methods in animation studios. McCay used cel technology in his follow-up to "Gertie", "<a href="The%20Sinking%20of%20the%20Lusitania">The Sinking of the Lusitania</a>" (1918). It was his most ambitious film at 25,000 drawings, and took nearly two years to complete, but was not a commercial success.

McCay made six more films, though three of them were never made commercially available. After 1921, McCay was made to give up animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations. Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with "Jungle Imps" author <a href="George%20Randolph%20Chester">George Randolph Chester</a>, a musical film called "The Barnyard Band", and a film about the Americans' role in World War I.

In 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York. After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator <a href="Max%20Fleischer">Max Fleischer</a>. McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated them, saying, "Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. "Bad Luck!"" That September he appeared on the radio at <a href="WRKO">WNAC</a>, and on November 2 <a href="Frank%20Craven">Frank Craven</a> interviewed him for "<a href="The%20News%20Journal">The Evening Journal</a>"s "Woman's Hour". During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation. McCay died July 26, 1934, of a <a href="embolism">cerebral embolism</a>.

"Gertie" pleased audiences and reviewers. It won the praise of drama critic <a href="Ashton%20Stevens">Ashton Stevens</a> in Chicago, where the act opened. On February 22, 1914, before Hearst had barred the "New York American" from mentioning McCay's vaudeville work, a columnist in the paper called the act "a laugh from start to finish  ... far funnier than his noted mosquito drawings". On February 28 the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Evening Journal</a>" called it "the greatest act in the history of motion picture cartoonists". Émile Cohl praised McCay's "admirably drawn" films, and "Gertie" in particular, after seeing them in New York before he returned to Europe. Upon its theatrical release, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine wrote the film had "plenty of comedy throughout" and that it would "always be remarked upon as exceptionally clever".

A fake version of "Gertie the Dinosaur" appeared a year or two after the original; it features a dinosaur performing most of Gertie's tricks, but with less skillful animation, using cels on a static background. It is not known for certain who produced the film, though its style is believed to be that of <a href="Bray%20Productions">Bray Productions</a>. Filmmaker <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> rode the back of a <a href="Clay%20animation">clay-animated</a> dinosaur in homage to "Gertie" in "<a href="Three%20Ages">Three Ages</a>" (1923).

McCay's first three films were the earliest animated works to have a commercial impact; their success motivated film studios to join in the infant animation industry. Other studios used McCay's combination of live action with animation, such as the <a href="Fleischer%20Studios">Fleischer Studios</a> series "<a href="Out%20of%20the%20Inkwell">Out of the Inkwell</a>" (1918–1929) and <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s "<a href="Alice%20Comedies">Alice Comedies</a>" series (1923–1927). McCay's clean-line, high-contrast, realistic style set the pattern for American animation to come, and set it apart from the abstract, open forms of animation in Europe. This legacy is most apparent in the feature films of the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Walt Disney Animation Studios</a>, for example in "<a href="Fantasia%20%281940%20film%29">Fantasia</a>" (1940), which included <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style, with careful attention to timing and weight. <a href="Shamus%20Culhane">Shamus Culhane</a>, <a href="Dave%20Fleischer">Dave</a> and Max Fleischer, <a href="Walter%20Lantz">Walter Lantz</a>, <a href="Otto%20Messmer">Otto Messmer</a>, <a href="Pat%20Sullivan%20%28film%20producer%29">Pat Sullivan</a>, <a href="Paul%20Terry%20%28cartoonist%29">Paul Terry</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Tytla">Bill Tytla</a> were among the generation of American animators who drew inspiration from the films they saw in McCay's vaudeville act. "Gertie"s reputation was such that animation histories long named it as the first animated film.

Around 1921, McCay worked on a second animated film featuring Gertie, titled "Gertie on Tour". The film was to have Gertie bouncing on the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> in New York, attempting to eat the <a href="Washington%20Monument">Washington Monument</a> in Washington, D.C., wading in on the <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a> shore, and other scenes. The film exists only in concept sketches and in one minute of film footage in which Gertie plays with a trolley and dances before other dinosaurs.

Since his death, McCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved; much was destroyed in a late-1930s house fire, and more was sold off when the McCays needed money. About 400 original drawings from the film have been preserved, discovered by animator Robert Brotherton in disarray in the fabric shop of Irving Mendelsohn, into whose care McCay's films and artwork had been entrusted in the 1940s. Besides some cels from "The Sinking of the Lusitania", these "Gertie" drawings are the only original animation artwork of McCay's to have survived. McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm <a href="Nitrocellulose%23Nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, which deteriorates and is highly flammable in storage. A pair of young animators discovered the film in 1947 and preserved what they could. In many cases only fragments could be saved, if anything at all. Of all of McCay's films, "Gertie" is the best preserved. Mendelsohn and Brotherton tried fruitlessly to find an institution to store McCay's films until the Canadian film conservatory the <a href="Cin%C3%A9math%C3%A8que%20qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9coise">Cinémathèque québécoise</a> approached them in 1967 on the occasion of that year's World Animation Film Exposition in Montreal. The Cinémathèque québécoise has since curated McCay's films. Of the surviving drawings, fifteen have been determined not to appear in extant copies of the film. They appear to come from a single sequence, likely at the close of the film, and have Gertie showing her head from the audience's right and giving a bow.

McCay's son Robert unsuccessfully attempted to revive Gertie with a comic strip called "Dino". He and Disney animator Richard Huemer recreated the original vaudeville performance for the "<a href="Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series">Disneyland</a>" television program in 1955; this was the first exposure the film had for that generation. Walt Disney expressed to the younger McCay his feeling of debt, and gestured to the Disney studios saying, "Bob, all this should be your father's." An ice cream shop in the shape of Gertie sits by Echo Lake in <a href="Disney%27s%20Hollywood%20Studios">Disney's Hollywood Studios</a> in <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a>.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" film critic <a href="Richard%20Eder">Richard Eder</a>, on seeing a retrospective of McCay's animation at the <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> in 1975, wrote of "Gertie" that "Disney  ... struggled mightily to recapture" the qualities in McCay's animation, but that "Disney's magic, though sometimes scary, was always contained; McCay's approached necromancy". Eder compared McCay's artistic vision to that of poet <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, saying "it was too strange and personal to be generalized or to have any children".

"Gertie" has been written about in hundreds of books and articles. Animation historian Donald Crafton called "Gertie" "the enduring masterpiece of pre-Disney animation". Brothers Simon and <a href="Kim%20Deitch">Kim Deitch</a> loosely based their graphic novel "<a href="The%20Boulevard%20of%20Broken%20Dreams%20%28comics%29">The Boulevard of Broken Dreams</a>" (2002) on McCay's disillusionment with the animation industry in the 1920s. The story features an aged cartoonist named Winsor Newton, who in his younger years had a "Gertie"-like stage act featuring a <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> named Milton. "Gertie" has been selected for preservation in the US <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>.

Greed (film)

Greed is a 1924 American <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>, written and directed by <a href="Erich%20von%20Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a> and based on the 1899 <a href="Frank%20Norris">Frank Norris</a> novel "<a href="McTeague">McTeague</a>". It stars <a href="Gibson%20Gowland">Gibson Gowland</a> as Dr. John McTeague, <a href="ZaSu%20Pitts">ZaSu Pitts</a> as Trina Sieppe, his wife, and <a href="Jean%20Hersholt">Jean Hersholt</a> as McTeague's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina. Shortly after their engagement, Trina wins a lottery prize of $5,000, at that time a substantial sum. Schouler jealously informs the authorities that McTeague had been practicing dentistry without a license, and McTeague and Trina become impoverished. While living in squalor, McTeague becomes a violent alcoholic and Trina becomes greedily obsessed with her winnings, refusing to spend any of them, despite how poor she and her husband have become. Eventually McTeague murders Trina for the money and flees to <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>. Schouler catches up with him there for a final confrontation.

"Greed" was one of the few films of its time to be shot entirely on location, with Stroheim shooting approximately 85 hours of footage before editing. Two months alone were spent shooting in Death Valley for the film's final sequence, and many of the cast and crew became ill. Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as <a href="deep-focus">deep-focus</a> cinematography and <a href="Soviet%20montage%20theory">montage editing</a>. He considered "Greed" to be a <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a>, in which environment and heredity controlled the characters' fates and reduced them to primitive "bêtes humaines" (human beasts).

During editing on "Greed", the production company merged into <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, putting <a href="Irving%20Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> in charge of the film's post-production. Thalberg had fired Stroheim a few years earlier at <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. Originally almost eight hours long, "Greed" was edited against Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now <a href="List%20of%20incomplete%20or%20partially%20lost%20films">lost</a>; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Stroheim later called "Greed" his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.

The uncut version has been called the "holy grail" for film archivists, amid repeated false claims of the discovery of the missing footage. In 1999 <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> created a four-hour version of "Greed" that used existing stills of cut scenes to reconstruct the film. "Greed" was a critical and financial failure upon its initial release, but by the 1950s it began to be regarded as one of the <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">greatest films ever made</a>; filmmakers and scholars have noted its influence on subsequent films.

John McTeague is a miner working in <a href="Placer%20County%2C%20California">Placer County, California</a>. A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. "Painless" Potter visits the town, and McTeague's mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on <a href="Polk%20Street">Polk Street</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>.

Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fiancée, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As they wait for an opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.

Schouler leaves the city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).

Trina's bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.

Now an outlaw, McTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.

The oppressive heat slows McTeague's progress. Schouler's progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.

Von Stroheim's original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted the lives of the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>.

The second sub-plot depicts the lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.



"Greed" is based on the American author <a href="Frank%20Norris">Frank Norris</a>'s 1899 novel "<a href="McTeague">McTeague: A Story of San Francisco</a>". Stroheim's interest in "McTeague" can be traced back to January 1920, when he told a journalist that he wanted to film the novel. He had himself lived in San Francisco in the early 1910s, living there in poverty like that of the story's characters. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, and worked his way up in the film industry from extra to acting in villainous or aristocratic roles in films By 1919, Stroheim had finally become a successful director in his own right at <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Film Manufacturing Company</a>, although one with a reputation of going over budget and over schedule.

Upon the appointment of <a href="Irving%20Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> as general manager at Universal, Stroheim's defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of "<a href="Foolish%20Wives">Foolish Wives</a>" in 1921 (which had been shooting nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on "<a href="Merry-Go-Round%20%281923%20film%29">Merry-Go-Round</a>", Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding a new era in which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. However, by this time Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the <a href="Goldwyn%20Pictures">Goldwyn Company</a> on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.

Stroheim chose his new studio because of the level of artistic freedom he was offered, which he had been denied at Universal under Thalberg. Since March of that year, Goldwyn had been run by <a href="Abe%20Lehr">Abe Lehr</a>, who publicly promised that "each director will have his own staff and will be given every facility in putting into production his own individuality and personality." Stroheim signed a one-year, three-feature deal with Goldwyn on November 20, 1922. The deal stipulated that each feature would be between long, cost no more than $175,000 and be completed in fourteen weeks. It also promised von Stroheim $30,000 for each completed film.

Lehr initially hired Stroheim in order to film a big-budget version of the <a href="operetta">operetta</a> "<a href="The%20Merry%20Widow">The Merry Widow</a>", which the producer saw as a guaranteed hit; Stroheim, however, convinced Lehr to let him make "Greed" first, promising low costs. A press release of February 1923 said that although Stroheim had "run rather freely to large sets in the past, [he] seems to have reformed—or surrendered—for it is announced that he will not build any sets at all."

Stroheim wrote a highly detailed 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and <a href="Film%20tinting">tint</a> cues. Among the changes that he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris's <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>. "McTeague" had been filmed once before as "<a href="McTeague%20%28film%29">Life's Whirlpool</a>", a five-reel short by <a href="William%20A.%20Brady">William A. Brady</a>'s World Pictures, starring Broadway star <a href="Holbrook%20Blinn">Holbrook Blinn</a> as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance. According to film historian <a href="Kevin%20Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a>, "Life's Whirlpool" was also shot on location in Death Valley.

Stroheim was known for his meticulous perfectionism and attention to detail, as well as his insolence towards studio executives. Working on "Greed", Stroheim set out to make a realistic film about everyday people and rejected the Hollywood tropes of glamor, happy endings and upper-class characters. Before shooting began, Stroheim told a reporter:

In early January 1923 Stroheim arrived in San Francisco, where he scouted locations and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for "Greed", he attended society functions in town and met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother <a href="Charles%20Gilman%20Norris">Charles</a> and his sister-in-law <a href="Kathleen%20Norris">Kathleen</a>. To capture the authentic spirit of the story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in <a href="Iowa%20Hill%2C%20California">Iowa Hill</a>, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included <a href="Cliff%20House%2C%20San%20Francisco">Cliff House</a> and San Francisco Bay.

Norris had similarly scouted settings for his novel and chose the upstairs of a building on the corner of Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.

Despite the strict conditions of Stroheim's initial contract, Goldwyn approved the lengthy shooting script before filming began. Production Manager J. J. Cohn later explained that "they thought they could control him when the time comes."

With the exception of <a href="Jean%20Hersholt">Jean Hersholt</a>, all of the main actors in "Greed" were regulars of Stroheim's earlier films, a group dubbed the "Stroheim Stock Company". <a href="Gibson%20Gowland">Gibson Gowland</a> had previously appeared in "<a href="Blind%20Husbands">Blind Husbands</a>" and returned to the U.S. from Scotland for the role of John McTeague. <a href="Cesare%20Gravina">Cesare Gravina</a>, who played the junkman Zerkow, and <a href="Dale%20Fuller%20%28actor%29">Dale Fuller</a>, the lottery-ticket seller Maria, had both appeared in "Foolish Wives" and would later appear in "The Merry Widow". Other actors in Stroheim's Stock Company included <a href="Sidney%20Bracey">Sidney Bracey</a>, <a href="Mae%20Busch">Mae Busch</a>, <a href="George%20Fawcett">George Fawcett</a>, <a href="Maude%20George">Maude George</a>, <a href="Hughie%20Mack">Hughie Mack</a> and <a href="George%20Nichols%20%28actor%29">George Nichols</a>.

Trina was the most difficult role to cast, and <a href="ZaSu%20Pitts">ZaSu Pitts</a> was hired at the last minute, after Stroheim had rejected both <a href="Claire%20Windsor">Claire Windsor</a> and <a href="Colleen%20Moore">Colleen Moore</a>. Pitts had previously acted only in comedic roles; "Greed" was her first dramatic part. The actress later appeared in both "<a href="The%20Wedding%20March%20%281928%20film%29">The Wedding March</a>" and "<a href="Hello%2C%20Sister%21">Hello, Sister!</a>" Stroheim said that Pitts was "the greatest psychopathological actress in the American cinema" and that "she should not be in comedy, for she is the greatest of all tragediennes."

Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt to discuss the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was initially reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, Stroheim changed his mind on the spot. With the exception of Gowland, Stroheim shot extensive <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>s of all the other actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer <a href="Paul%20Ivano">Paul Ivano</a>. A scene from the Goldwyn film "<a href="Souls%20for%20Sale">Souls for Sale</a>" is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of Stroheim directing "Greed", but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.

Filming began in San Francisco on March 13, 1923, and lasted until late June. Despite the initial contract between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed to double the film's budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began. Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set after a few days of filming. He remained in good health for the remainder of the shoot. This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina got double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly ashamed that Gravina's entire performance was later cut from the film, despite the actor's dedication to the role. Hersholt was knocked out by Gowland during the picnic scene (later cut) in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was almost run over by a trolley. In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that "it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio."

One scene that von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence depicted a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is too embarrassed to examine the teeth of a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A <a href="special-effect">special-effect</a> shot was used instead.

After filming in San Francisco wrapped in late June, the production traveled to <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>. Most Hollywood films that required desert scenes settled for the local <a href="Oxnard">Oxnard</a> dunes north of Los Angeles, but von Stroheim insisted on authenticity. Death Valley had no roads, hotels, gas stations, or running water and was occupied by tarantulas, scorpions and venomous snakes. The nearest populated area to the shoot was away and insurance coverage was denied. Filming in Death Valley lasted for two months during midsummer, allowing actors Gowland and Hersholt time to grow the beards necessary for the sequence. Some members of the production reported temperatures between , but the highest temperature officially recorded in Death Valley during the period was . Of the 43 members of the cast and crew who worked on the Death Valley sequence, 14 became ill and were sent back to Los Angeles.

While shooting, crew members would collapse of heat exhaustion every day. Hersholt spent a week in the hospital after shooting was completed, suffering from internal bleeding. Hersholt claimed to have lost , and was covered in blisters by the end of filming. Despite the hardship Hersholt said that he considered it the best role of his career. In order to motivate Hersholt and Gibson during the scene where they fight, von Stroheim yelled at them, "Fight, fight! Try to hate each other as you both hate me!" Throughout filming, von Stroheim brought musicians on set to help create mood for the actors. He continued to use this for the Death Valley scenes with a <a href="harmonium">harmonium</a> and <a href="violin">violin</a> player. A theme, inspired by the music of <a href="Ruggero%20Leoncavallo">Ruggero Leoncavallo</a>, was composed and played throughout production. Other music used included the popular songs "<a href="Nearer%2C%20My%20God%2C%20to%20Thee">Nearer, My God, to Thee</a>", "<a href="Hearts%20and%20Flowers">Hearts and Flowers</a>", "<a href="Oh%20Promise%20Me">Oh Promise Me</a>", and "Call Me Thine Own".

Filming moved to Placer County, California, on September 13 and continued for less than a month. The Big Dipper Mine had been closed for ten years, so von Stroheim convinced the Goldwyn Company to lease and renovate it for filming. While first visiting Placer County during pre-production, von Stroheim had met Harold Henderson, a local resident and fan of Norris whose brother had worked in the mine in the 1890s. Von Stroheim hired Henderson to oversee the renovation of the mine and other locations in Iowa Hill. Von Stroheim also wanted to restore the local cemetery for a newly invented scene depicting McTeague's mother's funeral, but the Goldwyn Company turned down this proposal. Inside the mine, von Stroheim usually shot at night between 9 pm and 6 am. Cinematographer <a href="William%20H.%20Daniels">William H. Daniels</a> later said that von Stroheim insisted on descending underground for realism, even though the setting would have looked exactly the same at . Filming was completed on October 6, 1923, after 198 days. Despite his original contract stipulating that all films be under , von Stroheim shot a total of of footage for the film, running approximately 85 hours.

Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig compared the director's visual style to that of pioneering filmmaker <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a>, but felt that "unlike Griffith, who viewed scenes as though through a fourth wall, Stroheim shot from many sides and from different angles; he also used deep-focus, meaningful foregrounds and effective camera movement." "Greed"s lighting included high contrast, <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> techniques with pools or shafts of lights illuminating an otherwise dark space. Examples of this technique include the scene where McTeague begs Trina for money in a pool of moonlight and the merry-go-round scene in which characters alternate between appearing only as dark silhouettes and being fully lit.

Daniels was especially proud of the wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible through the window and was difficult to light properly. "Greed" has often been praised for its use of <a href="deep-focus">deep-focus</a> cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>". Daniels sometimes used <a href="incandescent%20light">incandescent light</a>s instead of studio <a href="Arc%20lamp">arc lights</a>, due to the constraints of his locations. He later said that Stroheim "was one of the first to insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes  ... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown" to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints. Although not officially credited, <a href="Ernest%20B.%20Schoedsack">Ernest B. Schoedsack</a> worked on the picture as a camera operator.

Stroheim favored <a href="Soviet%20montage%20theory">"Soviet-style" montage editing</a>. "Greed" often uses dramatic close-ups and cuts instead of long takes. One exception to this is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." In the 1950s film critic <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Bazin">André Bazin</a> praised Stroheim's use of "<a href="mise%20en%20sc%C3%A8ne">mise en scène</a>" and noted his "one simple rule for directing. Take a close look at the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness."

Despite Stroheim's reputation as a perfectionist, "Greed" contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim did his best to avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era "Greed" was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.

Frank Norris's novel belongs to the literary school of <a href="Naturalism%20%28literature%29">naturalism</a> founded by French author <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a>. "McTeague" depicts the fate of its lower-class characters in terms of heredity and their environment, with the belief that "man's nature, despite free will, is determined by genetic and environmental factors" and that heredity controls fate, despite efforts at upward mobility. This literary style was influenced by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and portrayed characters whose higher states of being, the rational and compassionate, are in conflict with their lower states, the "bête humaine" (human beast). "McTeague" was first published in 1899 and was inspired by an October 1893 murder case in which Patrick Collins, a poor husband with a history of beating his wife Sarah, finally stole her money and stabbed her to death at her San Francisco workplace. Sarah Collins worked at the Lest Norris kindergarten, which was financed by Norris's family.

Von Stroheim did not see "Greed" as political and told a journalist that he considered it to be like a <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a>. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.

One of the cinematic techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In "Greed" McTeague is associated with a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual "<a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>". For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.

Throughout his career von Stroheim used grotesque imagery and characters. This is most apparent in the wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity and a sense of communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.

As in his other films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on <a href="Easter%20Sunday">Easter Sunday</a> and is murdered by McTeague on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>. Christmas Eve was often depicted in von Stroheim's films and was close to the date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom "Greed" is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.

Editing "Greed" took almost a year and von Stroheim's contract did not include payment for his post-production work. He and his chief film cutter Frank Hull worked on the film for several months before completing a rough cut. Von Stroheim was indecisive during editing. He felt restricted by his contract's limitation on the length of the film. Von Stroheim colored certain scenes with gold tinting by using the <a href="Handschiegl%20Color%20Process">Handschiegl Color Process</a>, in which individual frames are hand colored with stencils. Von Stroheim credited himself in the beginning titles with "Personally directed by Erich von Stroheim."

Other than studio personnel, only twelve people saw the original 42-reel version of "Greed" at a special screening in January 1924; they included <a href="Harry%20Carr">Harry Carr</a>, <a href="Rex%20Ingram%20%28director%29">Rex Ingram</a>, <a href="Aileen%20Pringle">Aileen Pringle</a>, <a href="Carmel%20Myers">Carmel Myers</a>, <a href="Idwal%20Jones%20%28academic%29">Idwal Jones</a>, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and <a href="Jean%20Bertin">Jean Bertin</a>. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made and that it was unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see  ... I can't imagine what they are going to do with it. It is like "<a href="Les%20Miserables">Les Miserables</a>". Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of <a href="Jacques%20Rivette">Jacques Rivette</a>'s "<a href="Out%201">Out 1</a>". Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared "Greed" to "<a href="The%20Cabinet%20of%20Dr.%20Caligari">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>" and "<a href="Dr.%20Mabuse%20the%20Gambler">Dr. Mabuse the Gambler</a>". However, Welford Beaton of "The Film Spectator" disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.

Many sources claim that the 42-reel version was only ever intended to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, "I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture." Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream. While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who was the head of the Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of "Greed" by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281925%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>" and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.

After having completed the 24-reel cut of "Greed", von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives that he could not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on "<a href="The%20Devil%27s%20Pass%20Key">The Devil's Pass Key</a>" and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was "very distasteful". Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out of quick "flash" shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock's version of "Greed" retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.

Whytock and Ingram screened their version of "Greed" to studio executives, who responded favorably to it but worried that the tragic ending would be hard to sell to the public. Ingram then sent the 18-reel version to von Stroheim and told him, "If you cut one more frame I shall never speak to you again." On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim's nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of "Greed". Von Stroheim and <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> had a lengthy confrontation over the film's editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.

MGM executives screened "Greed" at full length once to meet contractual obligations. Idwal Jones, a San Francisco critic, attended the all-day screening and wrote that while some of the scenes were compelling, Stroheim's desire that "every comma of the book [be] put in" was ultimately negative. MGM then took control and re-edited it. The studio ordered June Mathis to cut it down further; she assigned the job to an editor named <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Farnham">Joseph W. Farnham</a>. Farnham was a well-known "titles editor", who patched scenes together using title cards to keep continuity. His contributions to "Greed" include the notorious title cards ""Such was McTeague"" and ""Let's go over and sit on the sewer"", which were snickered at for years. Eventually Farnham reduced "Greed" to 10 reels, totaling . Von Stroheim said that the film "was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat." He later bitterly lamented that "Greed" was made before the financial success of <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s four-hour play "<a href="Strange%20Interlude">Strange Interlude</a>" in 1928. Von Stroheim angrily disowned the final version, blaming Mathis for destroying his masterpiece.

One week before "Greed"s release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. These cuts included the administration of <a href="ether">ether</a> in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although these cuts were made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage was kept in many other prints.

The main cuts to "Greed" were the elimination of its two sub-plots and other entire sequences, while individual scenes were often not touched. Commenting about the cuts made in the film to the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", Thalberg stated:
Thalberg also stated that he "took no chances in cutting it. We took it around to different theaters in the suburbs, ran it at its enormous length, and then we took note of the places at which interest seemed to droop."

Individual scenes or sequences that were cut include McTeague and Trina's early, happy years of marriage, the sequence showing McTeague and Trina eventually moving into their shack, the family life of the Sieppe family before Trina's marriage, the prologue depicting McTeague's mother and father at the Big Dipper mine and McTeague's apprenticeship. Other cuts included the more suggestive and sexual close-up shots depicting McTeague and Trina's physical attraction to each other, the scenes after McTeague has murdered Trina and roams around San Francisco and Placer County, additional footage of Death Valley, additional footage of Trina with her money, and a more gradual version of Trina's descent into greed and miserly obsession.

"Greed" premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, which was owned by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign correspondent during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and Hearst praised "Greed", calling it the greatest film he had ever seen. Hearst's newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At the time of the release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on "The Merry Widow" on December 1. In May 1926 "Greed" was released in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling <a href="Nazi%20party">Nazi party</a>.

"Greed" received mostly negative reviews. The trade paper "Harrison's Report" said that "[i]f a contest were to be held to determine which has been the filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture in the history of the motion picture business, I am sure that "Greed" would win." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety Weekly</a>" called it "an out-and-out box office flop" only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" and that despite its "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story  ... it does not entertain." In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, "Exceptional Photoplays" called it "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." In the February 1925 issue of "Theatre Magazine", Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." <a href="Mordaunt%20Hall">Mordaunt Hall</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM "clipped this production as much as they dared  ... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." In a "<a href="Life%20Magazine">Life Magazine</a>" article, <a href="Robert%20E.%20Sherwood">Robert E. Sherwood</a> also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim "a genius  ... badly in need of a stopwatch." <a href="Iris%20Barry">Iris Barry</a> of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." A March 1925 review in "Pictureplay" magazine stated, "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice."

A more favorable review came from <a href="Richard%20Watts%2C%20Jr.">Richard Watts, Jr.</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>", who called "Greed" "the most important picture yet produced in America  ... It is the one picture of the season that can hold its own as a work of dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as "<a href="What%20Price%20Glory%3F%20%28play%29">What Price Glory?</a>" and "<a href="Desire%20Under%20the%20Elms">Desire Under the Elms</a>"." The April 20, 1925, edition of "<a href="The%20Montreal%20Gazette">The Montreal Gazette</a>" claimed it "impresses as a powerful film" and described the "capacity audience" screening as "one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration ... which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down to the level of the groundlings." The review went on to describe the direction as "masterly", citing "its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life's realities." A review in "Exceptional Photoplays" stated that "Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in "Greed" he has given us an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, "Greed" is a terrible and wonderful thing."

"Greed" was a financial disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $224,500 in the United States, $3,063 in Canada and $47,264 in other markets. In total it earned $274,827. Von Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig stated that according to MGM's records the final cost of "Greed" was $546,883. Another biographer, Richard Koszarski, stated that its final cost was $665,603: $585,250 for the production, $30,000 for von Stroheim's personal fee, $54,971 for processing and editing, $53,654 for advertising and $1,726 for Motion Picture dues.

Arthur Lennig asserted that MGM's official budget for "Greed" was suspiciously high for a film with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive "The Merry Widow" in order to prevent von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. "The Merry Widow" ended up being a hit and earned more profits than "Greed" had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.

In his final years, von Stroheim said that "of all my films, only "Greed" was a fully realized work, only "Greed" had a total validity." In 1926 a British foundation of arts and sciences requested a copy of the original version of "Greed" to keep in their archive, but their request was denied by MGM. <a href="Henri%20Langlois">Henri Langlois</a> screened the studio version of "Greed" for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, "It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone." He went on to say that "It was as if a man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue. Of course, he still loves her but it's only the memory of her that he can love—because he doesn't recognize her anymore."

In the early 1950s "Greed"s reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the "Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique", "Greed" was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as <a href="Luchino%20Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a>, <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> and <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a> voting for it. Later in 1952 "<a href="Sight%20and%20Sound">Sight and Sound</a>" magazine published its first list of the "ten greatest films ever made". "Greed" was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, <a href="Lotte%20Eisner">Lotte Eisner</a>, <a href="Curtis%20Harrington">Curtis Harrington</a>, <a href="Penelope%20Houston%20%28film%20critic%29">Penelope Houston</a> and <a href="Gavin%20Lambert">Gavin Lambert</a> voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The "<a href="Cinematek">Cinémathèque royale de Belgique</a>" released a list of "the most important and misappreciated American films of all time" in 1978. "Greed" was third on its list after "Citizen Kane" and "". In a <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> list of the "50 Most Significant American Films" made by the school's Performing Arts Council, "Greed" was listed as number 21. In 1991 "Greed" was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Among those who have praised "Greed" over the years are <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>; <a href="Joseph%20von%20Sternberg">Joseph von Sternberg</a>, who said, "We were all influenced by "Greed""; <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a>, who called it "the film of films"; and <a href="Ernst%20Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a>, who called von Stroheim "the only true 'novelist'" in films. More recently <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a> called it "a perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanization that was to come", and <a href="Norbert%20Pfaffenbichler">Norbert Pfaffenbichler</a> said that "the last shot of the movie is unforgettable." Jonathan Rosenbaum has stated that "Greed" was a major influence on the style and content of many films. Stroheim's shots filming the sun predated <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s better-known uses of the technique in "<a href="Rashomon">Rashomon</a>" (1950). Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in "Greed" to shots in <a href="King%20Vidor">King Vidor</a>'s "<a href="The%20Crowd%20%281928%20film%29">The Crowd</a>", Jean Renoir's "<a href="Le%20Crime%20de%20Monsieur%20Lange">Le Crime de Monsieur Lange</a>", Orson Welles's "<a href="The%20Magnificent%20Ambersons%20%28film%29">The Magnificent Ambersons</a>", <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>' "<a href="To%20Have%20and%20Have%20Not%20%28film%29">To Have and Have Not</a>" and <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>'s "<a href="L%27Avventura">L'Avventura</a>". In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in "Greed" to <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>'s "<a href="The%20Treasure%20of%20the%20Sierra%20Madre%20%28film%29">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>" (1948), <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s "<a href="Rear%20Window">Rear Window</a>" (1954), <a href="Claude%20Chabrol">Claude Chabrol</a>'s "<a href="Les%20Bonnes%20Femmes">Les Bonnes Femmes</a>" (1960) and <a href="Elaine%20May">Elaine May</a>'s "<a href="Mikey%20and%20Nicky">Mikey and Nicky</a>" (1975). Rosenbaum singled out Stroheim's influence on May, an American director, with "Mikey and Nicky" centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles' use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in "the spirit of von Stroheim".

The two films most commonly compared to "Greed" are Huston's "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons". Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being lost in the desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Greed" both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. "Ambersons" was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that "Greed" influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and <a href="Bill%20Forsyth">Bill Forsyth</a> followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to the intentions of the original novels. The 1994 <a href="Jonathan%20Lynn">Jonathan Lynn</a> film "<a href="Greedy%20%28film%29">Greedy</a>" pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.

Attempts to reconstruct the uncut version of "Greed" without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the "Cinémathèque royale de Belgique" named "Greed" as one of the twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for "Greed", which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order to reconstruct the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and <a href="Herman%20G.%20Weinberg">Herman G. Weinberg</a>, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to reconstruct the uncut version of "Greed", the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.

In 1999, <a href="Turner%20Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> (the film's current rights holder) decided to recreate, as closely as possible, the original version by combining the existing footage with over 650 still photographs of the lost scenes (many of which had been used in Weinberg's book), in accordance with an original continuity outline written by von Stroheim. All materials were provided by the <a href="Margaret%20Herrick%20Library">Margaret Herrick Library</a>. This restoration runs almost four hours. It was produced by <a href="film%20preservation">film preservation</a>ist <a href="Rick%20Schmidlin">Rick Schmidlin</a> and edited by Glenn Morgan. Schmidlin restored many characters and sub-plots from the original version. A new musical score was composed by Robert Israel. The reconstruction cost $100,000 to produce. Schmidlin called the finished product "a reconstruction of Von Stroheim's lost narrative." It premiered at the 1999 <a href="Telluride%20Film%20Festival">Telluride Film Festival</a> and was later screened at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> and the <a href="Pordenone%20Silent%20Film%20Festival">Pordenone Silent Film Festival</a> before being aired on <a href="Turner%20Classic%20Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> on December 5, 1999. Film critic <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> called the restored version of "Greed" a triumph. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called "Greed" a masterpiece and said that the restored Schmidlin cut illustrates the "prudish sensibilities [that] went into MGM's chop job." Rosenbaum praised the project, but claimed it could only be considered a "study version". The reconstruction won a special citation from the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Film%20Critics%20Association%20Awards%201999">Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards</a>.

Stroheim was known to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and military record in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, he had found a copy of "McTeague" in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. <a href="Georges%20Sadoul">Georges Sadoul</a> later stated that Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.

Claims that Stroheim's original cut was a completely unabridged version of "McTeague" are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was almost as long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original "Greed", this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.

"Greed" has sometimes been said to be over 100 reels long. Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several of the people who saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor <a href="Samuel%20Marx">Samuel Marx</a> erroneously claimed that the original version of "Greed" was 70 reels.

June Mathis is credited with co-writing the script due to her work on the 10-reel version. Mathis was the head of the Story Department at MGM and her contract stipulated that she would receive writing credit for all MGM films. She did not actually write any part of the screenplay. She is also said to have changed its title from "McTeague" to "Greed" during post-production; however, a publicity still of the cast and crew taken during production clearly indicates that it was titled "Greed" before the MGM merger even took place. The film's working title was ""Greedy Wives"", a joke on Stroheim's previous film "Foolish Wives"; this working title was never considered as the film's actual title.

The original version of "Greed" has been called the "holy grail" for film archivists. Various reports of the original version proved to be unfounded. Among these "sightings" are a claim that a copy existed in a vault in South America that was only screened once a year for invited guests on New Year's Eve. Another claim was that a copy in the possession of a Texan millionaire was sold to Henri Langlois of "<a href="Cin%C3%A9math%C3%A8que%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Cinémathèque Française</a>". Other claims include that a film society in Boston held a private screening of a print found by a World War II veteran in Berlin from a tip by <a href="Emil%20Jannings">Emil Jannings</a>, that <a href="David%20Shepard%20%28film%20preservationist%29">David Shepherd</a> of the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> had found a copy at a garage sale, and that the head of a film society in <a href="Redwood%20City%2C%20California">Redwood City, California</a>, owned "the longest existing version of "Greed" (purchased in Europe)." Stroheim himself once stated that <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> owned a personal copy of the film. Stroheim's son Joseph von Stroheim once claimed that when he was in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he saw a version of the film that took two nights to fully screen, although he could not remember exactly how long it was.

There were also reports that MGM had retained a copy of the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that <a href="John%20Houseman">John Houseman</a> had a private screening at MGM and that MGM owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine. Lotte Eisner once claimed that in the 1950s and 1960s, several cans of films labeled ""McTeague"" were found in MGM's vaults and destroyed by executives who did not know that it was footage from "Greed". MGM executive <a href="Albert%20Lewin">Al Lewin</a> said that several years after the film's release Stroheim asked him for the cut footage. Lewin and editor <a href="Margaret%20Booth">Margaret Booth</a> searched MGM's vault but could not find any missing footage.

Hockey Hall of Fame

The Hockey Hall of Fame () is an <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> museum located in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Dedicated to the <a href="history%20of%20ice%20hockey">history</a> of <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>, it is a <a href="museum">museum</a> and a <a href="hall%20of%20fame">hall of fame</a>. It holds exhibits about players, teams, <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) records, memorabilia and <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20awards">NHL trophies</a>, including the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>. Founded in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a>, the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership of <a href="James%20T.%20Sutherland">James T. Sutherland</a>. The first class of honoured members was inducted in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL withdrew its support for the <a href="International%20Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in Kingston, Ontario. Its first permanent building opened at <a href="Exhibition%20Place">Exhibition Place</a> in 1961. The hall was relocated in 1993, and is now in <a href="downtown%20Toronto">downtown Toronto</a>, inside <a href="Brookfield%20Place%20%28Toronto%29">Brookfield Place</a>, and a historic <a href="Bank%20of%20Montreal">Bank of Montreal</a> building.

An 18-person committee of players, coaches and others meets annually in June to select new honourees, who are inducted as players, <a href="List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23Builders">builders</a> or on-ice officials. In 2010, a subcategory was established for female players. The builders' category includes <a href="Coach%20%28ice%20hockey%29">coach</a>es, <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20General%20Managers">general manager</a>s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. Honoured members are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony held at the Hall of Fame building in November, which is followed by a special "Hockey Hall of Fame Game" between the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> and a visiting team. As of 2018, 280 players (including six women), 109 builders and 16 <a href="Official%20%28ice%20hockey%29">on-ice officials</a> have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been criticized for focusing mainly on players from the National Hockey League and largely ignoring players from other North American and international leagues.
The Hockey Hall of Fame was established through the efforts of <a href="James%20T.%20Sutherland">James T. Sutherland</a>, a former President of the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Canadian Amateur Hockey Association</a> (CAHA). Sutherland sought to establish it in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a> as he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey. In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston. Originally called the "International Hockey Hall of Fame", its mandate was to honour great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first nine "honoured members" (players <a href="Hobey%20Baker">Hobey Baker</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Gardiner%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Charlie Gardiner</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Gerard">Eddie Gerard</a>, <a href="Frank%20McGee%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Frank McGee</a>, <a href="Howie%20Morenz">Howie Morenz</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Phillips">Tommy Phillips</a>, <a href="Harvey%20Pulford">Harvey Pulford</a>, <a href="Hod%20Stuart">Hod Stuart</a> and <a href="Georges%20V%C3%A9zina">Georges Vézina</a>) were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the Hall of Fame still did not have a permanent home. The first board of governors consisted of <a href="Red%20Dutton">Red Dutton</a>, <a href="Art%20Ross">Art Ross</a>, Frank Sargent (president of the CHA), <a href="Lester%20Patrick">Lester Patrick</a>, Abbie E. H. Coo, Wes McKnight, Basil E. O'Meara, J. P. Fitzgerald and W. A. Hewitt.
Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a>, then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the hall in Kingston. In the same year, the NHL and the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Exhibition">Canadian National Exhibition</a> (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the <a href="Canadian%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Sports Hall of Fame</a> located at <a href="Exhibition%20Place">Exhibition Place</a>. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due to the success of the exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the <a href="Exhibition%20Place">Exhibition Place</a> was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960.
The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister <a href="John%20Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a>. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.

By 1986, the Hall of Fame was running out of room in its existing facilities and the Board of Directors decided that a new home was needed. The Hall vacated the Exhibition Place building in 1992, and its half was taken over by the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. (The building was eventually demolished; portion of its facade was preserved as an entrance to <a href="BMO%20Field">BMO Field</a> stadium. Development of the new location in the BCE Place complex (now <a href="Brookfield%20Place%20%28Toronto%29">Brookfield Place</a>), featuring the former <a href="Bank%20of%20Montreal">Bank of Montreal</a> at the corner of Yonge and Front Streets in Toronto, began soon after. The design was by <a href="Frank%20Darling%20%28architect%29">Frank Darling</a> and <a href="S.%20George%20Curry">S. George Curry</a>. The new Hockey Hall of Fame officially opened on June 18, 1993. The new location has of exhibition space, seven times larger than that of the old facility. The Hockey Hall of Fame now hosts more than 300,000 visitors each year.

The first curator of the new Hall of Fame was <a href="Bobby%20Hewitson">Bobby Hewitson</a>. Following Hewitson's retirement in 1967, <a href="Lefty%20Reid">Lefty Reid</a> was appointed to the position. Reid was curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame for the next 25 years, retiring in 1992. Following Reid's retirement, former NHL referee-in-chief <a href="Scotty%20Morrison">Scotty Morrison</a>, who was the president of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, was appointed curator. Morrison supervised the relocation of the Hall of Fame and its exhibits. The current curator is Phil Pritchard.

The Hockey Hall of Fame is led by <a href="Lanny%20McDonald">Lanny McDonald</a>, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Denommé. It is operated as a non-profit business called the "Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum" (HHFM), independent of the National Hockey League. The Hall of Fame was originally sponsored by the NHL and <a href="Hockey%20Canada">Hockey Canada</a> and revenue is generated mainly through admissions.

The Hockey Hall of Fame has 15 exhibit areas covering . Visitors can view trophies, memorabilia and equipment worn by players during special games. The "Esso Great Hall", described as "a Cathedral to the icons of Hockey", contains portraits and biographical information about every Hall of Fame honoured member. The centrepiece of the Great Hall is the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>; for part of the year a replica is put on display when the presentation cup travels outside of the Hall of Fame. The original version of the Cup and the older rings, as well as all of the current <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20awards">National Hockey League trophies</a>, are displayed in the bank vault, an alcove off the Great Hall. The Hall of Fame induction ceremony is annually held in the Great Hall.
The "NHL Zone" is a large area featuring displays relating to the NHL. Current teams and players are highlighted in the "NHL Today" area, while the "NHL Retro" displays include memorabilia and information about every NHL team past and present. The "NHL Legends" area features rotating exhibits focusing on honoured members; and "NHL Milestones" displays exhibits of noteworthy records including <a href="Darryl%20Sittler">Darryl Sittler</a>'s ten-point game and <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>'s all-time points record. The "Stanley Cup dynasties" exhibit features displays that include memorabilia from the rosters of nine teams considered to be dynasties because they dominated the NHL for several years at a time. This area also has a replica of the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>' dressing room as it existed at the old <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a>. The "Panasonic Hometown Hockey" section is dedicated to grassroots hockey in North America; it includes exhibits about various leagues and sections on women's and disabled hockey leagues. Special exhibits in the past included an exhibit in 2000 showcasing Gretzky memorabilia.

Interactive displays are featured in the "NHLPA Be A Player Zone". At the "Source For Sports Shoot Out", visitors take shots using real pucks at a computer simulation of <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> <a href="Ed%20Belfour">Ed Belfour</a>. Its counterpart, "Lay's Shut Out", has visitors playing goaltender, blocking shots from computer simulations of players Wayne Gretzky and <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a>. The "<a href="The%20Sports%20Network">TSN</a>/<a href="R%C3%A9seau%20des%20sports">RDS</a> Broadcast Zone" provides a look at how hockey broadcasting works and allows users to record messages that may be displayed on both the Hockey Hall of Fame's website, and the TSN/RDS networks.

While many of the Hall of Fame exhibits are dedicated to the NHL, there is a large section devoted to hockey leagues and players outside North America. On June 29, 1998, the "World of Hockey Zone" opened. It is a area dedicated to international hockey, including World and <a href="Winter%20Olympics">Olympic competition</a> and contains profiles on all <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">IIHF</a> member Countries.

As of 2009, new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes coaches, <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20General%20Managers">general manager</a>s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961 and a "veteran player" category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players". Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.

Candidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an 18-person selection committee. The committee consists of Hockey Hall of Fame members, hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game; the membership is representative of "areas throughout the world where hockey is popular", and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey. Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three-year term. The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members. As of November 2018, the selection committee consists of: chairman <a href="John%20Davidson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Davidson</a>, <a href="Jim%20Gregory%20%28ice%20hockey%29">James M. Gregory</a> (Chairman Emeritus), and committee members <a href="David%20Branch">David Branch</a>, <a href="Brian%20Burke%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Brian Burke</a>, <a href="Colin%20Campbell%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Colin Campbell</a>, <a href="Cassie%20Campbell-Pascall">Cassie Campbell-Pascall</a>, <a href="Mark%20Chipman">Mark Chipman</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Clarke">Bob Clarke</a>, <a href="Marc%20de%20Foy">Marc de Foy</a>, <a href="Michael%20Farber">Michael Farber</a>, <a href="Ron%20Francis">Ron Francis</a>, <a href="Mike%20Gartner">Mike Gartner</a>, <a href="Anders%20Hedberg">Anders Hedberg</a>, <a href="Jari%20Kurri">Jari Kurri</a>, <a href="Igor%20Larionov">Igor Larionov</a>, <a href="Pierre%20McGuire">Pierre McGuire</a>, <a href="Bob%20McKenzie%20%28broadcaster%29">Bob McKenzie</a>, <a href="David%20Poile">David Poile</a>, and <a href="Luc%20Robitaille">Luc Robitaille</a>.

Each committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each category per year. Nominations must be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors by April 15 of the nomination year. The committee then meets in June where a series of <a href="secret%20ballot">secret ballot</a> votes is held; any player with the support of 75% of the members of the committee present is inducted. If the maximum number of players does not receive 75% after the first round of voting, then run-off votes are held. Players with less than 50% are dropped from consideration for that year and voting continues until either the maximum number of inductees is reached or all remaining nominees receive between 50% and 75%. In any given year, a maximum of four players, two builders, and one on-ice official are inducted as members. Player and on-ice officials must have not participated in a professional or international game for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination. <a href="List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23Builders">Builders</a> may be "active or inactive".
The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable; <a href="Dit%20Clapper">Dit Clapper</a> (1947), <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice Richard</a> (1961), <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a> (1966), <a href="Red%20Kelly">Red Kelly</a> (1969), <a href="Terry%20Sawchuk">Terry Sawchuk</a> (1971), <a href="Jean%20B%C3%A9liveau">Jean Béliveau</a> (1972), <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> (1972), <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a> (1979), <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> (1997), and <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> (1999). Following Gretzky's induction, the Board of Directors determined that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under "certain humanitarian circumstances". Three Hall of Fame members came out of retirement after their induction and resumed a career in the National League: <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>, <a href="Guy%20Lafleur">Guy Lafleur</a> and <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>. <a href="Chris%20Pronger">Chris Pronger</a> was inducted in 2015 while still technically an active player; in his case, he had signed a contract with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> that was not due to expire until after the 2016–17 season. The Hall of Fame amended its by-laws by introducing the "three-year waiting period", which made Pronger eligible for induction because he had not played since 2011.

On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame announced new by-law additions which were implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder does not need to have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.

There is also a category for "Media honourees". The <a href="Elmer%20Ferguson%20Memorial%20Award">Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award</a> is awarded by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association to "distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey". The <a href="Foster%20Hewitt%20Memorial%20Award">Foster Hewitt Memorial Award</a> is awarded by the NHL Broadcasters' Association to "members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting". The voting for both awards is conducted by their respective associations. While media honourees are not considered full inductees, they are still honoured with a display at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The ceremonies associated with these awards are held separately from the induction of the members of the Hall of Fame. Some of the award winners have also been inducted into the Hall of Fame as builders, including <a href="Foster%20Hewitt">Foster Hewitt</a>.

The induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from 1959 until 1974. In 1975, it was held at the <a href="Fairmont%20Royal%20York">Royal York Hotel</a> in Toronto and would be held there until 1979. From 1980 to 1992, the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto, except for 1986, 1987 and 1991 when the ceremonies were held in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> respectively. Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building. The ceremony was first broadcast by <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">The Sports Network</a> in 1994. In 1999 the "Hockey Hall of Fame game" was established, a contest between the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year's inductees held before the game. Robert Tychkowski of the "<a href="Edmonton%20Sun">Edmonton Sun</a>" reports that many, including <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> president <a href="Kevin%20Lowe">Kevin Lowe</a>, believe the induction ceremony should be held on a night when there are no NHL games scheduled. This would allow a more representative portion of the hockey world to attend.

The Hall of Fame has been criticized for inducting several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to "a shortage of true greatness". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is more of an "NHL Hall of Fame" than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame opened an International Hockey exhibit and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction. <a href="Valeri%20Kharlamov">Valeri Kharlamov</a> was inducted in 2005, and is one of the few modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> players and overrepresenting the <a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a> era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, <a href="Angela%20James">Angela James</a> and <a href="Cammi%20Granato">Cammi Granato</a> were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

One of the most discussed potential nominees is <a href="Paul%20Henderson">Paul Henderson</a>, who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the <a href="Summit%20Series">1972 Summit Series</a> between Canada and the Soviet Union. This is one of the best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.

<a href="Conn%20Smythe">Conn Smythe</a> served as the Hall's chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when <a href="Busher%20Jackson">Harvey "Busher" Jackson</a> was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Toronto Maple Leafs players as "Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I'll get out as chairman of the board." Jackson was notorious for his off-ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages. Smythe would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model. <a href="Frank%20J.%20Selke">Frank J. Selke</a>, head of the selection committee defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out "because of the amount of beer he drank".

On March 30, 1993, it was announced that <a href="Gil%20Stein%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Gil Stein</a>, who at the time had been president of the National Hockey League for nine months but had been bypassed for the new job of commissioner in favour of <a href="Gary%20Bettman">Gary Bettman</a>, would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors. Due to these allegations, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hired two independent lawyers, <a href="Arnold%20Burns">Arnold Burns</a> and <a href="Yves%20Fortier%20%28lawyer%29">Yves Fortier</a>, to lead an investigation. They concluded that Stein had "improperly manipulated the process" and "created the false appearance and illusion" that his nomination was the idea of <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a>. They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman. There was a dispute over McNall's role and Stein was "categorical in stating that the idea was Mr. McNall's". They recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, but it was revealed Stein had decided to turn down the induction before their announcement.

In 1989, <a href="Alan%20Eagleson">Alan Eagleson</a>, a longtime executive director of the <a href="NHL%20Players%20Association">National Hockey League Players Association</a>, was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to <a href="Mail%20and%20wire%20fraud">mail fraud</a> and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%27%20Association">National Hockey League Players' Association</a> pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a>, <a href="Ted%20Lindsay">Ted Lindsay</a> and <a href="Brad%20Park">Brad Park</a>, campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.

Space Invaders

"Space Invaders" was an immediate commercial success; by 1982, it had <a href="Gross%20revenue">grossed</a> $3.8 billion, with a <a href="net%20profit">net profit</a> of $450 million, making it the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">best-selling video game</a> and <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20arcade%20games">highest-grossing</a> "entertainment product" at the time. Adjusted for inflation, the many versions of the game are estimated to have grossed over $13 billion in total revenue as of 2016, making it the <a href="Highest-grossing%20video%20game%20franchises%20of%20all%20time">highest-grossing video game</a> of all time.

"Space Invaders" helped expand the <a href="video%20game%20industry">video game industry</a> from a novelty to a global industry. The game has been the inspiration for other <a href="Video%20game">video games</a>, and has been <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">ported</a> and re-released in various forms. The 1980 <a href="Atari%202600">Atari VCS</a> version "quadrupled" sales of the VCS, thereby becoming the first "<a href="killer%20app">killer app</a>" for <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>s. More broadly, the <a href="Pixelation">pixelated</a> enemy alien has become a <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a> icon, often representing video games as a whole.

Designer Nishikado drew inspiration from games like 1976's ball-bouncing game "<a href="Breakout%20%28video%20game%29">Breakout</a>" and the 1975 shooter game "<a href="Gun%20Fight">Gun Fight</a>", as well as science fiction narratives such as "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds">The War of the Worlds</a>", "<a href="Space%20Battleship%20Yamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a>", and "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>". To complete development of the game, he had to design custom hardware and <a href="development%20tools">development tools</a>.

"Space Invaders" is a <a href="fixed%20shooter">fixed shooter</a> in which the player controls a <a href="Laser%20cannon">laser cannon</a> by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—although some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player's laser cannon is partially protected by several stationary defense <a href="Bunker">bunkers</a>—the number also varies by version—that are gradually destroyed from the top and bottom by blasts from either the aliens or the player.

The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the <a href="video%20game%20music">game's music</a> both speed up. Defeating all the aliens on-screen brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue endlessly. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.

The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game ends tragically. The game will also end if all the player's cannons are destroyed by the enemies.

"Space Invaders" was created by Japanese designer <a href="Tomohiro%20Nishikado">Tomohiro Nishikado</a>, who spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary <a href="Hardware%20%28computer%29">hardware</a> to produce it. The game's inspiration is reported to have come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game "<a href="Space%20Monsters">Space Monsters</a>" released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> when they are attacked by invading aliens. Nishikado himself has cited <a href="Atari">Atari</a>'s arcade game "<a href="Breakout%20%28arcade%20game%29">Breakout</a>" as his inspiration. He aimed to create a <a href="Shooting%20game">shooting game</a> that featured the same sense of achievement from completing <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">stages</a> and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. The game uses a similar layout to that of "Breakout" but has altered <a href="Game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a>. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at moving enemies.

Early enemy designs for the game included tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was not satisfied with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but the designer considered shooting them immoral. After the release of the 1974 <a href="anime">anime</a> "<a href="Space%20Battleship%20Yamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a>" in Japan, and seeing a magazine feature about "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from a novel by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds">The War of the Worlds</a>", and created initial <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a> images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled "Space Monsters" after a popular song in Japan at the time, "", but was changed to "Space Invaders" by the designer's superiors.

Because <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s in Japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming "Space Invaders", Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the <a href="Arcade%20system%20board">arcade board</a> using the latest <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s from the United States. The game uses an <a href="Intel%208080">Intel 8080</a> <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> (CPU), displays <a href="raster%20graphics">raster graphics</a> on a <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT monitor</a>, and uses <a href="Monaural">monaural sound</a> hosted by a combination of <a href="Analogue%20electronics">analog circuitry</a> and a <a href="Texas%20Instruments%20SN76477">Texas Instruments SN76477</a> <a href="Sound%20chip">sound chip</a>. The adoption of a microprocessor was inspired by "<a href="Gun%20Fight">Gun Fight</a>" (1975), <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway's</a> microprocessor adaptation of Nishikado's earlier <a href="Discrete%20logic">discrete logic</a> game "<a href="Western%20Gun">Western Gun</a>", after the designer was impressed by the improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway's version. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the <a href="Control%20Program%20for%20Microcomputers">Control Program</a> board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he ended up considering the development of the game's hardware the most difficult part of the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">render</a> the alien graphics faster when there were fewer on the screen. Rather than design in compensation for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> mechanism.

"Space Invaders" was first released in a <a href="Arcade%20cabinet%23Cocktail%20or%20table%20cabinets">cocktail-table</a> format arcade cabinet with black-and-white graphics, while Midway released the Western version in an <a href="Arcade%20cabinet%23Upright%20cabinets">upright cabinet</a>; it used strips of orange and green <a href="cellophane">cellophane</a> over the screen to simulate <a href="Color%20graphics">color graphics</a>. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a <a href="Natural%20satellite">moon</a> against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as "<a href="T.T.%20Space%20Invaders">T.T. Space Invaders</a>" in 1978, and were eventually followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> <a href="Monster">monsters</a> not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title of ""Space Monsters"", rather than referring to the actual in-game graphics.

Despite its simplicity, the music to "Space Invaders" was revolutionary for the gaming industry. Video game scholar <a href="Andrew%20Schartmann">Andrew Schartmann</a> identifies three aspects of the music that had a significant impact on the development of game music:
In the first few months following its release in Japan, "Space Invaders" became popular. Specialty <a href="Video%20arcade">arcades</a> opened with nothing but "Space Invaders" cabinets, and by the end of 1978 <a href="Taito">Taito</a> had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over 600 million in Japan alone. By 1980, Taito had sold over 300,000 "Space Invaders" arcade machines in Japan, and 60,000 machines in the United States within one year, where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine. By mid-1981, "Space Invaders" machines had grossed more than four billion <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarters</a>, or $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million a year until 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $ in 2019), with a <a href="net%20profit">net profit</a> of $450 million (equivalent to $ in 2019). This made it the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">best-selling video game</a> and <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20arcade%20games">highest-grossing</a> "entertainment product" of its time, with comparisons made to the then <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">highest-grossing film</a> "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", which had grossed $486 million, with a net profit of $175 million. "Space Invaders" earned Taito profits of over $500 million.

The 1980 <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> version was the first official <a href="License">licensing</a> of an arcade game for consoles and became the first "<a href="killer%20app">killer app</a>" for <a href="Video%20game%20consoles">video game consoles</a> after quadrupling the system's sales. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home <a href="console%20game">console game</a>, making it the first title to sell over a million <a href="ROM%20cartridge">cartridges</a>. Other official <a href="Porting">ports</a> were released for the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit computer line</a> and <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a> console, while Taito later released it for the <a href="Nintendo%20Famicom">Nintendo Famicom</a> in 1985, but just in Japan. Numerous <a href="video%20game%20clone">unofficial clones</a> were made, such as the popular <a href="PC%20game">computer games</a> "<a href="Super%20Invader%20%28video%20game%29">Super Invader</a>" (1979) and "<a href="TI%20Invaders">TI Invaders</a>" (1981); the latter was the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PC%20video%20games">top-selling game</a> for the <a href="Texas%20Instruments%20TI-99/4A">Texas Instruments TI-99/4A</a> through at least 1982. Adjusted for <a href="inflation">inflation</a>, sales of all versions of "Space Invaders" combined are estimated to have exceeded $13 billion in gross revenue, making it the <a href="Highest-grossing%20video%20game%20franchises%20of%20all%20time">highest-grossing video game of all time</a>.

An <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> states that "Space Invaders"' popularity led to a shortage of <a href="100%20yen%20coin">100-yen coins</a> in Japan. In actuality, 100-<a href="yen">yen</a> coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years. Additionally, arcade operators would have emptied their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in <a href="Circulation%20%28currency%29">circulation</a>. Reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate "nothing out of the ordinary ... during the height of the "Space Invaders" invasion".

As one of the earliest <a href="Shooting%20games">shooting games</a>, "Space Invaders" set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. "Space Invaders" popularized a more interactive style of <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a>, with the enemies responding to the player-controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a <a href="High%20score">high score</a>, being the first to <a href="Saved%20game">save</a> the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, "Space Invaders" was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple <a href="Life%20%28video%20games%29">lives</a>, had to repel hordes of enemies, could <a href="Cover%20system">take cover</a> from enemy fire, and use <a href="Destructible%20environment">destructible</a> barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous <a href="Video%20game%20music">background soundtrack</a>, with four simple <a href="Diatonic%20and%20chromatic">diatonic</a> descending <a href="bass%20note">bass note</a>s repeating in a <a href="Loop%20%28music%29">loop</a>, which was <a href="Dynamic%20music">dynamic</a> and <a href="Tempo">changed pace</a> during stages, like a <a href="Heart%20sounds">heartbeat sound</a> that increases pace as enemies approached.

<a href="Video%20game%20developer">Game developers</a> including <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> (creator of the franchises "<a href="Donkey%20Kong">Donkey Kong</a>", "<a href="Super%20Mario">Super Mario</a>," and "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>"), <a href="Hideo%20Kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> ("<a href="Metal%20Gear">Metal Gear</a>"), and <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a> and <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> (both "<a href="Doom%20%28franchise%29">Doom</a>)" have cited "Space Invaders" as their introduction to video games. Miyamoto considers "Space Invaders" to be the game that revolutionized the <a href="video%20game%20industry">video game industry</a>. "<a href="Deus%20Ex">Deus Ex</a>" creator <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a> said: ""Space Invaders" and games like it represent the roots of everything we see today in gaming. It represents the birth of a new art form, one that literally changed the world. "Space Invaders" is important as an historical artefact, no less than the silent films of the early twentieth century or early printed books." Several publications ascribed the expansion of the <a href="video%20game%20industry">video game industry</a> from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">"Edge" magazine</a> attributed the shift of games from <a href="Bar">bars</a> and <a href="Amusement%20arcade">amusement arcades</a> to more mainstream locations, such as restaurants and <a href="Department%20store">department stores</a>, to "Space Invaders". Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an <a href="arcade%20machine">arcade machine</a>'s owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.

"Space Invaders" also moved the gaming industry from "<a href="Pong">Pong</a>"-inspired <a href="sports%20game">sports game</a>s, grounded in real-world situations, towards fantastical <a href="action%20game">action game</a>s. "Space Invaders" helped action games become the dominant <a href="Video%20game%20genres">genre</a> in arcades and on consoles. "Guinness World Records" considered "Space Invaders" one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". "Space Invaders" set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as <a href="Atari">Atari's</a> "<a href="Asteroids%20%28video%20game%29">Asteroids</a>", <a href="WMS%20Industries">Williams Electronics</a>' "<a href="Defender%20%28video%20game%29">Defender</a>", and <a href="Namco">Namco</a>'s "<a href="Galaxian">Galaxian</a>" and "<a href="Galaga">Galaga</a>", which were modeled after "Space Invaders"s gameplay and design. This influence could be said to extend to most shooting games released to the present day, including <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a>s (FPS) such as "<a href="Wolfenstein%20%28series%29">Wolfenstein</a>", "<a href="Doom%20%28series%29">Doom</a>", "<a href="Halo%20%28series%29">Halo</a>" and "<a href="Call%20of%20Duty">Call of Duty</a>". "Space Invaders" also had an influence on early computer <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon crawl</a> games such as "<a href="Dungeons%20of%20Daggorath">Dungeons of Daggorath</a>", which used similar <a href="Heart%20sounds">heartbeat sounds</a> to indicate player <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>. "Space Invaders" cabinets have become <a href="collector%27s%20items">collector's items</a>, with the <a href="Cocktail%20arcade%20cabinet">cocktail</a> and <a href="Arcade%20cabinet%23Mini%20cabinets">cabaret</a> versions being the rarest.

<a href="Technology%20journalism">Technology journalist</a> Jason Whittaker credited the game with ending the <a href="video%20game%20crash%20of%201977">video game crash of 1977</a>, caused by "<a href="Pong">Pong</a>" clones flooding the market, and beginning the <a href="golden%20age%20of%20video%20arcade%20games">golden age of video arcade games</a> (1978–1980s). According to "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", home console versions of "Space Invaders" were popular and encouraged users to learn to program; many became industry leaders. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> stated that "Space Invaders" showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> attributed the launch of the "arcade phenomenon" in North America in part to "Space Invaders". "<a href="Electronic%20Games">Electronic Games</a>" credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby, and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" considered it, along with "<a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>", one of the most popular arcade games; it tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades. "Space Invaders" was inducted into the <a href="World%20Video%20Game%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Video Game Hall of Fame</a> in 2016.

In 1996, <a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">"Next Generation" magazine</a> put "Space Invaders" at number 97 on their list of the "Top 100 Games of All Time", saying that it "provides an elegance and simplicity not found in later games like "<a href="Phoenix%20%28video%20game%29">Phoenix</a>" [1980]." IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing it as a source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the <a href="Shooter%20game">shooting genre</a>. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" ranked it No. 1 on its list of "The ten most influential video games ever" in 2007. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 on its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to <a href="Simulation%20video%20game">simulate</a> already-existing things," "Space Invaders" was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" named "Space Invaders" one of the top ten games for the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> home console in 2013. In 2018, it was ranked 87th in <a href="Video%20Game%20Canon">Video Game Canon</a>'s statistical <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of 48 "top games" lists published between 1995 and 2017.

"Space Invaders" has been remade on numerous platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include <a href="Porting">ported</a> and updated versions of the original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> options—for example, "moving" defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay. Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Extreme">Space Invaders Extreme</a>", released on the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay. A 2008 <a href="Spin-off%20game">spin-off</a> for <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a>, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Get%20Even">Space Invaders Get Even</a>", allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon in a little bit of role reversal.

In 1980, <a href="Bally-Midway">Bally-Midway</a> released a <a href="pinball">pinball</a> version of the game. However, few elements from the original game are included, and the aliens instead resemble the <a href="Alien%20%28Alien%20franchise%29">xenomorphs</a> from the film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>"; Bally-Midway was later sued over the game's resemblance to the designs by <a href="H.%20R.%20Giger">H. R. Giger</a>. Ports of the game have been met with mixed receptions; the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> version was very successful, while the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> version was poorly received.

<a href="Taito">Taito</a> has released several arcade <a href="Video%20game%20sequel">sequels</a>. The first was "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Part%20II">Space Invaders Part II</a>" in 1979; it featured color graphics, an <a href="attract%20mode">attract mode</a>, new gameplay elements, and added an <a href="Cut%20scene">intermission between gameplay</a>. According to the "<a href="Killer%20List%20of%20Video%20Games">Killer List of Video Games</a>", this was the first video game to include an <a href="intermission">intermission</a>. The game also allowed the player with the top score to sign their name on the <a href="High%20score%20table">high score table</a>. This version was released in the United States as "<a href="Deluxe%20Space%20Invaders">Deluxe Space Invaders</a>" (also known as "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Deluxe">Space Invaders Deluxe</a>"), but it featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city background. Another arcade sequel, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20II">Space Invaders II</a>", was released exclusively in the United States. It was in a <a href="Cocktail%20arcade%20cabinet">cocktail-table format</a> with very fast alien firing and a competitive <a href="Two-player%20game">two-player mode</a>. During the summer of 1985, "<a href="Return%20Of%20The%20Invaders">Return of the Invaders</a>" was released with updated color graphics and more complex movements and attack patterns for the aliens. Subsequent arcade sequels included "<a href="Super%20Space%20Invaders%20%2791">Super Space Invaders '91</a>", "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20DX">Space Invaders DX</a>", and "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20%2795">Space Invaders 95</a>". Each game introduced minor gameplay additions to the original design. Like the original game, several of the arcade sequels have become collector's items, though some are considered rarer. In 2002, Taito released "<a href="Space%20Raiders%20%28video%20game%29">Space Raiders</a>", a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> reminiscent of "Space Invaders".

The game and its related games have been included in <a href="Video%20game%20compilation">video game compilation titles</a>. "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Anniversary">Space Invaders Anniversary</a>" was released in 2003 for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and included nine "Space Invader" variants. A similar title for the PlayStation Portable, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Pocket">Space Invaders Pocket</a>", was released in 2005. "Space Invaders", "Space Invaders Part II" and "Return of the Invaders" are included in "<a href="Taito%20Legends">Taito Legends</a>", a compilation of Taito's classic arcade games released in 2005 on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC. "Super Space Invaders '91", "Space Invaders DX", and "Space Invaders 95" were included in "<a href="Taito%20Legends%202">Taito Legends 2</a>", a sequel compilation released in 2006. In April 2017, a redemption game by <a href="Raw%20Thrills">Raw Thrills</a>, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20Frenzy">Space Invaders Frenzy</a>", was released.

A stand-alone version was released by <a href="Super%20Impulse">Super Impulse</a> as part of its <a href="Tiny%20Arcade">"Tiny Arcade" series</a>, along with the <a href="Bandai%20Namco%20Entertainment">Namco</a> games "<a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>", "<a href="Ms.%20Pac-Man">Ms. Pac-Man</a>", and "<a href="Galaxian">Galaxian</a>".

Many publications and websites use the <a href="Pixelation">pixelated</a> alien <a href="Video%20game%20graphics">graphic</a> as an <a href="Mascot">icon</a> for video games in general, including the video game magazine "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", technology website <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a>, and concert event <a href="Video%20Games%20Live">Video Games Live</a>. There has also been "Space Invaders-"themed <a href="merchandising">merchandising</a>, including necklaces and puzzles. The trend continues to this day, with handmade sites like <a href="Etsy">Etsy</a> and <a href="Pinterest">Pinterest</a> showcasing thousands of handmade items featuring "Space Invaders" characters.

The game—and references to it—has appeared in numerous facets of <a href="Popular%20culture">popular culture</a>. Soon after the game's release, hundreds of favorable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium as popularized by "Space Invaders" aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The <a href="Space%20Invaders%20Tournament">Space Invaders Tournament</a>, held by Atari in 1980 and won by <a href="Bill%20Heineman">Bill Heineman</a>, was the first <a href="electronic%20sports">electronic sports</a> (eSports) event, and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing <a href="Video%20game%20culture">video gaming</a> as a <a href="mainstream">mainstream</a> hobby. The <a href="Electronic%20Games">Arcade Awards</a> ceremony was created that same year to honor the best video games, with "Space Invaders" winning the first <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> (GoTY) award. The impact of "Space Invaders" on the <a href="Video%20game%20industry">video game industry</a> has been compared to that of <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> in the pop music industry. Considered "the first '<a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a>' video game," "Space Invaders" became synonymous with video games worldwide for some time.

Within a year of the game's release, the Japanese <a href="Parent-Teacher%20Association">PTA</a> unsuccessfully attempted to ban the game for allegedly inspiring <a href="truancy">truancy</a>. In North America, doctors identified a condition called the ""Space Invaders" elbow" as a complaint, while a physician in "<a href="The%20New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>" named a similar ailment the ""Space Invaders" Wrist". "Space Invaders" was also the first game to attract <a href="Video%20game%20controversy">political controversy</a> when a 1981 <a href="Private%20Member%27s%20Bill">Private Member's Bill</a> known as the "Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill", drafted by <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Labour</a> <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> <a href="George%20Foulkes%2C%20Baron%20Foulkes%20of%20Cumnock">George Foulkes</a>, attempted to allow <a href="City%20council">local councils</a> to restrict the game and those like it by <a href="License">licensing</a> for its "<a href="Video%20game%20addiction">addictive properties</a>" and for causing "<a href="deviancy">deviancy</a>". <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP <a href="Michael%20Brown%20%28British%20politician%29">Michael Brown</a> defended the game as "innocent and harmless pleasure", which he himself had enjoyed that day, and criticized the bill as an example of "<a href="Socialist">Socialist</a> beliefs in restriction and control". A motion to bring the bill before <a href="Parliament">Parliament</a> was defeated by 114 votes to 94 votes; the bill itself was never considered by Parliament.

Musicians have drawn inspiration for their music from "Space Invaders". The pioneering <a href="J-pop">Japanese</a> <a href="synthpop">synthpop</a> group <a href="Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a> reproduced "Space Invaders" sounds in its 1978 <a href="Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a> and hit single "Computer Game", the latter selling over 400,000 copies in the United States. Other pop songs based on "Space Invaders" soon followed, including <a href="disco">disco</a> records such as "Disco Space Invaders" (1979) by <a href="Funny%20Stuff">Funny Stuff</a>, and the hit songs "<a href="Pretenders%20%28album%29">Space Invader</a>" (1980) by <a href="Pretenders%20%28band%29">The Pretenders</a>, "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20%28Uncle%20Vic%20song%29">Space Invaders</a>" (1980) by <a href="Uncle%20Vic">Uncle Vic</a>, and the Australian hit "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20%28Player%20One%20song%29">Space Invaders</a>" (1979) by <a href="Player%20One%20%28band%29">Player One</a> (known in the US as 'Playback'), which in turn provided the <a href="bassline">bassline</a> for <a href="Jesse%20Saunders">Jesse Saunders</a>' "<a href="On%20and%20On%20%28Jesse%20Saunders%20song%29">On and On</a>" (1984), the first <a href="Chicago%20house">Chicago</a> <a href="house%20music">house music</a> track.

<a href="Video%20Games%20Live">Video Games Live</a> performed audio from the game as part of a special <a href="Retrogaming">retro</a> "Classic Arcade <a href="Medley%20%28music%29">Medley</a>" in 2007. In honor of the game's 30th anniversary, <a href="Taito">Taito</a> produced an album titled "<a href="Space%20Invaders%202008">Space Invaders 2008</a>". The album is published by <a href="Avex%20Trax">Avex Trax</a> and features music inspired by the game. Taito's store, Taito Station, also unveiled a "Space Invaders" themed <a href="Music%20video">music video</a>.

In the 1982 original pilot of the series "<a href="The%20Powers%20of%20Matthew%20Star">The Powers of Matthew Star</a>", David Star uses his powers to <a href="Cheating%20in%20video%20games">cheat the game</a>. The game is shown with a colored backdrop of the moon. Multiple <a href="Television%20series">television series</a> have aired episodes that either reference or parody the game and its elements; for example, "<a href="Danger%20Mouse%20%281981%20TV%20series%29">Danger Mouse</a>", "<a href="That%20%2770s%20Show">That '70s Show</a>", "<a href="Scrubs%20%28TV%20series%29">Scrubs</a>", "<a href="Chuck%20%28TV%20series%29">Chuck</a>", "<a href="Robot%20Chicken">Robot Chicken</a>", and "<a href="The%20Amazing%20World%20of%20Gumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a>".

On February 13, 2015, <a href="Daniel%20Kunka">Daniel Kunka</a> was set to write the script for the film.

Various books have been published about "Space Invaders", including "" (1982) by <a href="Martin%20Amis">Martin Amis</a>, "" (2006) by <a href="Geof%20King">Geof King</a> and <a href="Tanya%20Krzywinska">Tanya Krzywinska</a>, and "<a href="Space%20Invaders%20%28book%29">Space Invaders</a>" (1980) by <a href="Mark%20Roeder">Mark Roeder</a> and <a href="Julian%20Wolanski">Julian Wolanski</a>.

In 2006, the game was one of several video game-related media selected to represent Japan as part of a project compiled by <a href="Japanese%20Culture">Japan's</a> <a href="Agency%20for%20Cultural%20Affairs">Agency for Cultural Affairs</a>. That same year, "Space Invaders" was included in the London <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum</a>'s <a href="Game%20On%20exhibition">Game On exhibition</a>, meant to showcase the various aspects of <a href="Video%20game%20history">video game history</a>, <a href="Video%20game%20development">development</a>, and <a href="Video%20game%20culture">culture</a>. (The game is a part of the <a href="Barbican%20Centre">Barbican Centre</a>'s traveling <a href="Game%20On%20exhibition">Game On exhibition</a>.)

At the <a href="Belluard%20Bollwerk%20International">Belluard Bollwerk International</a> 2006 festival in <a href="Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, Switzerland, Guillaume Reymond created a three-minute video recreation of a game of "Space Invaders" as part of the "Gameover" project using humans as pixels.

The <a href="GH%20ART">GH ART</a> exhibit at the 2008 <a href="Games%20Convention">Games Convention</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Germany, included an <a href="art%20game">art game</a>, "<a href="Invaders%21%20%28game%29">Invaders!</a>", based on "Space Invaders"s gameplay. The creator later asked for the game to be removed from the exhibit following criticism of elements based on the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in the United States.

There is a bridge in <a href="C%C3%A1ceres%2C%20Spain">Cáceres, Spain</a>, projected by engineers Pedro Plasencia and Hadrián Arias, whose pavement design is based on the game. The laser cannon, some shots, and several figures can be seen on the deck.

A French <a href="street%20artist">street artist</a>, <a href="Invader%20%28artist%29">Invader</a>, made a name for himself by creating <a href="Mosaic">mosaic artwork</a> of "Space Invader" aliens around the world.

In 2014, two Brazilian <a href="zoologists">zoologists</a> described a new species of <a href="arachnid">arachnid</a> as "Taito spaceinvaders" Kury & Barros, 2014, inspired after the game, because of the resemblance of a fleck in the dorsal <a href="Scute">scutum</a> of the animal with a typical alien in the game.

In 2018, <a href="Highways%20England">Highways England</a> launched a <a href="Political%20campaign">campaign</a> titled “Don’t be a Space Invader, Stay Safe, Stay Back” to raise awareness on the dangers of <a href="tailgating">tailgating</a>.

Jaws (film)

Jaws is a 1975 American <a href="thriller%20film">thriller film</a> directed by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and based on <a href="Peter%20Benchley">Peter Benchley</a>'s 1974 <a href="Jaws%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. In the film, a giant <a href="Man-eater">man-eating</a> <a href="great%20white%20shark">great white shark</a> attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional <a href="New%20England">New England</a> summer <a href="resort%20town">resort town</a>, prompting police chief <a href="Martin%20Brody">Martin Brody</a> (<a href="Roy%20Scheider">Roy Scheider</a>) to hunt it with the help of a <a href="Marine%20biology">marine biologist</a> (<a href="Richard%20Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>) and a professional shark hunter (<a href="Robert%20Shaw%20%28actor%29">Robert Shaw</a>). <a href="Murray%20Hamilton">Murray Hamilton</a> plays the mayor, and <a href="Lorraine%20Gary">Lorraine Gary</a> portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer <a href="Carl%20Gottlieb">Carl Gottlieb</a>, who rewrote the script during <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a>.

Shot mostly on location on <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a> in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, "Jaws" had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalistic theme created by composer <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a> to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of thriller director <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>. <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a> gave the film what was then an exceptionally <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a> for a <a href="Major%20film%20studio">major studio</a> picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.

Considered one of the <a href="list%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">greatest films ever made</a>, "Jaws" was the prototypical summer <a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a>, with its release regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It became the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">highest-grossing film of all time</a> until the release of "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which revolves around high box-office returns from action and adventure pictures with simple <a href="high-concept">high-concept</a> premises released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. It was followed by <a href="Jaws%20%28franchise%29">three sequels</a>, all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="nude%20swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="treading%20water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="shark%20attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.

When local fishermen catch a <a href="tiger%20shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="great%20white%20shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.

Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the "Orca", to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.

At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="USS%20Indianapolis%20%28CA-35%29">USS "Indianapolis"</a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.

With the "Orca" slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="Scuba%20set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a href="shark-proof%20cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.

<a href="Richard%20D.%20Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a href="David%20Brown%20%28producer%29">David Brown</a>, producers at <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a>, independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel "<a href="Jaws%20%28novel%29">Jaws</a>". Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Cosmopolitan</a>", then edited by his wife, <a href="Helen%20Gurley%20Brown">Helen Gurley Brown</a>. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.

To direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker <a href="John%20Sturges">John Sturges</a>—whose résumé included another maritime adventure, "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea%20%281958%20film%29">The Old Man and the Sea</a>"—before offering the job to <a href="Dick%20Richards">Dick Richards</a>, whose directorial debut, "<a href="The%20Culpepper%20Cattle%20Co.">The Culpepper Cattle Co.</a>" had come out the previous year. However, they grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project. Meanwhile, <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, "<a href="The%20Sugarland%20Express">The Sugarland Express</a>", for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated. He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film "<a href="Duel%20%281971%20film%29">Duel</a>" in that both deal with "these leviathans targeting <a href="everyman">everymen</a>". After Richards's departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of "The Sugarland Express".

Before production began, however, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with "Jaws", in fear of becoming <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as the "truck and shark director". He wanted to move over to <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>'s "<a href="Lucky%20Lady">Lucky Lady</a>" instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that "after ["Jaws"], you can make all the films you want". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5 million and a shooting schedule of 55 days. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.

For the screen adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stay with the novel's basic plot, but discarded many of Benchley's <a href="subplot">subplot</a>s. He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120 pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, "I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third." When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a>. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%2C%20West">Writer's Guild</a> strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, "I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do." Benchley would later describe his contribution to the finished film as "the storyline and the ocean stuff – basically, the mechanics", given he "didn't know how to put the character texture into a screenplay." One of his changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the "Orca". During the film's production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.

Spielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchley's script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter <a href="John%20Byrum">John Byrum</a> to do a rewrite, but he declined the offer.
"<a href="Columbo">Columbo</a>" creators <a href="William%20Link">William Link</a> and <a href="Richard%20Levinson">Richard Levinson</a> also declined Spielberg's invitation. <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony</a> and <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning <a href="playwright">playwright</a> <a href="Howard%20Sackler">Howard Sackler</a> was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts, they quickly agreed. At the suggestion of Spielberg, Brody's characterization made him afraid of water, "coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts."

Spielberg wanted "some levity" in "Jaws", humor that would avoid making it "a dark sea hunt", so he turned to his friend <a href="Carl%20Gottlieb">Carl Gottlieb</a>, a comedy writer-actor then working on the sitcom "<a href="The%20Odd%20Couple%20%281970%20TV%20series%29">The Odd Couple</a>". Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing. Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.

While the deal was initially for a "one-week dialogue polish", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set, most notably Roy Scheider's <a href="ad-lib">ad-lib</a> of the line "You're gonna need a bigger boat." <a href="John%20Milius">John Milius</a> contributed dialogue polishes, and "Sugarland Express" writers <a href="Matthew%20Robbins%20%28screenwriter%29">Matthew Robbins</a> and <a href="Hal%20Barwood">Hal Barwood</a> also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a "big rousing ending". The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.

Benchley had written "Jaws" after reading about sport fisherman <a href="Frank%20Mundus">Frank Mundus</a>'s capture of an enormous shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book "Sportfishing for Sharks" he read for research. Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II disaster. The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint's monologue about the "Indianapolis" has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor <a href="Robert%20Shaw%20%28actor%29">Robert Shaw</a>, who was also a playwright. According to the director, Milius turned Sackler's "three-quarters of a page" speech into a monologue, and that was then rewritten by Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius's contribution.

Though Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that "somewhat anonymous" performers would help the audience "believe this was happening to people like you and me", whereas "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes ... corrupt the story." The director added that in his plans "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were <a href="Lorraine%20Gary">Lorraine Gary</a>, the wife of then-president of Universal <a href="Sid%20Sheinberg">Sid Sheinberg</a>, as Ellen Brody, and <a href="Murray%20Hamilton">Murray Hamilton</a> as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress <a href="Susan%20Backlinie">Susan Backlinie</a> was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer <a href="Jeffrey%20Kramer">Jeffrey Kramer</a>.

The role of Brody was offered to <a href="Robert%20Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>, but the actor was interested only in portraying Quint. <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> expressed a desire for the role, but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for the part of a police chief of a modest community. <a href="Roy%20Scheider">Roy Scheider</a> became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party talk with a screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat. Spielberg was initially apprehensive about hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a "tough guy", similar to his role in "<a href="The%20French%20Connection%20%28film%29">The French Connection</a>".

Nine days before the start of production, neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast. The role of Quint was originally offered to actors <a href="Lee%20Marvin">Lee Marvin</a> and <a href="Sterling%20Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a>, both of whom passed. Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on "<a href="The%20Sting">The Sting</a>", and suggested him to Spielberg. Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book, but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife, actress <a href="Mary%20Ure">Mary Ure</a>, and his secretary—"The last time they were that enthusiastic was "<a href="From%20Russia%20with%20Love%20%28film%29">From Russia with Love</a>". And they were right." Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer, and legendary eccentric, who was playing fisherman Ben Gardner. Spielberg described Kingsbury as "the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was", and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of Gardner and Quint. Another source for some of Quint's dialogue and mannerisms, especially in the third act at sea, was Vineyard mechanic and boat-owner Lynn Murphy.

For the role of Hooper, Spielberg initially wanted <a href="Jon%20Voight">Jon Voight</a>. <a href="Timothy%20Bottoms">Timothy Bottoms</a>, <a href="Joel%20Grey">Joel Grey</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> were also considered for the part. Spielberg's friend <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a> suggested <a href="Richard%20Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>, whom he had directed in "<a href="American%20Graffiti">American Graffiti</a>". The actor initially passed, but changed his decision after he attended a pre-release screening of "<a href="The%20Apprenticeship%20of%20Duddy%20Kravitz%20%28film%29">The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz</a>", which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once "Kravitz" was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in "Jaws". Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley's novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it. As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor, as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as his "<a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>".

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began May 2, 1974, on the island of <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, Massachusetts, selected after consideration was given to eastern <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. Brown explained later that the production "needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business." Martha's Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a sandy bottom that never dropped below for out from shore, which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land. As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close-up to resemble what people see while swimming, cinematographer <a href="Bill%20Butler%20%28cinematographer%29">Bill Butler</a> devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable regardless of tide and a sealed submersible camera box. Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock.

Three full-size <a href="Pneumatics">pneumatically</a> powered prop sharks—which the film crew nicknamed "Bruce" after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce Ramer—were made for the production: a "sea-sled shark", a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a line, and two "platform sharks", one that moved from camera-left to -right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. The sharks were designed by art director <a href="Joe%20Alves">Joe Alves</a> during the third quarter of 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper's Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Sun Valley, California</a>. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor <a href="Bob%20Mattey">Bob Mattey</a>, best known for creating the giant squid in "<a href="20%2C000%20Leagues%20Under%20the%20Sea%20%281954%20film%29">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a>". After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location. In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts.

"Jaws" was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, resulting in a troubled shoot and went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget "was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," he said. As for his lack of experience: "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." Gottlieb said that "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".

Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras got soaked, and the "Orca" once began to sink with the actors on board. The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>. From the first water test onward, the "non-absorbent" neoprene foam that made up the sharks' skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed. Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming. Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat's propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage. The actors were frequently <a href="seasickness">seasick</a>. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems, engaged in <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a>, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in "Duddy Kravitz". Editor <a href="Verna%20Fields">Verna Fields</a> rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg "we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day."
The delays proved beneficial in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film's suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, "The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller." In another interview, he similarly declared, "The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like <a href="Ray%20Harryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a>." The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: "The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances."

Footage of real sharks was shot by <a href="Ron%20and%20Valerie%20Taylor">Ron and Valerie Taylor</a> in the waters off <a href="Dangerous%20Reef">Dangerous Reef</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, with a short actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous. During the Taylors' shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time, however, and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used. As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, "The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss's character."

Although principal photography was scheduled to take 55 days, it did not <a href="Wrap%20%28filmmaking%29">wrap</a> until October 6, 1974, after 159 days. Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, "I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors ... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule." Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done. It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot. Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> water tank in <a href="Culver%20City">Culver City</a>, with stuntmen <a href="Dick%20Warlock">Dick Warlock</a> and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage, as well as near <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California">Santa Catalina Island, California</a>. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, "She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes." The boat used for the "Orca" was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.

Two scenes were altered following test screenings. As the audience's screams had covered up Scheider's "bigger boat" one-liner, Brody's reaction after the shark jumps behind him was extended, and the volume of the line was raised. Spielberg also decided that he was greedy for "one more scream", and reshot the scene in which Hooper discovers Ben Gardner's body, using $3,000 of his own money after Universal refused to pay for the reshoot. The underwater scene was shot in Fields's swimming pool in <a href="Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Encino, California</a>, using a <a href="Lifecasting">lifecast</a> latex model of Craig Kingsbury's head attached to a fake body, which was placed in the wrecked boat's hull. To simulate the murky waters of Martha's Vineyard, powdered milk was poured into the pool, which was then covered with a <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a>.

<a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a> composed the film's <a href="film%20score">score</a>, which earned him an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Academy Award</a> and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>. The main "shark" theme, a simple <a href="Double%20tonic">alternating pattern of two notes</a>—variously identified as "E and F" or "F and F sharp"—became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see <a href="leading-tone">leading-tone</a>). Williams described the theme as "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable." The piece was performed by tuba player <a href="Tommy%20Johnson%20%28tubist%29">Tommy Johnson</a>. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound "a little more threatening". When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between "Jaws" and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked "pirate music", which he called "primal, but fun and entertaining". Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>" by <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a> as well of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>".

There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time. Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark's heartbeat. According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> wrote for "<a href="Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a>", "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>", and particularly "<a href="Mysterious%20Island%20%281961%20film%29">Mysterious Island</a>", it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score's strongest motif is actually "the split, the rupture"—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie's death. The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme, which is exploited toward the film's climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.

Spielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, "The Sugarland Express", and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The <a href="Jaws%20%28soundtrack%29">original soundtrack for "Jaws"</a> was released by <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>/<a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal</a> reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and <a href="Var%C3%A8se%20Sarabande">Varèse Sarabande</a> put out a rerecording of the score performed by the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20National%20Orchestra">Royal Scottish National Orchestra</a>, conducted by <a href="Joel%20McNeely">Joel McNeely</a>.

<a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" is the most notable artistic antecedent to "Jaws". The character of Quint strongly resembles <a href="Ahab%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Captain Ahab</a>, the obsessed captain of the "<a href="Pequod%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Pequod</a>" who devotes his life to hunting a <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the "Orca", is named after the only <a href="Orca">natural enemy of the white shark</a>. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel. A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the <a href="Moby%20Dick%20%281956%20film%29">film version of "Moby-Dick"</a>; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from "Moby-Dick" could not be licensed from the film's star, <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a>, its copyright holder. Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a>": ""Jaws" is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway."

The underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, "<a href="Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>" and "<a href="The%20Monster%20That%20Challenged%20the%20World">The Monster That Challenged the World</a>". Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: "<a href="The%20Thing%20from%20Another%20World">The Thing from Another World</a>", which Gottlieb described as "a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel"; and "<a href="It%20Came%20From%20Outer%20Space">It Came From Outer Space</a>", where "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself". Scholars such as Thomas Schatz described how "Jaws" melds various genres while essentially being an <a href="action%20film">action film</a> and a <a href="thriller%20film">thriller</a>. Most is taken from <a href="Horror%20fiction">horror</a>, with the core of a nature-based <a href="monster%20movie">monster movie</a> while adding elements of a <a href="slasher%20film">slasher film</a>. The second half provides a <a href="buddy%20film">buddy film</a> in the interaction between the crew of the "Orca", and a <a href="Supernatural%20horror%20film">supernatural horror</a> based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. <a href="Ian%20Freer">Ian Freer</a> describes "Jaws" as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier <a href="monster%20film">monster film</a>s such as "<a href="King%20Kong">King Kong</a>" and "<a href="Godzilla%20%28franchise%29">Godzilla</a>". Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared "Jaws" to "Godzilla"; and Spielberg cited "<a href="Godzilla%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Monsters%21">Godzilla, King of the Monsters!</a>" (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the "masterful" way in which "it made you believe it was really happening."

Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s play "<a href="An%20Enemy%20of%20the%20People">An Enemy of the People</a>". Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to "Jaws" as ""Moby-Dick" meets "Enemy of the People"". The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in "Jaws" by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play".

"Jaws" has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>. He argues that Brody represents the "white male middle class—[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film", who restores public order "with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency". Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine "Jaws" as a signal example of the film as "industrial product" that sells on the basis of "the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of "Jaws" is to be the most profitable movie)".

Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it "a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence." He suggests that the experience of the film is "inconceivable" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself. In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that "individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change". <a href="Peter%20Biskind">Peter Biskind</a> argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by <a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a> filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip <a href="counterculture">counterculture</a> figures vs. "<a href="The%20Man">The Man</a>"—the overarching conflict in "Jaws" does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.

Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island, Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. "Authority must be restored", he writes, "but not by Quint". The seaman's "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint. Britton sees the film more as concerned with the "vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them", which in turn helps generate a "pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity".

<a href="Fredric%20Jameson">Fredric Jameson</a>'s analysis highlights the <a href="polysemy">polysemy</a> of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence." He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it."

<a href="Neal%20Gabler">Neal Gabler</a> analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.

Universal spent $1.8 million promoting "Jaws", including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee <a href="Roger%20Kastel">Roger Kastel</a>. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that "you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth."

More merchandise was created to take advantage of the film's release. In 1999, Graeme Turner wrote that "Jaws" was accompanied by what was still "probably the most elaborate array of tie-ins" of any film to date: "This included a sound-track album, T-shirts, plastic tumblers, a book about the making of the movie, the book the movie was based on, beach towels, blankets, shark costumes, toy sharks, hobby kits, iron-transfers, games, posters, shark's tooth necklaces, sleepwear, water pistols, and more." The <a href="Ideal%20Toy%20Company">Ideal Toy Company</a>, for instance, produced a <a href="The%20Game%20of%20Jaws">game</a> in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark's mouth before the jaws closed.

The glowing audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>, on March 28, along with the success of Benchley's novel and the early stages of Universal's marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio's plan to debut "Jaws" at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously. A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24. After Universal chairman <a href="Lew%20Wasserman">Lew Wasserman</a> attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film's initial release—planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters—to be cut down, declaring, "I want this picture to run all summer long. I don't want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood." Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a>. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the <a href="grindhouse">grindhouse</a> and <a href="Exploitation%20film">exploitation</a> side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of "<a href="Billy%20Jack">Billy Jack</a>" and the original release of its sequel "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20Billy%20Jack">The Trial of Billy Jack</a>", the "<a href="Dirty%20Harry">Dirty Harry</a>" sequel "<a href="Magnum%20Force">Magnum Force</a>", and the latest installments in the <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">James Bond series</a>. Still, the typical major studio <a href="film%20release">film release</a> at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>" in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.

On June 20, "Jaws" opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the remainder in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> had done something similar with a <a href="Charles%20Bronson">Charles Bronson</a> thriller, "<a href="Breakout%20%281975%20film%29">Breakout</a>", though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, "Jaws" opened in December at more than 100 theaters.

For its fortieth anniversary, the film was released in selected theaters (across approximately 500 theaters) in the United States on Sunday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 24, 2015.

"Jaws" opened with a $7 million weekend and recouped its production costs in two weeks. In just 78 days, it overtook "The Godfather" as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office, sailing past that picture's earnings of $86 million to become the first film to earn $100 million in US <a href="Gross%20rental">theatrical rentals</a>. Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals. Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.

The picture entered overseas release in December 1975, and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, Spain, and Mexico. By 1977, "Jaws" was the highest-grossing international release with worldwide rentals of $193 million, equating to about $400 million of gross revenue; it supplanted "The Godfather", which had earned $145 million in rentals.

"Jaws" was the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">highest-grossing film of all time</a> until "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", which debuted two years later. "Star Wars" surpassed "Jaws" for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978. Adjusted for inflation, "Jaws" has earned almost $2 billion worldwide at 2011 prices and is the second-most successful <a href="Media%20franchise">franchise</a> film after "Star Wars". In North America, it is the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20Canada%20and%20the%20United%20States%23Adjusted%20for%20ticket-price%20inflation">seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time</a>, with a total of $1.017 billion at current prices, based on an estimated 128,078,800 tickets sold. In the United Kingdom, it is the seventh-highest-grossing film to be released since 1975, earning the equivalent of over £70 million in 2009/10 currency, with admissions estimated at 16.2 million. "Jaws" has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, the second-highest attendance ever in the country behind "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>".

On television, the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> aired it for the first time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. broadcast attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie share at the time behind "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>". In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the <a href="List%20of%20most-watched%20television%20broadcasts">second-biggest TV audience ever for a feature film</a> behind "<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28film%29">Live and Let Die</a>".

"Jaws" received mostly positive reviews upon release. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" called it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings". <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>'s A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance "absolutely magnificent". According to "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>"s <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a>, it was "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... [with] more zest than an early <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a> picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For "<a href="New%20Times%20%28magazine%29">New Times</a>" magazine, <a href="Frank%20Rich">Frank Rich</a> wrote, "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in "Jaws" are those where we don't even see the shark." Writing for "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine, <a href="Judith%20Crist">Judith Crist</a> described the film as "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" and complimented its acting and "extraordinary technical achievements". <a href="Rex%20Reed">Rex Reed</a> praised the "nerve-frying" action scenes and concluded that "for the most part, "Jaws" is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".

The film was not without its detractors. <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote, "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like "Jaws", characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun". "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" critic <a href="Charles%20Champlin">Charles Champlin</a> disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that ""Jaws" is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." Marcia Magill of "<a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures">Films in Review</a>" said that while "Jaws" "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of "<a href="Commentary%20%28magazine%29">Commentary</a>" described "Jaws" as "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" and "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" similarly characterized it as a "scare machine that works with computer-like precision. ... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." "<a href="Halliwell%27s%20Film%20Guide">Halliwell's Film Guide</a>" stated that "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster."

"Jaws" won three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Original Dramatic Score</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound%20Mixing">Best Sound</a> (<a href="Robert%20Hoyt%20%28sound%20engineer%29">Robert Hoyt</a>, <a href="Roger%20Heman%20Jr">Roger Heman</a>, <a href="Earl%20Madery">Earl Madery</a>, and <a href="John%20Carter%20%28sound%20engineer%29">John Carter</a>). It was also nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, losing to "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28film%29">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>". Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>. Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Score%20Soundtrack%20for%20Visual%20Media">Grammy Award</a>, the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Music">BAFTA Award for Best Film Music</a>, and the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Golden Globe Award</a>. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the <a href="American%20Cinema%20Editors">American Cinema Editors</a>' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.

"Jaws" was chosen Favorite Movie at the <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Awards</a>. It was also nominated for best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Editing, and Sound at the <a href="29th%20British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">29th British Academy Film Awards</a>, and Best Film—Drama, Director, and Screenplay at the <a href="33rd%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">33rd Golden Globe Awards</a>. Spielberg was nominated by the <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America">Directors Guild of America</a> for a <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">DGA Award</a>, and the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%2C%20West">Writers Guild of America</a> nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script for <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Drama</a>.

In the years since its release, "Jaws" has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">the greatest movies of all time</a>. It was number 48 on American Film Institute's "<a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20...%20100%20Movies">100 Years ... 100 Movies</a>", a list of the greatest American films of all time compiled in 1998; it dropped to number 56 on the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20...%20100%20Movies%20%2810th%20Anniversary%20Edition%29">10-Year Anniversary list</a>. AFI also ranked the shark at number 18 on its list of the <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20...%20100%20Heroes%20%26amp%3B%20Villains">50 Best Villains</a>, Roy Scheider's line "You're gonna need a bigger boat" 35th on a list of <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20...%20100%20Movie%20Quotes">top 100 movie quotes</a>, Williams's score at sixth on a list of <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20of%20Film%20Scores">100 Years of Film Scores</a>, and the film as second on a list of <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years%20...%20100%20Thrills">100 most thrilling films</a>, behind only "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>". In 2003, "The New York Times" included the film on its list of the best 1,000 movies ever made. The following year, "Jaws" placed at the top of the <a href="Bravo%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">Bravo</a> network's five-hour miniseries "<a href="The%20100%20Scariest%20Movie%20Moments">The 100 Scariest Movie Moments</a>". The <a href="Chicago%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Chicago Film Critics Association</a> named it the sixth-scariest film ever made in 2006. In 2008, "Jaws" was ranked the fifth-greatest film in history by "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine, which also placed Quint at number 50 on its list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. The film has been cited in many other lists of 50 and 100 greatest films, including ones compiled by <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a>, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", "<a href="Film4">Film4</a>", "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>", "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", and "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>".

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>, recognizing it as a landmark horror film and the first "summer movie". In 2006, its screenplay was ranked the 63rd-best of all time by the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a>. In 2012, the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Editors%20Guild">Motion Picture Editors Guild</a> listed the film as the eighth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

"Jaws" was key in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy television advertising, rather than the traditional progressive release in which a film slowly entered new markets and built support over time. Saturation booking, in which a film opens simultaneously at thousands of cinemas, and massive media buys are now commonplace for the <a href="major%20film%20studio">major Hollywood studios</a>. According to <a href="Peter%20Biskind">Peter Biskind</a>, "Jaws" "diminish[ed] the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... Moreover, "Jaws" whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be "Jaws"." Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it "recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood's five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers."

"Jaws" also played a major part in establishing summer as the prime season for the release of studios' biggest box-office contenders, their intended <a href="blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbusters</a>; winter had long been the time when most hoped-for hits were distributed, while summer was largely reserved for dumping films thought likely to be poor performers. "Jaws" and "Star Wars" are regarded as marking the beginning of the new <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. film industry</a> business model dominated by "<a href="high-concept">high-concept</a>" pictures—with premises that can be easily described and marketed—as well as the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood period, which saw <a href="auteur">auteur</a> films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big-budget pictures. The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system; in Biskind's description, "Spielberg was the <a href="Trojan%20Horse">Trojan horse</a> through which the studios began to reassert their power."

The film had broader cultural repercussions, as well. Similar to the way the pivotal scene in 1960's "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>" made showers a new source of anxiety, "Jaws" led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as an increased number of reported shark sightings. It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called ""Jaws" effect", which allegedly inspired "legions of fishermen [who] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments." Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.

"Jaws" set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s 1979 science fiction film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>" was pitched to studio executives as ""Jaws" in space". Many films based on man-eating animals, usually aquatic, were released through the 1970s and 1980s, such as "<a href="Orca%20%28film%29">Orca</a>", "<a href="Grizzly%20%28film%29">Grizzly</a>", "", "<a href="Barracuda%20%281978%20film%29">Barracuda</a>", "<a href="Alligator%20%28film%29">Alligator</a>", "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Animals">Day of the Animals</a>", "<a href="Tintorera">Tintorera</a>", and "<a href="Eaten%20Alive">Eaten Alive</a>". Spielberg declared "<a href="Piranha%20%281978%20film%29">Piranha</a>", directed by <a href="Joe%20Dante">Joe Dante</a> and written by <a href="John%20Sayles">John Sayles</a>, "the best of the "Jaws" ripoffs". Among the various foreign <a href="mockbuster">mockbuster</a>s based on "Jaws", three came from Italy: "<a href="Great%20White%20%28film%29">Great White</a>", which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the "Jaws" franchise; "<a href="Monster%20Shark">Monster Shark</a>", featured in "<a href="Mystery%20Science%20Theater%203000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>" under the title "Devil Fish"; and "<a href="Deep%20Blood">Deep Blood</a>", which blends in a supernatural element. The 2009 Japanese horror film "Psycho Shark" was released in the United States as "<a href="Jaws%20in%20Japan">Jaws in Japan</a>".

Richard Dreyfuss made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film "<a href="Piranha%203D">Piranha 3D</a>", a loose remake of the 1978 film. Dreyfuss plays Matt Boyd, a fisherman who is the first victim of the title creatures. Dreyfuss later stated that his character was a parody and a near-reincarnation of Matt Hooper, his character in "Jaws". During his appearance, Dreyfuss's character listens to the song "<a href="Show%20Me%20the%20Way%20to%20Go%20Home">Show Me the Way to Go Home</a>" on the radio, which Hooper, Quint and Brody sing together aboard the "Orca".

Martha's Vineyard celebrated the film's 30th anniversary in 2005 with a "JawsFest" festival, which had a second edition in 2012. An independent group of fans produced the feature-length documentary "<a href="The%20Shark%20Is%20Still%20Working">The Shark Is Still Working</a>", featuring interviews with the film's cast and crew. Narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley, who died in 2006, it debuted at the 2009 Los Angeles United Film Festival.

The first ever <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> title marketed in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> was the MCA <a href="DiscoVision">DiscoVision</a> release of "Jaws" in 1978. A second LaserDisc was released in 1992, before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video's Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate boxset that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel "Jaws", and a CD of John Williams's soundtrack.

MCA Home Video first released "Jaws" on VHS in 1980. For the film's 20th anniversary in 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collector's Edition tape featuring a making-of retrospective. This release sold 800,000 units in North America. Another, final VHS release, marking the film's 25th anniversary in 2000, came with a companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer.

"Jaws" was first released on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign. It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of the one featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards. The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month. In June 2005, a 30th-anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival on Martha's Vineyard. The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of "Jaws" in 1974. On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> Disc of "Jaws" was released, with over four hours of extras, including "The Shark Is Still Working". The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal's 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold.

"Jaws" spawned three sequels, none of which approached the success of the original. Their combined domestic grosses amount to barely half of the first film's. In October 1975, Spielberg declared to a film festival audience that "making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick". Nonetheless, he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director, <a href="John%20D.%20Hancock">John D. Hancock</a>, was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>", which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible. "<a href="Jaws%202">Jaws 2</a>" (1978) was eventually directed by <a href="Jeannot%20Szwarc">Jeannot Szwarc</a>; Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and <a href="Jeffrey%20Kramer">Jeffrey Kramer</a> all reprised their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels. The next film, "<a href="Jaws%203-D">Jaws 3-D</a>" (1983), was directed by Joe Alves, who had served as art director and production designer, respectively, on the two preceding films. Starring <a href="Dennis%20Quaid">Dennis Quaid</a> and <a href="Louis%20Gossett%20Jr.">Louis Gossett Jr.</a>, it was released in the <a href="3-D%20film">3-D</a> format, although the effect did not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed "Jaws 3". "" (1987), directed by <a href="Joseph%20Sargent">Joseph Sargent</a>, starring <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a>, and featuring the return of Gary, is considered one of the <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20worst">worst movies ever made</a>. While all three sequels made a profit at the box office ("Jaws 2" and "Jaws 3-D" were among the top 20 highest-grossing films of their respective years), critics and audiences alike were largely dissatisfied with the films.

Maximian

Maximian (; c. 250 – c. July 310) was <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> from 286 to 305. He was "<a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Caesar</a>" from 285 to 286, then "<a href="Augustus%20%28title%29">Augustus</a>" from 286 to 305. He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>, whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at <a href="Trier">Trier</a> but spent most of his time on campaign. In late 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the <a href="Bagaudae">Bagaudae</a>. From 285 to 288, he fought against <a href="Germanic%20tribes">Germanic tribes</a> along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> campaign deep into <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a>c territory in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion.

The man he appointed to police the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> shores, <a href="Carausius">Carausius</a>, rebelled in 286, causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius, and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximian's subordinate, <a href="Constantius%20Chlorus">Constantius</a>, campaigned against Carausius' successor, <a href="Allectus">Allectus</a>, while Maximian held the <a href="Limes%20Germanicus">Rhine frontier</a>. The rebel leader was ousted in 296, and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> and <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> incursions in <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>. When these campaigns concluded in 298, he departed for Italy, where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletian's behest, Maximian abdicated on May 1, 305, gave the Augustan office to Constantius, and retired to southern Italy.

In late 306, Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son <a href="Maxentius">Maxentius</a>' rebellion in Italy. In April 307, he attempted to depose his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantius' successor, <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine</a> (Maximian's step-grandson and son-in-law), in Trier. At the Council of <a href="Carnuntum">Carnuntum</a> in November 308, Diocletian and his successor, <a href="Galerius">Galerius</a>, forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310, Maximian attempted to seize Constantine's title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him, and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian killed himself in mid-310 on Constantine's orders. During Constantine's war with Maxentius, Maximian's image was purged from all public places. However, after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius, Maximian's image was rehabilitated, and he was deified.

Maximian was born near <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a> (modern <a href="Sremska%20Mitrovica">Sremska Mitrovica</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>) in the <a href="Roman%20province">province</a> of <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>, around 250 into a family of <a href="shopkeeper">shopkeeper</a>s. Beyond that, the ancient sources contain vague allusions to <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a> as his homeland, to his Pannonian virtues, and to his harsh upbringing along the war-torn <a href="Danube">Danube</a> frontier. Maximian joined the army, serving with Diocletian under the emperors <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> (r. 270–275) and <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius%20Probus">Probus</a> (r. 276–282). He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of <a href="Carus">Carus</a> in 283 and attended Diocletian's election as emperor on November 20, 284 at <a href="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a>. Maximian's swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian <a href="Timothy%20Barnes">Timothy Barnes</a> to mean that the two men were longterm allies, that their respective roles were pre-agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against <a href="Carinus">Carinus</a> (r. 283–285) but there is no direct evidence for this.

With his great energy, firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel, Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourth-century historian <a href="Aurelius%20Victor">Aurelius Victor</a> described Maximian as "a colleague trustworthy in friendship, if somewhat boorish, and of great military talents". Despite his other qualities, Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The <a href="Panegyrici%20Latini">panegyric</a> of 289, after comparing his actions to <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a>' victories over <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> during the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>, suggested that Maximian had never heard of them. His ambitions were purely military; he left politics to Diocletian. The <a href="Christians">Christian</a> <a href="Rhetoric">rhetor</a> <a href="Lactantius">Lactantius</a> suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian's basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes, and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered. Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators' daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust, though Lactantius' credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans.

Maximian had two children with his <a href="Syria">Syria</a>n wife, <a href="Eutropia">Eutropia</a>: <a href="Maxentius">Maxentius</a> and <a href="Fausta">Fausta</a>. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius' birth year have varied from c. 276 to 283, and most date Fausta's birth to c. 289 or 290. <a href="Flavia%20Maximiana%20Theodora">Theodora</a>, the wife of Constantius Chlorus, is often called Maximian's stepdaughter by ancient sources, leading to claims by <a href="Otto%20Seeck">Otto Seeck</a> and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus. Barnes challenges this view, saying that all "stepdaughter" sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history "<a href="Enmannsche%20Kaisergeschichte">Kaisergeschichte</a>", while other, more reliable, sources refer to her as Maximian's natural daughter. Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c. 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus' daughters.

At <a href="Mediolanum">Mediolanum</a> (<a href="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>) in July 285, Diocletian proclaimed Maximian as his co-ruler, or Caesar. The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the Empire, from Gaul to Syria, from Egypt to the lower Danube, Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload. Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.

Next, Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons, just a daughter, Valeria, who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a co-ruler from outside his family and that co-ruler had to be someone he trusted. (The historian <a href="William%20Seston">William Seston</a> has argued that Diocletian, like heirless emperors before him, adopted Maximian as his "filius Augusti" ("Augustan son") upon his appointment to the office. Some agree, but the historian <a href="Frank%20Kolb">Frank Kolb</a> has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence. Maximian did take Diocletian's "<a href="Roman%20naming%20conventions%23Nomen">nomen</a>" (<a href="family%20name">family name</a>) Valerius, however.)

Finally, Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess, both sole-emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power. In contrast, just a few years earlier, the emperor <a href="Carus">Carus</a> and his sons had ruled jointly, albeit not for long. Even the first emperor, <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, (r. 27 BC–AD 14), had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co-emperor had existed from <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> (r. 161–180) on.

The dual system evidently worked well. About 287, the two rulers' relationship was re-defined in religious terms, with Diocletian assuming the title "Iovius" and Maximian "Herculius". The titles were pregnant with symbolism: Diocletian-<a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jove</a> had the dominant role of planning and commanding; Maximian-<a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> the <a href="hero">hero</a>ic role of completing assigned tasks. Yet despite the symbolism, the emperors were not "gods" in the <a href="Imperial%20cult%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Imperial cult</a> (although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics). Instead, they were the gods' instruments, imposing the gods' will on earth. Once the rituals were over, Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East.

The <a href="Bagaudae">Bagaudae</a> of Gaul are obscure figures, appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources, with their 285 uprising being their first appearance. The fourth-century historian <a href="Eutropius%20%28historian%29">Eutropius</a> described them as rural people under the leadership of <a href="Aelianus%20%28rebel%29">Amandus and Aelianus</a>, while Aurelius Victor called them bandits. The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants, seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus (a native of <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>, in what would become southern <a href="France">France</a>): in this case, they would be defecting imperial troops, not brigands. Although poorly equipped, led and trained – and therefore a poor match for Roman legions – Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them. Maximian has been implicated in a massacre of Coptic Christian troops from the headquarters unit of a legion raised in Thebes at Aucanus in modern Switzerland in early 285, during the preparations for the campaign against the Bagaudae.

Maximian traveled to Gaul, engaging the Bagaudae late in mid-285. Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail: the historical sources dwell only on Maximian's virtues and victories. The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency. As the campaign was against the Empire's own citizens, and therefore distasteful, it went unrecorded in <a href="Victory%20title">titles</a> and official <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumphs</a>. Indeed, Maximian's panegyrist declares: "I pass quickly over this episode, for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it." By the end of the year, the revolt had significantly abated, and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier, heralding a period of stability.

Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In late 285, two barbarian armies – one of <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a> and Alamanni, the other of Chaibones and <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a> – forded the Rhine and entered Gaul. The first army was left to die of disease and hunger, while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second. He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns, either at Moguntiacum (<a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>), Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany), or Colonia Agrippina (<a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Germany).

Although most of Gaul was pacified, regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> and <a href="Saxons">Saxon</a> <a href="piracy">piracy</a>. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the <a href="Saxon%20Shore">Saxon Shore</a>, but much remained to be done. For example, there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> during 270–285. In response to the pirate problem, Maximian appointed Mausaeus <a href="Carausius">Carausius</a>, a <a href="Menapii">Menapian</a> from <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a> (southern and western <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders. Carausius fared well, and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.

Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury. Maximian ordered Carausius' arrest and execution, prompting him to flee to Britain. Carausius' support among the British was strong, and at least two British legions (<a href="Legio%20II%20Augusta">II Augusta</a> and XX Valeria Victrix) defected to him, as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne (probably <a href="Legio%20XXX%20Ulpia%20Victrix">XXX Ulpia Victrix</a>). Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.

Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet – he had given it to Carausius – and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks. Meanwhile, Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet, enlisting Frankish mercenaries, and paying his troops well. By late 286, Britain, much of northwestern Gaul, and the entire Channel coast, was under his control. Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state, an "Imperium Britanniarum" and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian, earning the support of British and Gallic merchants. Even Maximian's troops were vulnerable to Carausius' influence and wealth.

Spurred by the crisis with Carausius, on April 1, 286, Maximian took the title of <a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a>. This gave him the same status as Carausius – so the clash was between two Augusti, rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar – and, in Imperial propaganda, Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian's brother, his equal in authority and prestige. Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian's appointment, causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support, and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it. Despite the physical distance between the emperors, Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers, and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.

In theory, the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium. Though divisions did take place – each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences – these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a "patrimonium indivisum". As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: "So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two <a href="Heracleidae">Heracleidae</a>, the <a href="Kings%20of%20Sparta">Spartan Kings</a>, had done." Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors' names, and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire. Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian's province of Africa; Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletian's territory.

Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes. These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius. Although Maximian had many enemies along the river, they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire. Few clear dates survive for Maximian's campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288. 
While receiving the consular "<a href="fasces">fasces</a>" on January 1, 287, Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor, he marched against the barbarians and, although they were not entirely dispersed, he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.

Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a>-<a href="Vosges%20Mountains">Vosges</a> region to be the greatest threat, so he targeted them first. He campaigned using scorched earth tactics, laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni, Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person, riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies weakened from starvation, Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine. He moved deep into Germanic territory, bringing destruction to his enemies' homelands and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms. By the end of 287, he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen. Maximian's panegyrist declared: "All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman."

Early the next year, as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East. The emperors met that year, but neither date nor place is known with certainty. They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.

Later in the year, Maximian led a surprise invasion of the <a href="Agri%20Decumates">Agri Decumates</a> – a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory – while Diocletian invaded Germany via <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a>. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance. They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximian's build-up to proceed without further disturbance. In the aftermath of the war, towns along the Rhine were rebuilt, bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne, and a military frontier was established, comprising forts, roads, and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum (<a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>), Bavacum (<a href="Bavay">Bavay</a>, France), Atuatuca Tungrorum (<a href="Tongeren">Tongeren</a>, Belgium), Mosae Trajectum (<a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>, Netherlands), and Cologne connected points along the frontier.

In early 288, Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect <a href="Constantius%20Chlorus">Constantius Chlorus</a>, husband of Maximian's daughter Theodora, to lead a campaign against Carausius' Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, thwarting sea-attacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory, wreaking havoc, and reaching the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king <a href="Gennobaudes">Gennobaudes</a>. Gennobaudes became Maximian's vassal and, with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes, Roman regional dominance was assured.

Maximian allowed a settlement of <a href="Frisii">Frisii</a>, <a href="Salian%20Franks">Salian Franks</a>, <a href="Chamavi">Chamavi</a> and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory, either between the Rhine and <a href="Waal%20%28river%29">Waal</a> rivers from Noviomagus (<a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, Netherlands) to <a href="Traiectum%20%28Utrecht%29">Traiectum</a>, (Utrecht, Netherlands) or near Trier. These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes, giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region.

By 289, Maximian was prepared to invade <a href="Carausius">Carausius</a>' Britain, but for some reason the plan failed. Maximian's panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign's prospects, but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it. Constantius' panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm, but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat. Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after, perhaps on learning of Maximian's failure. Diocletian returned in haste to the West, reaching Emesa by May 10, 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by July 1, 290.

Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291. Crowds gathered to witness the event, and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry. Potter, among others, has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret, and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors (the <a href="Tetrarchy">Tetrarchy</a>). Meanwhile, a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office. The emperors would not meet again until 303.

Following Maximian's failure to invade in 289, an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius' rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part, Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul. Diocletian, however, would not tolerate this affront to his rule. Faced with Carausius' secession and further challenges on the Egyptian, Syrian, and Danubian borders, he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire. On March 1, 293 at Milan, Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar. On either the same day or a month later, Diocletian did the same for <a href="Galerius">Galerius</a>, thus establishing the "Tetrarchy", or "rule of four". Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.

Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year, Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer, <a href="Allectus">Allectus</a>. Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius' Frankish allies, taking the title "Germanicus maximus". His sights now set on Britain, Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet. Maximian, still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius, was apprised of the invasion plans and, in mid-296, returned to Gaul. There, he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius' Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain. Allectus was killed on the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a> in battle with Constantius' praetorian prefect, <a href="Julius%20Asclepiodotus">Asclepiodotus</a>. Constantius himself had landed near <a href="Dubris">Dubris</a> (Dover) and marched on <a href="Roman%20London">Londinium</a> (<a href="London">London</a>), whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.

With Constantius' victorious return, Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania (<a href="Northwest%20Africa">Northwest Africa</a>). As Roman authority weakened during the third century, nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289, the governor of <a href="Mauretania%20Caesariensis">Mauretania Caesariensis</a> (roughly modern <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and <a href="Quinquegentiani">Quinquegentiani</a>, but the raiders soon returned. In 296, Maximian raised an army, from <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian cohorts</a>, <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a>n, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German <a href="Auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliaries</a>, and <a href="Thracian">Thracian</a> recruits, advancing through Spain later that year. He may have defended the region against raiding <a href="Moors">Moors</a> before crossing the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> into <a href="Mauretania%20Tingitana">Mauretania Tingitana</a> (roughly modern <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>) to protect the area from Frankish pirates.

By March 297, Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy, and Maximian spent the winter of 297–298 resting in <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> before returning to the field. Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> – from which they could continue to wage war – Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable, and the Berbers were skilled at <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes, he devastated previously secure land, killed as many as he could, and drove the remainder back into the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. His campaign was concluded by early 298 and, on March 10, he made a triumphal entry into Carthage. Inscriptions there record the people's gratitude to Maximian, hailing him – as Constantius had been on his entry to London – as "redditor lucis aeternae" ("restorer of the eternal light"). Maximian returned to Italy in early 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome.

After his Mauretanian campaign, Maximian returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius. Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius, and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators, to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several, including the prefect of Rome in 301/2. In contrast, Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 – while Maximian was resting in Italy – continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine.

Maximian was only disturbed from his rest in 303 by Diocletian's "vicennalia", the 20-year anniversary of his reign, in Rome. Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together, passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius. Presumably Maximian's son <a href="Maxentius">Maxentius</a> and Constantius' son <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine</a> – children raised in <a href="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a> together – would then become the new Caesars. While Maximian might not have wished to retire, Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement, Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the <a href="Secular%20Games">Secular Games</a> in 304.

On May 1, 305, in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia, Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go entirely to Maximian's liking: perhaps because of Galerius' influence, Galerius' former army comrade <a href="Flavius%20Valerius%20Severus">Severus</a> and Galerius' nephew <a href="Maximinus%20II">Maximinus</a> (both of whom had long military careers) were appointed Caesar, thus excluding Constantine and Maxentius. Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy, which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held. Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as Caesar, within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son's rebellion against the new regime. Diocletian retired to the expansive <a href="Diocletian%27s%20Palace">palace</a> he had built in his homeland, Dalmatia near Salona on the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>. Maximian retired to villas in <a href="Campania">Campania</a> or <a href="Lucania">Lucania</a>, where he lived a life of ease and luxury. Although far from the political centers of the Empire, Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.

After the death of Constantius on July 25, 306, Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius, who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted. The title of Augustus then went to Severus. Maxentius was jealous of Constantine's power, and on October 28, 306, he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him Augustus. Uncomfortable with sole leadership, Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as "Augustus for the second time", offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.

Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus' soldiers had served under Maximian, and had taken Maxentius' bribes, most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms, which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome, where he was kept as a hostage. In late 307, Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome, and retreated north with his army mostly intact.

While Maxentius built up Rome's defenses, Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximian's younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius' secessionist regime. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and support Maxentius' cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in late 307, at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.

Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–8 but soon fell out with his son and in early 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Rome's sickly government, disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it, and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius' shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius, and Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.

On November 11, 308, to resolve the political instability, Galerius called Diocletian (out of retirement) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube. There, Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar, with Maximinus the Caesar in the east. <a href="Licinius">Licinius</a>, a loyal military companion to Galerius, was appointed Augustus of the West. In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul, the only court that would still accept him. After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of "Sons of the Augusti", they were promoted in early 310, with the result that there were now four Augusti.

In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the <a href="Tyrian%20purple">imperial purple</a>. Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave the city. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia (<a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>). The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.

Despite the earlier rupture in relations, after Maximian's suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father's devoted son. He minted coins bearing his father's deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.

Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a> in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. In addition to the propaganda, Constantine instituted a "<a href="damnatio%20memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a>" on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.

Constantine defeated Maxentius at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Milvian%20Bridge">Battle of the Milvian Bridge</a> on October 28, 312. Maxentius died, and Italy came under Constantine's rule. <a href="Eutropia">Eutropia</a> swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian's son, and Maximian's memory was rehabilitated. His <a href="apotheosis">apotheosis</a> under Maxentius was declared null and void, and he was re-consecrated as a god, probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantine's coinage as "divus", or divine, by 318, together with the deified Constantius and <a href="Claudius%20II">Claudius Gothicus</a>. The three were hailed as Constantine's forebears. They were called "the best of emperors". Through his daughters Fausta and Flavia, Maximian was grandfather or great-grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363.
