Peter Jennings

Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings (July 29, 1938August 7, 2005) was a Canadian-American <a href="journalist">journalist</a> who served as the sole anchor of "<a href="ABC%20World%20News%20Tonight">ABC World News Tonight</a>" from 1983 until his death from <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in 2005. Despite dropping out of high school, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.

Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at the age of nine. He began his professional career with <a href="CJOH-TV">CJOH-TV</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting a teen dance show, "Saturday Date", on Saturdays. In 1965, <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. His inexperience was attacked by critics and others in television news, making for a difficult first stint in the anchor chair. Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>.

He returned as one of "World News Tonight" three anchors in 1978, and was promoted to sole anchor in 1983. Jennings was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 or more hours straight to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> in 1991, the <a href="Millennium%20celebrations">Millennium celebrations</a> in 2000, and the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates">American presidential debates</a>. Jennings was always fascinated with the United States and became a naturalized <a href="citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States citizen</a> in 2003.

Along with <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a> of <a href="NBC">NBC</a> and <a href="Dan%20Rather">Dan Rather</a> of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, Jennings formed part of the "Big Three" <a href="news%20anchors">news anchors</a> who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw in 2004 and Rather in 2005.

Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah were the only two children of Elizabeth (née Osborne) and <a href="Charles%20Jennings%20%28journalist%29">Charles Jennings</a>, a prominent radio broadcaster for the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting "Peter's People", a half-hour, Saturday morning, <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a> show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a>, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.

When Jennings was 11 he began attending <a href="Trinity%20College%20School">Trinity College School</a> in <a href="Port%20Hope%2C%20Ontario">Port Hope</a>, Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved his father to its <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to <a href="Lisgar%20Collegiate%20Institute">Lisgar Collegiate Institute</a>. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of "pure boredom" that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. "I loved girls," he said. "I loved comic books. And for reasons I don't understand, I was pretty lazy." Jennings then briefly attended <a href="Carleton%20University">Carleton University</a>, where he says he "lasted about 10 minutes" before dropping out. He also attended the <a href="University%20of%20Ottawa">University of Ottawa</a>.

Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Canada">Royal Bank of Canada</a>. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its <a href="Havana">Havana</a> branch; instead, it located him to the small town of <a href="Prescott%2C%20Ontario">Prescott</a>, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby <a href="Brockville%2C%20Ontario">Brockville</a> branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the <a href="Orpheus%20Musical%20Theatre%20Society">Orpheus Musical Theatre Society</a>, including "<a href="Damn%20Yankees">Damn Yankees</a>" and "<a href="South%20Pacific%20%28musical%29">South Pacific</a>".

It was in Brockville that the 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, <a href="CFJR-FM">CFJR</a>, a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories, including his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of <a href="CJOH-TV">CJOH-TV</a>, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for "Vue", a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>, and Jennings soon found himself hosting "Club Thirteen", a dance show similar to "<a href="American%20Bandstand">American Bandstand</a>".

The next year, <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a>, Canada's first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> after the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of President John F. Kennedy</a>. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. There, he ran into <a href="Elmer%20Lower">Elmer Lower</a>, then president of <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a>, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. "The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada," Jennings later recalled. "I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?" Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States.

Jennings started reporting for <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> at its New York <a href="news%20bureau">news bureau</a>. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of <a href="NBC">NBC</a> and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of "Peter Jennings With the News", then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced <a href="Ron%20Cochran">Ron Cochran</a>, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. "ABC was in bad shape at the time," Jennings said. "They were willing to try anything, and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me."

An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he – and the upstart ABC News – could not compete with the venerable newscasts of <a href="Walter%20Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> at CBS and <a href="Chet%20Huntley">Chet Huntley</a> and <a href="David%20Brinkley">David Brinkley</a> at NBC. Some in the American audience disliked Jennings' <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian</a> accent. He pronounced lieutenant as "leftenant", mangled the pronunciation of "<a href="Appomattox%20Campaign">Appomattox</a>", and misidentified the "<a href="Marines%27%20Hymn">Marines' Hymn</a>" as "<a href="Anchors%20Aweigh">Anchors Aweigh</a>" at <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>'s presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a "glamorcaster". "It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," he later reflected. "A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified." After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a <a href="foreign%20correspondent">foreign correspondent</a>.

Jennings was determined to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with "Palestine: New State of Mind", a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's "Now" news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of the <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20conflict">Arab–Israeli conflict</a>, including the rise of the <a href="Palestinian%20people">Palestinian</a> <a href="Black%20September%20%28group%29">Black September Organization</a> during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with <a href="Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> chairman <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a>. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist <a href="Hanan%20Ashrawi">Hanan Ashrawi</a>, who was then a graduate student in literature at the <a href="American%20University%20in%20Beirut">American University in Beirut</a>.

In 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the <a href="Munich%20Massacre">Munich Olympics massacre</a> of Israeli athletes by <a href="Black%20September%20Organization">Black September</a>. His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers. He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms "guerillas" and "commandos" instead of "terrorists" to describe the members of Black September.

After events in Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a>, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of "Sadat: Action Biography", a profile of Egyptian president <a href="Anwar%20Sadat">Anwar Sadat</a> that would win him his first of two <a href="George%20Foster%20Peabody%20Award">George Foster Peabody Award</a>s. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That year, Jennings married for the second time, to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.

Jennings returned to the U.S. at the end of 1974 to become <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program "<a href="AM%20America">AM America</a>", a predecessor to "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>". ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested US$8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today</a>". "AM America" debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against "Today", and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the <a href="Ayatollah%20Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, then in exile in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, <a href="Roone%20Arledge">Roone Arledge</a>, were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, which was then known as "ABC Evening News" and whose <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings</a> had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of <a href="Harry%20Reasoner">Harry Reasoner</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a> at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, "<a href="World%20News%20with%20Charles%20Gibson">World News Tonight</a>" debuted with <a href="Frank%20Reynolds">Frank Reynolds</a> in Washington, <a href="Max%20Robinson">Max Robinson</a> in Chicago, and Jennings in <a href="London">London</a>. Jennings' official title was "Foreign Desk Anchor," although he continued to serve as the network's chief foreign correspondent. By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge's previous television coup, "<a href="Wide%20World%20of%20Sports%20%28US%20TV%20series%29">Wide World of Sports</a>", had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC's evening newscast.

Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent <a href="Kati%20Marton">Kati Marton</a>. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings' and Marton's second child, Christopher, was born.

As part of ABC's triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues. His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London gave the impression that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks. Jennings reported on the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a> and subsequent <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">hostage crisis</a>, the assassination of Sadat, the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>, Israel's <a href="1982%20Lebanon%20War">1982 invasion of Lebanon</a>, and <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>'s 1983 visit to Poland. His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as "Jennings' Flying Circus." Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, "<a href="The%20Journal%20%28Canadian%20TV%20show%29">The Journal</a>". The CBC could not meet Jennings' renegotiation deadlines, though, and the deal fell through.

In 1983, Reynolds fell ill with <a href="multiple%20myeloma">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer that often attacks the bones, and was forced to stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>.

On August 9, 1983, ABC announced that Jennings had signed a four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for "World News Tonight" on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the "Big Three" era of Jennings, <a href="Dan%20Rather">Dan Rather</a> of CBS, and <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a> of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of "<a href="NBC%20Nightly%20News">NBC Nightly News</a>" was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," he said. "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake."

Jennings' debut on September 5, 1983, marked the beginning of a steady climb in the ratings for ABC News. He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">1984 presidential campaign season</a>. In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with <a href="David%20Brinkley">David Brinkley</a>. "I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years," Jennings said, "so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right." Jennings and ABC were criticized for suddenly halting coverage of the convention for 30 minutes and airing a rerun of "<a href="Hart%20to%20Hart">Hart to Hart</a>" instead.
Despite a shaky start at the anchor desk, Jennings' broadcast began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">Space Shuttle Challenger disaster</a>, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the <a href="Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">Loma Prieta earthquake</a> struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of <a href="Tom%20Brokaw">Tom Brokaw</a> and <a href="NBC%20News">NBC News</a>. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news of the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. It was "World News Tonight", however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.

Jennings' on-air success continued in 1990, and "World News Tonight" consistently led the ratings race. In January, he anchored the first installment of "<a href="Peter%20Jennings%20Reporting">Peter Jennings Reporting</a>"—hour-long, prime-time ABC News specials dedicated to exploring a single topic. His inaugural program on <a href="Gun%20violence%20in%20the%20United%20States">gun violence in America</a> drew praise. His second installment of "Peter Jennings Reporting" in April, "From the Killing Fields", focused on U.S. policy towards <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>. The program alleged that the federal government was covertly supporting the <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>'s return to power in the Asian nation, a charge that the Bush administration initially denied. On July 18, though, the White House announced that it was ending recognition of the Khmer Rouge.

When the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> started on January 16, 1991, Jennings began a marathon anchoring stint to cover the story, spending 20 of the first 48 hours of the war on-air, and leading ABC News to its highest-ever ratings. After interrupting regular <a href="Saturday%20morning%20cartoon">Saturday morning cartoon</a>s on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing from <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the emotional impact of the war coverage on children. Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, "War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions" the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.

On October 12, 1991, breaking news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings was once again mindful of his audience, prefacing the coverage of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> confirmation hearings for <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> nominee <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> with remarks for children. "You may hear some not very nice language," said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, <a href="Anita%20Hill">Anita Hill</a>, "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together. ... You can ask your parents to tell you more." Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring "Growing Up in the Age of AIDS", a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> in February 1992; and "Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions", a forum on racism in April 1992.

Politics dominated network news in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> presidential candidates in March, and anchored "Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a>?" and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC announced that it would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged <a href="sound%20bite">sound bite</a>s. "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put at least some of the blame on us," Jennings told viewers on "World News Tonight". "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." After <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored "President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions" in February 1993; and "Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America" in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, DC, junior high school which featured <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a> and rapper <a href="MC%20Lyte">MC Lyte</a>.

The early 1990s also served up a series of difficult experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>". The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton was having an affair with "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" columnist <a href="Richard%20Cohen%20%28columnist%29">Richard Cohen</a>. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on "World News Tonight", <a href="Emily%20Rooney">Emily Rooney</a>. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.

With the rise of media watchdog groups, such as the conservative <a href="Media%20Research%20Center">Media Research Center</a> (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias. The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and <a href="Cal%20Thomas">Cal Thomas</a>, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on <a href="Citadel%20Media">ABC Radio</a>, in which he analyzed the results of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20elections%2C%201994">1994 U.S. midterm elections</a>. "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and they can tell you about those <a href="temper%20tantrums">temper tantrums</a>: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," said Jennings. "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week...Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." Despite winning a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>, "Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped", which aired on July 27, 1995 a week before the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>, also drew scorn. Reviewing the show for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", Ken Ringle called it "an ingenue's stroll down the narrow tunnels of academic revisionism" that "purports to discover a post-World War II coverup -- a smoke screen designed to refute any suggestion that the Hiroshima bombing was anything but a military necessity." The conservative <a href="Media%20Research%20Center">Media Research Center</a> called the show "a one-sided version of revisionist history" for suggesting "the U.S. dropped the bomb not to save lives, but to play a cynical Cold War game of intimidating the Soviets." Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.

Jennings pleased some conservatives though, after his three-year lobbying effort to create a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of <a href="Peggy%20Wehmeyer">Peggy Wehmeyer</a> in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored "Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God", a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a "town meeting" segment for <a href="KOMO-TV">KOMO-TV</a> of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. "People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I should go back to Canada," he said. "I hope I don't make that mistake again."
During the mid-1990s, television critics praised Jennings for his insistence on not letting the <a href="O.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Simpson%20murder%20case">O. J. Simpson murder case</a> swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials on the subject and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the <a href="Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">Kennedy School of Government</a> at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the <a href="1995%20Quebec%20referendum">1995 Quebec referendum</a>. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, and he was the only anchor to broadcast from Canada on the eve of the referendum.

Despite these critical successes, in 1996, "World News Tonight" started gradually slipping in the ratings race. Bolstered by strong viewership of its coverage of the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">1996 Summer Olympic Games</a> and heavy coverage of O.J. Simpson's trial, NBC's "Nightly News" overtook the ABC newscast for two weeks in late July and early September. This short bump provided momentum for NBC, which started making steady gains in the ratings. Worried, Jennings and ABC decided to cut back on international reporting and give more air time to "soft stories", in an effort to emulate the success of "Nightly News". The changes provoked a backlash from regular viewers, and ratings plummeted. "We did very badly with it," Jennings said. "The audience kicked us in the teeth." Although changes were made to "World News Tonight" to restore its commitment to major issues and stop the hemorrhaging, "Nightly News" ended 1997 as the number-one evening newscast.

The slide in the ratings coincided with some rockiness at ABC News. The company scrapped plans to develop a cable news channel. On May 29, 1998, <a href="David%20Westin">David Westin</a> succeeded Roone Arledge as president of ABC News. Both denied that the disappointing ratings performance of "World News Tonight" contributed to the decision. A 24-hour strike by the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Broadcast%20Employees%20and%20Technicians">National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians</a> disrupted ABC's coverage of 1998's November elections after talks between the <a href="Trade%20union">union</a> and ABC broke down. Several <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> candidates denied interviews to support the union.

None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake the nightly ratings crown, but "World News Tonight" still offered stiff competition at second place. As the <a href="millennium">millennium</a> approached, Jennings and the network started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former "<a href="Life%20magazine">Life</a>" magazine journalist <a href="Todd%20Brewster">Todd Brewster</a> to pen "<a href="The%20Century%20%28book%29">The Century</a>", a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" Best Seller list</a> in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, "The Century"; production on the monumental project started in 1990, and by the time it aired, it had cost the network US$25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, "", on the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a> in April 1999.

On December 31, 1999, Jennings was on the air for 23 straight hours to anchor "<a href="ABC%202000%20Today">ABC 2000 Today</a>", ABC's massive millennium eve special. An estimated 175 million people tuned into at least a portion of the program. Jennings' American prime-time audience, an estimated 18.6 million viewers, easily outpaced the millennium coverage of rival networks. Television critics praised the program, and described the anchor as "superhuman". Although production costs totaled a hefty $11 million (compared with $2 million each for NBC's and CBS's millennium projects), ABC managed to make a profit of $5 million. The success of the program, though, failed to transfer into any lasting change in the viewership of "World News Tonight"; ABC's evening newscast spent the first week of January as ratings leader, before dropping back to second place.

With another <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">presidential election</a> taking place in 2000, Jennings had some more political reporting duties that year. On January 5, Jennings moderated the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202000">Democratic primary</a> debate, held at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Hampshire">University of New Hampshire</a>. He hosted the primetime news special "The Dark Horizon: India, Pakistan, and the Bomb", which ABC broadcast on March 22, as then-President Clinton began his trip to the region. Jennings was the only American news anchor to travel to India for Clinton's trip. Paul A. Slavin became the new executive producer for "World News Tonight" in April.

Jennings anchored ABC's coverage of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> for 17 straight hours, an effort described as "Herculean" by television critics. Like other network news anchors, he was widely praised for guiding Americans through the disaster. At one point, Jennings broke his composure after receiving phone calls from his children. "We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair," he said, "but...if you're a parent, you've got a kid in some other part of the country, call them up. Exchange observations."

His coverage was not without controversy. Jennings was criticized by <a href="Rush%20Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> among others for commenting about President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> on-air: "Where is the president of the United States? ... I know we don't know where he is, but pretty soon the country needs to know where he is." ABC was flooded with more than 10,000 angry phone calls and e-mails. On September 13, Jennings received more criticism — this time for hosting a forum for Middle East experts that included Palestinian Authority negotiator <a href="Hanan%20Ashrawi">Hanan Ashrawi</a>. In the summer of 2002, Jennings and ABC refused to allow <a href="Toby%20Keith">Toby Keith</a> to open their coverage of July 4 celebrations with "<a href="Courtesy%20of%20the%20Red%2C%20White%20and%20Blue%20%28The%20Angry%20American%29">Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)</a>", prompting criticism from Keith and country music fans, who highlighted the anchor's Canadian citizenship.

The events of September 11 added new meaning to "In Search of America", the project Jennings and Brewster started after the success of their previous collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and "World News Tonight" started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, "50 States/One Nation/One Year". Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, "In Search of America" failed to generate much interest or sales.

Jennings' work on "In Search of America" and the September 11 attacks contributed to his decision in 2003 to become a <a href="Multiple%20citizenship">dual citizen</a> of Canada and the United States. "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," he said. "And when we were working on the America project I spent a lot of time on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" he asked. "It would have been horrendous." The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway."

As he did in 2000, Jennings moderated the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202004">2004 Democratic presidential primary</a> debate, which was held that year at <a href="Saint%20Anselm%20College">Saint Anselm College</a> in <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>. He was noted for questioning General <a href="Wesley%20Clark">Wesley Clark</a> over Clark's silence over controversial comments made by filmmaker <a href="Michael%20Moore">Michael Moore</a>, a supporter of Clark. Moore called then-President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> a "<a href="deserter">deserter</a>".

By late 2004, Brokaw had retired from his anchoring duties at NBC, ceding the reins to <a href="Brian%20Williams">Brian Williams</a>; Rather planned to step down in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an <a href="Upper%20respiratory%20tract%20infection">upper respiratory infection</a> in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">Asian tsunami</a>, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.

In late March, viewers started noticing that Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and unhealthy during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored "World News Tonight" for the last time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the <a href="Funeral%20of%20Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">death and funeral of Pope John Paul II</a>. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on "World News Tonight" that he had been diagnosed with <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>, and was starting <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> treatment the following week. "As some of you now know, I have learned in the last couple of days that I have lung cancer," he said. "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over <a href="9/11">9/11</a>. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.

Throughout the summer, <a href="Charles%20Gibson">Charles Gibson</a>, co-host of "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>", and <a href="Elizabeth%20Vargas">Elizabeth Vargas</a>, co-host of "<a href="20/20%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">20/20</a>", served as temporary anchors. On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com with an update of his status and expressing thanks to those who had offered him their good wishes and prayers. In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional scene in the "World News Tonight" newsroom; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, "for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News." During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill to the point where he could barely speak. He posted another short letter of thanks on July 29, 2005, his 67th birthday.

On August 7, 2005, just after 11:30 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a>, Charles Gibson broke into local news in the eastern U.S. and regular programming on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>. He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a>, <a href="Diane%20Sawyer">Diane Sawyer</a>, and <a href="Ted%20Koppel">Ted Koppel</a>, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the <a href="Breakfast%20television">morning news shows</a>. "Peter, of the three of us, was our prince," said Brokaw on "Today". "He seemed so timeless. He had such élan and style." Canada's television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings' death and had remembrances from their "big three" anchors, <a href="Peter%20Mansbridge">Peter Mansbridge</a> at the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">CBC</a>, <a href="Lloyd%20Robertson">Lloyd Robertson</a> at <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Newman%20%28journalist%29">Kevin Newman</a> (himself a former colleague of Jennings at ABC) at <a href="Global%20Television%20Network">Global</a>.

American President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and Canadian Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Martin">Paul Martin</a> offered statements of condolence to the press.

On August 10, 2005, ABC aired a two-hour special, "Peter Jennings: Reporter", with archival clips of his reports and interviews with colleagues and friends. The special drew more than nine million viewers, and was the most watched television program of the night. For the week of his death, "World News Tonight" placed number one in the ratings race for the first time since June 2004.

Jennings's widow, Kayce Freed, and family held a private service in New York. Jennings was cremated and his ashes split in half. Half of his ashes remained in his home in <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> and the other half was placed in his summer home in the <a href="Gatineau%20Hills">Gatineau Hills</a>, near Ottawa. The <a href="57th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">57th Primetime Emmy Awards</a> on September 18, 2005, included a tribute to Jennings by Brokaw and Rather. A public memorial service for Jennings was held two days later at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. Notable journalists, political leaders, and other friends of Jennings attended. Jennings left a US$50 million estate: half went to Freed, and most of the rest to his son and daughter. On December 5, 2005, after much speculation, and nearly eight months after Jennings stopped anchoring, ABC named Vargas and <a href="Bob%20Woodruff">Bob Woodruff</a> co-anchors for <a href="World%20News%20with%20Diane%20Sawyer">World News Tonight</a>.

In 2007, a book, "Peter Jennings: A Reporter's Life", was published, co-edited by his widow Kayce Freed and his ABC colleague Lynn Sherr. The book contained an oral history compiled from a number of interviews. "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" described the book as "predictably positive" and "reminding readers of the commanding presence Jennings held over broadcast journalism". "Parksville Qualicum News" described it as "browse-able" but with "a few holes left".

Jennings won numerous honors throughout his career, including 16 <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmys</a> and two <a href="Peabody%20Award">George Foster Peabody Awards</a>. His work on "World News Tonight" and "Peter Jennings Reporting" consistently won <a href="Overseas%20Press%20Club">Overseas Press Club</a> and <a href="duPont-Columbia%20Award">duPont-Columbia</a> awards. At the peak of his popularity, Jennings was named "Best Anchor" by the "<a href="Washington%20Journalism%20Review">Washington Journalism Review</a>" in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992. The <a href="Radio%20Television%20Digital%20News%20Association">Radio and Television News Directors Association</a> awarded Jennings its highest honor, the <a href="Paul%20White%20%28journalist%29">Paul White</a> Award in 1995, in recognition of his lifetime contributions to journalism. In 2004, he was awarded with the <a href="Edward%20R.%20Murrow%20Award%20%28Washington%20State%20University%29">Edward R. Murrow Award</a> for Lifetime Achievement in Broadcasting from <a href="Washington%20State%20University">Washington State University</a>.

Just eight days before his death, Jennings was informed that he would be inducted into the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>, the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Canada">nation's highest civilian honor</a>. His daughter, Elizabeth, accepted the insignia on his behalf in October 2005. On February 21, 2006, New York City Mayor <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> designated the block on West 66th Street between <a href="Columbus%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Columbus Avenue</a> and <a href="Central%20Park%20West">Central Park West</a> as "Peter Jennings Way" in honor of the late anchor; the block is home to the ABC News headquarters. In October 2006, <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>, which bought ABC in 1996, posthumously named Jennings a <a href="Disney%20Legends">Disney Legend</a>, the company's highest honor. He was the first ABC News employee so honored. In January 2011, Jennings was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a>' <a href="Television%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Television Hall of Fame</a>.



In 1969–1970, Jennings narrated "<a href="The%20Fabulous%20Sixties">The Fabulous Sixties</a>", a 10-part Canadian <a href="Documentary%20film">television documentary</a> miniseries that first aired on <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a> on October 12, 1969, with the following episodes broadcast as occasional specials into 1970. Each episode covered one year of the 1960s. The series was released on DVD on April 24, 2007, by MPI Home Video.<a href="https%3A//www.amazon.com/dp/B000MGBSLC"></a>


a.Jennings' debut program led with coverage of <a href="Korean%20Air%20Lines%20Flight%20007">Korean Air Lines Flight 007</a>. It also featured stories on the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister <a href="Menachem%20Begin">Menachem Begin</a>, violent clashes in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="labor%20unions">labor unions</a>, and tennis' <a href="1983%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29">U.S. Open</a>.

b.Jennings' performance during the 1984 presidential campaign was analyzed in a 1986 study led by <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> professor Brian Mullen. He concluded that Jennings "exhibited a facial expression bias in favor of Reagan". Mullen's team repeated the study to analyze Jennings' performance in the 1988 presidential election, concluding that the ABC anchor again favored a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate. Television critic <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> also noticed a pro-Reagan bias in Jennings' reporting, referring to ABC as "a news organization that is already considered the White House favorite" in May 1985.

c.ABC News "had its highest evening newscast rating ever the first week in the war, and two nights of its prime-time coverage were among the 10 most-watched shows on television".

d.In 1994, the three major networks devoted 1,592 total minutes to covering the Simpson criminal case; while ABC had 423, CBS had 580 and NBC 589. The Simpson trial was the number-one news story for NBC and CBS in 1995, while at ABC, coverage of the <a href="War%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">War in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> dominated the newscast. Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage. "I'm very pleased that it didn't crowd out as much of the rest of the world on "World News Tonight" as it did on other broadcasts," he said. "I am very pleased it was not our major story of last year as it was at other networks."

e.The immense scope of "<a href="The%20Century">The Century</a>" caused headaches for those developing it. It survived three major changes in narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, all of the people interviewed for their anecdotes of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," he said. "What people care about in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There are people out there who think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I think there is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years."

Kathleen Ferrier

Kathleen Mary Ferrier, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (22 April 19128 October 1953) was an English <a href="contralto">contralto</a> singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> and <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.

The daughter of a <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a <a href="Switchboard%20operator">telephonist</a> with the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">General Post Office</a>. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a> Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with <a href="Roy%20Henderson%20%28baritone%29">Roy Henderson</a>. After the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Ferrier was recruited by the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts</a> (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, who recommended her to the influential <a href="Ibbs%20and%20Tillett">Ibbs and Tillett</a> concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.

In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a> premiere of <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s opera "<a href="The%20Rape%20of%20Lucretia">The Rape of Lucretia</a>". A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a>'s "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>", a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, <a href="John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a>, <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a> and the accompanist <a href="Gerald%20Moore">Gerald Moore</a>. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.

Ferrier was diagnosed with <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954. The <a href="Kathleen%20Ferrier%20Award">Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund</a>, administered by the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.

The Ferrier family originally came from <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a> in <a href="South%20West%20Wales">South West Wales</a>. The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century, when Thomas Ferrier (youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment) settled in the area after being stationed near <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> during a period of industrial unrest. Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912, in the Lancashire village of <a href="Higher%20Walton%2C%20Lancashire">Higher Walton</a> where her father William Ferrier (the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth, née Gorton) was the head of the village school. Although untrained musically, William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs, and his wife Alice (née Murray), whom he married in 1900, was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice. Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple's children, following a sister and a brother; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn, after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul's School in the town. From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist, and had lessons with Frances Walker, a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of <a href="Tobias%20Matthay">Tobias Matthay</a>. Kathleen's talent developed quickly; in 1924 she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the <a href="Lytham%20St%20Annes">Lytham St Annes</a> Festival piano competition, and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place.

Because of William's impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">GPO</a> telephone exchange in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>". Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a <a href="Cramer%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Cramer</a> upright piano as a prize. On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall. After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> studios of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="Percy%20Grainger">Percy Grainger</a>. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.

In 1931, aged 19, Ferrier passed her <a href="LRAM">Licentiate</a> examinations at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> role in a church performance of <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>'s oratorio "<a href="Elijah%20%28oratorio%29">Elijah</a>". However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George's Hall and elsewhere. Early in 1934 she transferred to the <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, to be close to her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson. While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new <a href="Speaking%20clock%23United%20Kingdom">"speaking clock"</a> service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra <a href="Aspiration%20%28phonetics%29">aspirate</a> into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London. Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women. Of Ferrier's career to this point, the music biographer <a href="Humphrey%20Burton">Humphrey Burton</a> wrote: "For more than a decade, when she should have been studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing."

Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, probably through dancing, which they both loved. When she announced that they were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to <a href="Silloth">Silloth</a>, a small port town in <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated. Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.

In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang <a href="Roger%20Quilter">Roger Quilter</a>'s "To Daisies", a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.

After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a <a href="harvest%20festival">harvest festival</a> celebration in the village church at <a href="Aspatria">Aspatria</a>. She was paid one <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a>. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 <a href="Workington">Workington</a> Festival, Ferrier sang "Ma Curly-Headed Babby" in a concert at <a href="Workington%20Opera%20House">Workington Opera House</a>. <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a>, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s song "All Souls' Day", a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, Brahms and <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>.

When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>", under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Council for the Encouragement of the Arts</a> (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> in a performance of "Messiah" together with <a href="Isobel%20Baillie">Isobel Baillie</a>, the distinguished <a href="soprano">soprano</a>. However, her application to the BBC's head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down. Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> after a Hallé concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed to hear her sing, and afterwards recommended her to <a href="Ibbs%20and%20Tillett">Ibbs and Tillett</a>, the London-based concert management agency. John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent's advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942 she moved with her sister Winifred into a flat in Frognal Mansions, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>.

Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, in a lunch-time concert organised by <a href="Myra%20Hess">Dame Myra Hess</a>. Although she wrote "went off very well" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone <a href="Roy%20Henderson%20%28baritone%29">Roy Henderson</a> with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's "Elijah". Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her "warm and spacious tone" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: "one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to "her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character".

On 17 May 1943 Ferrier sang in Handel's "Messiah" at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, alongside Isobel Baillie and <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a>, with <a href="Reginald%20Jacques">Reginald Jacques</a> conducting. According to the critic <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, it was through the quality of her singing here that Ferrier "made her first serious appeal to musicians". Her assured performance led to other important engagements, and to broadcasting work; her increasingly frequent appearances on popular programmes such as "Forces Favourites" and "<a href="Housewives%27%20Choice">Housewives' Choice</a>" soon gave her national recognition. In May 1944, at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">EMI's Abbey Road Studios</a> with <a href="Gerald%20Moore">Gerald Moore</a> as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a> and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a> label; it consisted of two songs by <a href="Maurice%20Greene%20%28composer%29">Maurice Greene</a>, again with Moore accompanying. Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, <a href="Walter%20Legge">Walter Legge</a>, and after a few months she transferred to <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>.

In the remaining wartime months Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar's choral work "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>", her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles. In December she met <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a> while working on another Elgar piece, "<a href="Sea%20Pictures">Sea Pictures</a>"; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates. On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London <a href="The%20Proms">Proms</a>, when she sang "L'Air des Adieux" from <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s opera "<a href="The%20Maid%20of%20Orleans%20%28opera%29">The Maid of Orleans</a>". Although she often sang individual <a href="aria">aria</a>s, opera was not Ferrier's natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Bizet</a>'s "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>" at <a href="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a> in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements. Nevertheless, <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, who had heard her Westminster Abbey "Messiah" performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera "<a href="The%20Rape%20of%20Lucretia">The Rape of Lucretia</a>", which was to open the first postwar <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a> in 1946. She would share the part with <a href="Nancy%20Evans%20%28opera%20singer%29">Nancy Evans</a>. Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was "enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it's the best part one could possibly have".

Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses.
By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: "The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>". She had often sung Orfeo's aria "Che farò" ("What is life") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, <a href="Fritz%20Stiedry">Fritz Stiedry</a>; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.

Ferrier's association with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when <a href="Rudolf%20Bing">Rudolf Bing</a>, the festival's general manager, recommended her to <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a> as the contralto soloist in a performance of <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>'s symphonic song cycle "<a href="Das%20Lied%20von%20der%20Erde">Das Lied von der Erde</a>". This was planned for the 1947 <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Festival">Edinburgh International Festival</a>. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; "I recognised with delight that here potentially was one of the greatest singers of our time", he later wrote. "Das Lied von der Erde" was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the "Edinburgh Evening News" thought it "simply superb". In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, <a href="George%20Lascelles%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Harewood">Lord Harewood</a> described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer's final illness, as "a rare match of music, voice and temperament."

On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> she sang two performances of "Das Lied von der Erde", with Bruno Walter and the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a>. <a href="Alma%20Mahler">Alma Mahler</a>, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: "Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.

During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's "<a href="Alto%20Rhapsody">Alto Rhapsody</a>" at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's <a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor">Mass in B minor</a> at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle "<a href="Kindertotenlieder">Kindertotenlieder</a>". She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of "Orfeo ed Euridice" that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated "this abominable accompanist" who deserved "a kick in the pants". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: "What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.

Shortly after her return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in the world premiere of Britten's "<a href="Spring%20Symphony">Spring Symphony</a>", with <a href="Eduard%20van%20Beinum">Eduard van Beinum</a> and the <a href="Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Concertgebouw Orchestra</a>. Britten had written this work specifically for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented "a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years". A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a> wrote: "Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best".

The following 18 months saw almost uninterrupted activity, encompassing a number of visits to continental Europe and a third American tour between December 1949 and April 1950. This American trip broke new ground for Ferrier—the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>—and included three performances in San Francisco of "Orfeo ed Euridice", with <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a> conducting. At the rehearsals Ferrier met the renowned American contralto <a href="Marian%20Anderson">Marian Anderson</a>, who reportedly said of her English counterpart: "My God, what a voice—and what a face!" On Ferrier's return home the hectic pace continued, with a rapid succession of concerts in Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh followed by a tour of Austria, Switzerland and Italy. In Vienna, the soprano <a href="Elisabeth%20Schwarzkopf">Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</a> was Ferrier's co-soloist in a recorded performance of Bach's Mass in B minor, with the <a href="Vienna%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Vienna Symphony Orchestra</a> under <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>. Schwarzkopf later recalled Ferrier's singing of the "Agnus Dei" from the "Mass" as her highlight of the year.

Early in 1951, while on tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father's death at the age of 83. Although she was upset by this news, she decided to continue with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: "My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke". She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hallé a work that was new to her: <a href="Ernest%20Chausson">Ernest Chausson</a>'s "<a href="Po%C3%A8me%20de%20l%27amour%20et%20de%20la%20mer">Poème de l'amour et de la mer</a>". This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim. Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at <a href="University%20College%20Hospital">University College Hospital</a>, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a <a href="mastectomy">mastectomy</a> was performed on 10 April. All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of "The Rape of Lucretia" by the <a href="English%20Opera%20Group">English Opera Group</a>, scheduled as part of the 1951 <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>.

Ferrier resumed her career on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. She then made her usual visit to the <a href="Holland%20Festival">Holland Festival</a>, where she gave four performances of "Orfeo", and sang in Mahler's <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Mahler%29">Second Symphony</a> with <a href="Otto%20Klemperer">Otto Klemperer</a> and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson's "Poème" with Barbirolli and the Hallé. In November she sang "<a href="Land%20of%20Hope%20and%20Glory">Land of Hope and Glory</a>" at the reopening of Manchester's <a href="Free%20Trade%20Hall">Free Trade Hall</a>, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, "moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears". After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios.

In January 1952 Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a short series of concerts to raise funds for Britten's English Opera Group. Writing later, Britten recalled this tour as "perhaps the loveliest of all" of his artistic associations with Ferrier. Despite continuing health problems, she sang in the "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>" at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, "Messiah" at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and "Das Lied von der Erde" with Barbirolli and the Hallé on 23 and 24 April. On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, and her sister, <a href="Princess%20Margaret%2C%20Countess%20of%20Snowdon">Princess Margaret</a>, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: "Princess M sang—"very" good!". Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of <a href="androgen">androgen</a> injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice. In May she travelled to Vienna to record "Das Lied" and Mahler's "<a href="R%C3%BCckert-Lieder">Rückert-Lieder</a>" with Walter and the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a>; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.

During the remainder of 1952 Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of "Das Lied", "The Dream of Gerontius", "Messiah" and some Brahms songs. She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> and the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> in October. In November, after a <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a> recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing "distracting extra vocal appeals" designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs. However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that "... it's hard to please everybody—for years I've been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer". In December she sang in the BBC's Christmas "Messiah", the last time she would perform this work. On New Year's Day 1953 she was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the Queen's <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">New Year Honours List</a>.

As 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for "Orpheus", an English language version of "Orfeo ed Euridice" to be staged in four performances at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: <a href="Howard%20Ferguson%20%28composer%29">Howard Ferguson</a>, <a href="William%20Wordsworth%20%28composer%29">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Edmund Rubbra</a>. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an <a href="oophorectomy">oophorectomy</a> (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.

The first "Orpheus" performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic's comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage. However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left <a href="femur">femur</a> partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital. This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled. Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier's incapacity; an announcement in "The Guardian" stated: "Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in "Orpheus"".

Ferrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE <a href="investiture">investiture</a>; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since <a href="Muriel%20Foster">Muriel Foster</a> in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a>'s "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>" at the 1953 <a href="Leeds%20Festival%20%28classical%20music%29">Leeds Festival</a>. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a>, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".

The news of Ferrier's death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that "no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). <a href="Ian%20Jack">Ian Jack</a>, editor of "<a href="Granta">Granta</a>", believed that she "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." At a memorial service at <a href="Southwark%20Cathedral">Southwark Cathedral</a> on 14 November 1953 the <a href="Cuthbert%20Bardsley">Bishop of Croydon</a>, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world."

From time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier's career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brangäne in <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s opera "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" at the 1952 <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a>. According to Christiansen she would have been "glorious" in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring cycle</a>". Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: "We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing—contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos". However, she was "a singer of, and for, her time—a time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility". In this context "her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere".

Shortly after Ferrier's death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>'s "<a href="Dido%27s%20Lament">When I am laid in earth</a>", which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo <a href="cor%20anglais">cor anglais</a>. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund <a href="oncology">oncology</a> research.

As the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the <a href="Kathleen%20Ferrier%20Award">Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund</a> was created to encourage young British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year's study to a single prizewinner. With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them <a href="Felicity%20Palmer">Felicity Palmer</a>, <a href="Yvonne%20Kenny">Yvonne Kenny</a>, <a href="Lesley%20Garrett">Lesley Garrett</a> and <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a>. The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer's life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual <a href="bursary">bursaries</a> to students at Britain's major music colleges. In 2012, the Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier's birth and in February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> in the "Britons of Distinction" stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius.

A biographic documentary film, "Kathleen Ferrier", also known as "" was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by <a href="Arte">ARTE France</a> in 2012. It featured interviews with her near relatives, friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts. Kathleen Ferrier Crescent, in <a href="Basildon">Basildon</a>, Essex, is named in her honour.

Ferrier's discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's "Dream of Gerontius", and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Holst</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Bax</a>, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her "<a href="St%20John%20Passion">St John Passion</a>" was captured on disc.

The recording of the <a href="a%20cappella">unaccompanied</a> Northumbrian folk song "Blow the Wind Southerly", initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio in shows such as "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>", "Housewives' Choice" and "<a href="Your%20Hundred%20Best%20Tunes">Your Hundred Best Tunes</a>". Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is "What is Life?" ("Che farò") from "Orfeo ed Euridice". These records sold in large numbers rivalling those of other stars of the time, such as <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> and <a href="Vera%20Lynn">Vera Lynn</a>. In the 21st century Ferrier's recordings still sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year.

On the south coast of the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>, it is north of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and east of <a href="Whitstable">Whitstable</a>. It neighbours the ancient villages of <a href="Herne%2C%20Kent">Herne</a> and <a href="Reculver">Reculver</a> and is part of the <a href="City%20of%20Canterbury">City of Canterbury</a> local government district. Herne Bay's seafront is home to the world's first freestanding purpose-built <a href="Clock%20Tower%2C%20Herne%20Bay">Clock Tower</a>, built in 1837; from the late Victorian period until 1978, the town had the second-longest <a href="Herne%20Bay%20Pier">pier</a> in the United Kingdom.

The town began as a small shipping community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and <a href="Dover">Dover</a>. The town rose to prominence as a <a href="seaside%20resort">seaside resort</a> during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and <a href="promenade">promenade</a> by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and to a lesser degree exposure to flooding that has prevented the town's redevelopment.

The town of Herne Bay took its name from the neighbouring village of <a href="Herne%2C%20Kent">Herne</a>, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English "hyrne", meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The "corner" may relate to the sharp turn in the minor <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> between Canterbury and <a href="Reculver">Reculver</a> at Herne.

One of the oldest buildings in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community that first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London and boats carrying coal ran from <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>. From Herne, there was easy access by road to the city of Canterbury and to Dover, where further passage by boat could then be obtained across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> to France.
The 1801 census recorded Herne Bay, including Herne, as having a population of 1,232. During the early 19th century, a smugglers' gang operated from the town. The gang were regularly involved in a series of fights with the preventive services until finally being overpowered in the 1820s. In the 1830s, a group of London investors, who recognised Herne Bay's potential as a seaside resort, built a wooden <a href="Herne%20Bay%20Pier">pier</a> and a promenade on the town's seafront. This and the subsequent building of a railway station led to the rapid expansion of the town; between 1831 and 1841 the town's population grew from 1,876 to 3,041. The London businessmen intended to rename the town St Augustine's, but the name was unpopular with residents and the name "Herne Bay" remained. In 1833, an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> established Herne Bay and Herne as separate towns. Local landowner Sir Henry Oxenden donated a piece of ground for the site of the town's first church, Christ Church, which was opened in 1834. In 1837, Mrs Ann Thwaytes, a wealthy lady from London, donated around £4,000 to build a clock tower on the town's seafront. It is believed to be the first freestanding, purpose-built clock tower in the world.

During the 1840s, steamboats began running between Herne Bay and London. There was a type of beach boat unique to Herne Bay and nearby <a href="Thanet%20District">Thanet</a>, known as the Thanet <a href="wherry">wherry</a>, a narrow pulling boat about long. These boats were mainly used for fishing; however, with the advent of tourism and the decline of fishing, they became mainly used for pleasure trips. A document dated 1840 records the town as having the following schools, all of which are now defunct: Haddington <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>, Oxenden House, <a href="The%20British%20School">The British School</a>, Prospect Place and Herne Street School. The village of Herne was often called Herne Street around this time. The same document also mentions the still-existing Rodney Head, The Ship and Upper Red Lion inns.

In 1912, the first "Brides in the Bath" murder by <a href="George%20Joseph%20Smith">George Joseph Smith</a> was committed in Herne Bay. BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine for "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". During World War II, a <a href="Maunsell%20Forts">sea-fort</a> was built off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, which is still in existence. The coastal village of Reculver, to the east of Herne Bay, was the site of the testing of the <a href="bouncing%20bomb">bouncing bomb</a> used by the "<a href="The%20Dam%20Busters%20%28film%29">Dam Busters</a>" during the war.

The original wooden pier had to be dismantled in 1871 after its owners went into liquidation and sea worms had damaged the wood. A shorter -long iron pier with a theatre and shops at the entrance was built in 1873. However, it was too short for steamboats to berth at. The pier proved to be unprofitable and in 1896 construction began on a replacement iron pier which would be longer and feature an electric tram. At , this pier was the second longest in the country, behind only the pier at <a href="Southend-on-Sea">Southend-on-Sea</a>.
The town's heyday as a seaside resort was during the late Victorian era; the population nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901. Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion was added to the landward end of the pier. By 1931, the town's population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of World War II, the army cut two gaps between the landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier's two gaps were bridged for pedestrians after the war.

1963 marked the end of steamboat services from the pier. In 1970, a fire destroyed the pier's pavilion and plans were made to replace it with a sports centre, which was opened in 1976 by former Prime Minister <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>. The centre section of the pier was torn down by a storm in 1978, leaving the end of the pier isolated in the sea. It has not been rebuilt due to the cost; however, residents and businesses in the town have campaigned for its restoration. The sports centre was demolished in 2012, leaving a bare platform.

Since 1983, the Member of Parliament for <a href="North%20Thanet">North Thanet</a>, covering northern <a href="Thanet%20District">Thanet</a> and Herne Bay, has been the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Roger%20Gale">Roger Gale</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 general election</a>, he won a majority of 13,528 with 52.7% of the vote in North Thanet. <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> won 21.5% of the vote, <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> 19.4% and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party">United Kingdom Independence Party</a> 6.5%.

Herne Bay, along with Whitstable and Canterbury, is in the <a href="City%20of%20Canterbury">City of Canterbury</a> <a href="Districts%20of%20England">local government district</a>. The town contains the five electoral <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> of Heron, <a href="Herne%20and%20Broomfield">Herne and Broomfield</a>, Greenhill and Eddington, West Bay and Reculver. These wards have thirteen of the fifty seats on the <a href="City%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a> <a href="City%20council">City council</a>. As at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202011">2011 local elections</a>, twelve of those seats were held by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> and one by the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a>.

Herne Bay is in northeast Kent, on the coast of the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>. The town is east of the town of <a href="Whitstable">Whitstable</a> and <a href="Points%20of%20the%20compass">north by east</a> of the city of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. The village of Herne is about to the south, and the village of <a href="Reculver">Reculver</a> is about to the east. The town's suburbs are <a href="Hampton%2C%20Herne%20Bay">Hampton</a>, <a href="Greenhill%2C%20Kent">Greenhill</a> and Studd Hill in the west, <a href="Eddington%2C%20Kent">Eddington</a> and <a href="Broomfield%2C%20Herne%20Bay">Broomfield</a> in the south, and <a href="Beltinge">Beltinge</a> and <a href="Hillborough">Hillborough</a> in the east. The drowned settlement of <a href="Hampton-on-Sea">Hampton-on-Sea</a> once existed beside what is now Hampton.

The landscape of the town has been largely influenced by the Plenty <a href="stream">Brook</a>, which flows northward through the centre of the town and into the sea. It is thought to have been a much larger stream in <a href="Ancient%20history">ancient times</a>. The coastline has two distinct <a href="bay">bay</a>s, separated by a jut of land created by silt from the outflow of the brook into the sea. The first buildings in the town were built along the east bay, a short distance from the brook outflow, where the road from Canterbury met the sea. The town has since spread across both bays, across the Plenty Brook valley and onto the relatively high land flanking both sides of the valley. The land to the east of the valley reaches a height of <a href="Above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a> and to the west reaches . Cliffs are formed where this high land meets the sea.

The rising land beside the coast, between the valley and the eastern cliffs, is known as 'The Downs' (no relation to the <a href="North%20Downs">North</a> or <a href="South%20Downs">South Downs</a>). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> for Birds. The whole of the north east Kent coast has been designated a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. The geology of the town consists mainly of <a href="London%20Clay">London Clay</a>, overlaid with brickearth in the west. The sand and clay of The Downs are subject to <a href="landslip">landslip</a>s.

The Plenty Brook now passes through the town's <a href="Sewage">drainage system</a>, allowing buildings to be built over the top. The brook has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for people living in the Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.

Stormy weather can cause the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused disastrous <a href="flood">flood</a>ing in the town, the worst in the town's history being in 1953. <a href="Coastal%20management">Coastal defences</a> were subsequently constructed including <a href="groyne">groyne</a>s, <a href="sea%20wall">sea wall</a>s and <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle beach</a>. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a>, now known as Neptune's Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.

In <a href="east%20Kent">east Kent</a>, the warmest time of the year is July and August, when maximum temperatures average around 21 °C (70 °F); the coolest months are January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1 °C (34 °F). East Kent's average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2 °C higher than the national average. Herne Bay is sometimes warmer than other parts of <a href="Kent">Kent</a> as it is backed by the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a> to the south. Between 1999 and 2005, Herne Bay recorded the highest daily temperature in the United Kingdom nine times. East Kent's average annual rainfall is about 728 mm (29 inches), the wettest months being October to January. This was lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838 mm (33 inches), and recent droughts have led to <a href="hosepipe%20ban">hosepipe ban</a>s by Mid Kent Water.

As of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 UK census</a>, Herne Bay area <a href="Ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> had a population of 35,188 and a population density of 11.3 persons per hectare.

Of the town's 14,732 households, 48.7% were married couples living together, 8.4% were <a href="Cohabitation">cohabiting</a> couples and 8.3% were lone parents. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 20.5% had someone living alone at pensionable age. 27.7% of households included children aged under 16 or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education. The average household size was 2.74.

The ethnicity of the town was 98.5% white, 0.6% <a href="Multiracial">mixed race</a>, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% black and 0.3% Chinese or other. The place of birth of residents was 96.3% United Kingdom, 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.3% Germany, 0.6% other Western Europe countries, 0.2% Eastern Europe, 0.6% Africa, 0.3% Far East, 0.3% South Asia, 0.2% Middle East, 0.2% North America and 0.2% Oceania. Religion was recorded as 77.3% Christian, 0.3% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Jewish and 0.1% Sikh. 14.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion.

For every 100 females, there were 89.9 males. The age distribution was 6% aged 0–4 years, 14% aged 5–15 years, 4% aged 16–19 years, 29% aged 20–44 years, 25% aged 45–64 years and 22% aged 65 years and over. The town had a high percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%. As a seaside town, Herne Bay is a popular retirement destination; many modern retirement complexes are located near the seafront.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 36% in full-time employment, 13% in <a href="Part%20time">part-time</a> employment, 9% <a href="Self-employment">self-employed</a>, 3% unemployed, 2% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 18% retired, 7% looking after home or family, 6% permanently sick or disabled and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly in line with the national figures, except for the number of people in retirement. This figure nationally was significantly lower at 14%. Of the town's residents aged 16–74, 12% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide. According to <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> estimates, during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the Herne Bay area was £516 (£26,906 per year).

The advent of overseas travel and changes to holiday trends eventually caused the town's economy to decline after the 1960s; regular flooding of the Plenty Brook prevented redevelopment of the town centre. However, extensive seafront regeneration in the 1990s followed the creation of the Neptune's Arm sea defence jetty. The jetty has created a small harbour used by leisure boats and from where tourists can take <a href="Yacht">sailing yacht</a> trips to a seal-watching site in the Thames estuary. The Victorian gardens on the seafront were then able to be fully restored. The <a href="Central%20Bandstand%2C%20Herne%20Bay">Central Bandstand</a>, built in 1924, was refurbished after years of disrepair and closure to the public. A swimming pool and cinema were added to the town centre in the early 1990s. In 2005, a wind-farm with thirty 2.75 MW <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s was built off the coast of Herne Bay and <a href="Whitstable">Whitstable</a>, generating a total of 82.5 MW of electricity. The recent upgrades by the Council have helped improve the image of the town and raise its profile. It is hoped this will attract new investment in tourism and business by the private sector, and lead to the regeneration of the town's economy.

In 2006, Canterbury City Council began a public consultation to discuss the regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, <a href="Parking%20lot">car parks</a> and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier and replacing it with other <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>s.

As of the 2001 census, the industry of employment of residents of Herne Bay was 19% retail, 14% health and <a href="social%20work">social work</a>, 11% manufacturing, 10% construction, 9% real estate, 8% education, 8% transport and communications, 5% <a href="public%20administration">public administration</a>, 5% hotels and restaurants, 4% finance, 1% agriculture and 5% other community, social or <a href="Personal%20Services">Personal Services</a>. Compared to national figures, the town had a relatively high number of workers in the construction and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing and real estate. Many residents commute to work outside the town. As of the 2001 UK census, 14,711 of the town's residents were in employment, whereas there were only 8,104 jobs within the town.

One of the largest employers is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It is one of the major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the <a href="Manufacturing">manufacturing industry</a>, mainly located in <a href="Industrial%20park">industrial estates</a> on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many <a href="Health%20and%20Social%20Care">Health and Social Care</a> jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.

The seafront has a shingle beach, which has been awarded a European Blue Flag and the yellow and blue Seaside Award for its safety and cleanliness. The seafront features a Victorian bandstand and gardens, amusement arcades, and children's play areas. Landmarks by the seafront include the <a href="Clock%20Tower%2C%20Herne%20Bay">Clock Tower</a>, the sea defence jetty, the <a href="Offshore%20construction">off-shore</a> World War II sea fort and the off-shore <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a>. There are seaside cafés, fresh seafood restaurants, guesthouses, beach huts and numerous water-sports facilities.

The Memorial Park, situated near the centre of the town, incorporates a children's play area, a large shallow <a href="duck%20pond">duck pond</a> often used for <a href="remote%20control">remote control</a> boats, basketball and tennis courts and a large expanse of grass for field games. The park has a monument and an 'Avenue of Remembrance' as memorials to the town's residents killed during the two world wars.

<a href="Reculver%20Country%20Park">Reculver Country Park</a> is about east of Herne Bay, and is home to the cliff-top remains of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Reculver">St Mary's Church, Reculver</a>, with its distinctive twin towers, sited within the remains of a <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> fort; a <a href="Visitor%20center">visitor centre</a> offers information on the local geology, history and wildlife. <a href="Wildwood%20Discovery%20Park">Wildwood Discovery Park</a> is about south of Herne Bay on the <a href="A291%20road">A291 road</a> between there and <a href="Sturry">Sturry</a>, and features over 50 species of native British animals, such as deer, badgers, <a href="Boar">wild boar</a> and wolves.

Herne Mill, a late 18th-century Kentish <a href="smock%20mill">smock mill</a> overlooking the village of Herne from a hilltop, is usually open to visitors on Sunday afternoons between April and September. A concrete funnel-shaped <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a> overlooks Herne Bay from the top of Mickleburgh Hill. This water tower is now used as a base for <a href="Transmitter">radio transmitters</a>.

The <a href="A299%20road">A299 road</a>, also known as the Thanet Way, runs between Ramsgate and Faversham via Herne Bay and Whitstable. The road merges with the <a href="M2%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">M2 motorway</a> at Faversham. In the late 1990s, the road was converted into a <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a> and redirected to avoid passing through urban areas of Herne Bay and Whitstable.

Capture of Fort Ticonderoga

The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga occurred during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> on May 10, 1775, when a small force of <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Boys">Green Mountain Boys</a> led by <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> and Colonel <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> surprised and captured the fort's small <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> garrison. The cannons and other armaments were <a href="Noble%20train%20of%20artillery">later transported</a> to <a href="Boston">Boston</a> by Colonel <a href="Henry%20Knox">Henry Knox</a> and used to <a href="Fortification%20of%20Dorchester%20Heights">fortify Dorchester Heights</a> and break the standoff at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">Siege of Boston</a>.

Capture of the fort marked the beginning of offensive action taken by the Americans against the British. After seizing <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Ticonderoga</a>, a small detachment captured the nearby <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Fort Crown Point</a> on May 11. Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men intrepidly raided <a href="Fort%20Saint-Jean%20%28Quebec%29">Fort Saint-Jean</a> on the <a href="Richelieu%20River">Richelieu River</a> in southern <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a>, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. 

Although the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> a staging ground for the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invasion of Quebec</a> later in 1775. It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, artillery from Ticonderoga would be <a href="Noble%20train%20of%20artillery">dragged across Massachusetts</a> to the heights commanding Boston Harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city.

In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga's location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 <a href="Battle%20of%20Carillon">Battle of Carillon</a>, and when the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Ticonderoga%20%281759%29">captured it in 1759</a>. After the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">1763 Treaty of Paris</a>, in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British, the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires, guarding the principal waterway between them. The French had blown up the fort's <a href="magazine%20%28military%29">powder magazine</a> when they abandoned the fort, and it had fallen further into disrepair since then. In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the <a href="26th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">26th Regiment of Foot</a>, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them "invalids" (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well. Because of its former significance, Fort Ticonderoga still had a high reputation as the "gateway to the continent" or the "<a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> of America", but in 1775 it was, according to historian Christopher Ward, "more like a backwoods village than a fort."

Even before shooting started in the American Revolutionary War, <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">American Patriots</a> were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. Within its walls was a collection of heavy <a href="artillery">artillery</a> including <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s, <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s, and <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a>s, armaments that the Americans had in short supply. The fort was situated on the shores of <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, a strategically important route between the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> and the British-controlled <a href="Canada%20under%20British%20Imperial%20Control%20%281764-1867%29">northern provinces</a>. British forces placed there would expose the colonial forces in Boston to attack from the rear. After the war began with the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> on April 19, 1775, the British General <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a> realized the fort would require fortification, and several colonists had the idea of capturing the fort.

Gage, writing from the <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">besieged city of Boston</a> following Lexington and Concord, instructed <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a>'s governor, General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>, to rehabilitate and refortify the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Carleton did not receive this letter until May 19, well after the fort had been captured.

<a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> had frequently traveled through the area around the fort, and was familiar with its condition, manning, and armaments. En route to Boston following news of the events of April 19, he mentioned the fort and its condition to members of <a href="Silas%20Deane">Silas Deane</a>'s militia. The Connecticut <a href="Committee%20of%20Correspondence">Committee of Correspondence</a> acted on this information; money was "borrowed" from the provincial coffers and recruiters were sent into northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Grants">New Hampshire Grants</a> (now <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>) to raise volunteers for an attack on the fort.

<a href="John%20Brown%20of%20Pittsfield">John Brown</a>, an American spy from <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a> who had carried correspondence between revolutionary committees in the Boston area and Patriot supporters in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, was well aware of the fort and its strategic value. <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> and other Patriots in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory also recognized the fort's value, as it played a role in the dispute over that area between New York and New Hampshire. Whether either took or instigated action prior to the Connecticut Colony's recruitment efforts is unclear. Brown had notified the Massachusetts <a href="Committee%20of%20Safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a> in March of his opinion that Ticonderoga "must be seized as soon as possible should hostilities be committed by the King's Troops."

When Arnold arrived outside Boston, he told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannons and other military equipment at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>'s commission and authorized him to command a "secret mission", which was to capture the fort. He was issued £100, some gunpowder, ammunition, and horses, and instructed to recruit up to 400 men, march on the fort, and ship back to Massachusetts anything he thought useful.

Arnold departed immediately after receiving his instructions. He was accompanied by two captains, Eleazer Oswald and Jonathan Brown, who were charged with recruiting the necessary men. Arnold reached the border between Massachusetts and the Grants on May 6, where he learned of the recruitment efforts of the Connecticut Committee, and that Ethan Allen and the <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Boys">Green Mountain Boys</a> were already on their way north. Riding furiously northward (his horse was subsequently destroyed), he reached Allen's headquarters in <a href="Bennington%2C%20Vermont">Bennington</a> the next day. Upon arrival, Arnold was told that Allen was in <a href="Castleton%2C%20Vermont">Castleton</a>, to the north, awaiting supplies and more men. He was also warned that, although Allen's effort had no official sanction, his men were unlikely to serve under anyone else. Leaving early the next day, Arnold arrived in Castleton in time to join a war council, where he made a case to lead the expedition based on his formal authorization to act from the Massachusetts Committee.

The force that Allen had assembled in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut. Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and <a href="Seth%20Warner">Seth Warner</a> as his lieutenants. When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to <a href="Whitehall%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Skenesboro</a> and Asa Douglas to <a href="Panton%2C%20Vermont">Panton</a> with detachments to secure boats. Captain <a href="Noah%20Phelps">Noah Phelps</a>, a member of the "Committee of War for the Expedition against Ticonderoga and <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Crown Point</a>", had reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler seeking a shave. He saw that the fort walls were dilapidated, learned from the garrison commander that the soldiers' gunpowder was wet, and that they expected reinforcements at any time. He reported this intelligence to Allen, following which they planned a dawn raid.

Many of the Green Mountain Boys objected to Arnold's wish to command, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.

By 11:30 pm on May 9, the men had assembled at Hand's Cove (in what is now <a href="Shoreham%2C%20Vermont">Shoreham, Vermont</a>) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. However, boats did not arrive until 1:30 am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force. Eighty-three of the <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Boys">Green Mountain Boys</a> made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest. As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, so they decided to attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint and began confiscating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain. Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, replied, "In the name of the Great <a href="Jehovah">Jehovah</a> and the Continental Congress!" Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with "his breeches in his hand", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.

Nobody was killed in the assault. The only injury was to one American, Gideon Warren, who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet. Eventually, as many as 400 men arrived at the fort, which they plundered for liquor and other provisions. Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder. Frustrated, he retired to the captain's quarters to await forces that he had recruited, reporting to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that Allen and his men were "governing by whim and caprice" at the fort, and that the plan to strip the fort and send armaments to Boston was in peril. When Delaplace protested the seizure of his private liquor stores, Allen issued him a receipt for the stores, which he later submitted to Connecticut for payment. Arnold's disputes with Allen and his unruly men were severe enough that there were times when some of Allen's men drew weapons.

On May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut's Governor <a href="Jonathan%20Trumbull">Jonathan Trumbull</a> with a note saying "I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George the Third</a>." Arnold busied himself over the next few days with cataloging the military equipment at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, a task made difficult by the fact that walls had collapsed on some of the armaments.

Seth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Fort Crown Point</a>, garrisoned by only nine men. It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds. However, Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from "Head Quarters, Crown Point", that he "took possession of this garrison" the day before. It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner's memoir. A small force was also sent to capture <a href="Fort%20George%2C%20New%20York">Fort George</a> on <a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20York%29">Lake George</a>, which was held by only two soldiers.

Troops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing <a href="Philip%20Skene">Philip Skene</a>'s <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Katherine" and several <a href="bateaux">bateaux</a> at Skenesboro. Arnold rechristened the schooner . The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at <a href="Fort%20Saint-Jean%20%28Quebec%29">Fort Saint-Jean</a>, on the <a href="Richelieu%20River">Richelieu River</a> north of the lake. Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. He had "Liberty" outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14. Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats. By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean. The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean. Arnold decided to act immediately.

Rowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort. After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with , a seventy-ton <a href="sloop-of-war">sloop-of-war</a>. Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from <a href="Chambly%2C%20Quebec">Chambly</a>, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the "George", which Arnold renamed the . Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain. This activity was observed by <a href="Moses%20Hazen">Moses Hazen</a>, a retired British officer who lived near the fort. Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20. Major <a href="Charles%20Preston">Charles Preston</a> and 140 men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen's warning.

Fifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold's fleet met Allen's, which was still heading north. After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen's men, who had rowed in open boats without provisions. Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south. Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19, where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback. Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived. In Allen's haste to escape the arriving troops, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.

Ethan Allen and his men eventually drifted away from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point. He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of "Enterprise" because of a lack of knowledgeable seamen. His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga's barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the rubble of the two forts and build <a href="gun%20carriage">gun carriage</a>s for them.

Connecticut sent about 1,000 men under Colonel <a href="Benjamin%20Hinman">Benjamin Hinman</a> to hold Ticonderoga, and New York also began to raise militia to defend Crown Point and Ticonderoga against a possible British attack from the north. When Hinman's troops arrived in June, there was once again a clash over leadership. None of the communications to Arnold from the Massachusetts committee indicated that he was to serve under Hinman; when Hinman attempted to assert authority over Crown Point, Arnold refused to accept it, as Hinman's instructions only included Ticonderoga. The Massachusetts committee eventually sent a delegation to Ticonderoga. When they arrived on June 22 they made it clear to Arnold that he was to serve under Hinman. Arnold, after considering for two days, disbanded his command, resigned his commission, and went home, having spent more than £1,000 of his own money in the effort to capture the fort.
When Congress received news of the events, it drafted a second <a href="Letters%20to%20the%20inhabitants%20of%20Canada">letter to the inhabitants of Quebec</a>, which was sent north in June with James Price, another sympathetic Montreal merchant. This letter, and other communications from the New York Congress, combined with the activities of vocal American supporters, stirred up the Quebec population in the summer of 1775.

When news of the fall of Ticonderoga reached England, <a href="William%20Legge%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Dartmouth">Lord Dartmouth</a> wrote that it was "very unfortunate; very unfortunate indeed".

News of the capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and especially the raids on Fort Saint-Jean, electrified the Quebec population. Colonel Dudley Templer, in charge of the garrison at Montreal, issued a call on May 19 to raise a militia for defense of the city, and requested Indians living nearby to also take up arms. Only 50 men, mostly French-speaking <a href="Seigneurial%20system%20of%20New%20France">landowning seigneurs</a> and <a href="petty%20nobility">petty nobility</a>, were raised in and around Montreal, and they were sent to Saint-Jean; no Indians came to their aid. Templer also prevented merchants sympathetic to the American cause from sending supplies south in response to Allen's letter.

General Carleton, notified by Hazen of the events on May 20, immediately ordered the garrisons of Montreal and <a href="Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res">Trois-Rivières</a> to fortify Saint-Jean. Some troops garrisoned at Quebec were also sent to Saint-Jean. Most of the remaining Quebec troops were dispatched to a variety of other points along the Saint Lawrence, as far west as <a href="Ogdensburg%2C%20New%20York">Oswegatchie</a>, to guard against potential invasion threats. Carleton then traveled to Montreal to oversee the defense of the province from there, leaving the city of Quebec in the hands of Lieutenant Governor <a href="Hector%20Theophilus%20de%20Cramah%C3%A9">Hector Cramahé</a>. Before leaving, Carleton prevailed on Monsignor <a href="Jean-Olivier%20Briand">Jean-Olivier Briand</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Quebec">Bishop of Quebec</a>, to issue his own call to arms in support of the provincial defense, which was circulated primarily in the areas around Montreal and Trois-Rivières.

In July 1775, General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a> began using the fort as the staging ground for the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invasion of Quebec</a> that was launched in late August. In the winter of 1775–1776, <a href="Henry%20Knox">Henry Knox</a> directed the <a href="Noble%20train%20of%20artillery">transportation of the guns</a> of Ticonderoga to <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>. The guns were <a href="Fortification%20of%20Dorchester%20Heights">placed upon Dorchester Heights</a> overlooking the besieged city and the British ships in the harbor, prompting the British to evacuate their troops and <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist supporters</a> from the city in March 1776.

Benedict Arnold again led a fleet of ships at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Valcour%20Island">Battle of Valcour Island</a>, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to recapture the fort in 1776. The British did <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga%20%281777%29">recapture the fort</a> in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga</a>.

Although Fort Ticonderoga was not at the time an important military post, its capture had several important results. Rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and those in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and later <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> were severed, so the British military command made an adjustment to their command structure. This break in communication was highlighted by the fact that Arnold, on his way north to Saint-Jean, intercepted a message from Carleton to Gage, detailing the military troop strengths in Quebec. Command of British forces in North America, previously under a <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20North%20America">single commander</a>, was divided into two commands. General Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec and the northern frontier, while General <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">William Howe</a> was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals <a href="James%20Wolfe">Wolfe</a> and <a href="Jeffery%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amherst">Amherst</a> in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>. In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the <a href="Saratoga%20campaign">Saratoga campaign</a> in 1777, as General Howe apparently abandoned an agreed-upon northern strategy, leaving General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> without southern support in that campaign.

Beginning on the day of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each attempting to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see <a href="%23Further%20reading">Further reading</a>), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. <a href="%23Randall">Randall (1990)</a> claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred. <a href="%23Smith14I">Smith (1907)</a> indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself. There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, "On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [sword] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point."

Eurasian rock pipit

The Eurasian rock pipit ("Anthus petrosus"), or just rock pipit, is a species of small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European <a href="pipit">pipit</a>s. There are three subspecies, of which only the <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a>n form is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> at least in the breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the <a href="Uca%20annulipes">African fiddler crab</a>.

Eurasian rock pipits construct a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16 days to <a href="fledge">fledging</a>. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s picked off the rocks or from shallow water.

The Eurasian rock pipit may be hunted by <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, infested by parasites such as <a href="flea">flea</a>s, or act as an <a href="brood%20parasite">involuntary host</a> to the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

The family <a href="Motacillidae">Motacillidae</a> consists of the <a href="wagtail">wagtail</a>s, <a href="pipit">pipit</a>s and <a href="longclaw">longclaw</a>s. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Anthus", which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s. Their similar appearances have led to <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> problems; the <a href="water%20pipit">water pipit</a> and the <a href="buff-bellied%20pipit">buff-bellied pipit</a> were considered <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the Eurasian rock pipit until they were separated by the <a href="British%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">British Ornithologists' Union</a> in 1998. The Eurasian rock pipit is closely related to the <a href="Meadow%20pipit">meadow</a>, <a href="Red-throated%20pipit">red-throated</a> and <a href="rosy%20pipit">rosy pipit</a>s as well as its former subspecies.

The first formal description naming this species was by English <a href="Natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="George%20Montagu%20%28naturalist%29">George Montagu</a> in 1798. It had previously been described in 1766 by <a href="Thomas%20Pennant">Thomas Pennant</a>, in the first edition of "British Zoology", although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (meadow pipit). It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his "Synopsis of British Birds", in which he called it the sea lark. <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> was the first to give the Eurasian rock pipit a scientific name, "Alauda obscura" in 1790, but the specimen he examined had been misidentified as to the species and was in fact a <a href="dusky%20lark">dusky lark</a>. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, discovered the Eurasian rock pipit on the coast of <a href="Wales">South Wales</a>, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the "rock lark". He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name "Alauda petrosus".

The scientific name of the Eurasian rock pipit is from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. "Anthus" is the name given by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> to a small bird of grasslands, and the specific "petrosus" means "rocky", from "petrus", "rock".

There are three recognised subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit:
"A. p. kleinschmidti" is sometimes merged with the nominate form, "A. p. petrosus". The suggested subspecies "A. p. meinertzhageni" on <a href="South%20Uist">South Uist</a>, "A. p. hesperianus" on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Arran">Isle of Arran</a>, and "A. p. ponens" in northwestern France cannot be reliably separated from the nominate form. There is a geographical trend in appearance, with longer-billed, darker birds at the western end of the range, and shorter-billed, paler individuals in the east.

The Eurasian rock pipit is long and weighs . The nominate race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> are dark brown or blackish, and there is a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance or measurements. Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits.

Compared to the nominate form, "A. p. kleinschmidti" has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts and brighter and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. "A. p. littoralis" may show pinkish underparts and a pale <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but very difficult to assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations are known to be nearly sedentary, so east of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> <a href="Drainage%20basin">basin</a> vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly "littoralis".

Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing <a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.

The Eurasian rock pipit is closely related to the water pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the Eurasian rock pipit is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.

The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling "cheepa" notes followed by a rising series of thin "gee" calls, and finishing with a short <a href="trill%20%28music%29">trill</a>. The shrill "pseep" flight call is intermediate between the soft "sip sip sip" of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin "fist".

The Eurasian rock pipit is almost entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas typically below , although on St Kilda it breeds at up to . The Eurasian rock pipit is not troubled by wind or rain, although it avoids very exposed situations. It may occur further inland in winter or on migration.

The breeding range is <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate</a> and <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> Europe on western and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coasts, with a very small number sometimes nesting in Iceland. The nominate race is largely resident, with only limited movement. "A. p. kleinschmidti", which nests on the Faroe Islands and the Scottish islands, may move to sandy beaches or inland to rivers and lakes in winter. "A. p. littoralis" is largely <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering on coasts from southern Scandinavia to southwest Europe, with a few reaching Morocco. Wanderers have reached <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, but records in Europe away from the coast are rare. For example, a male shot at <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> in 1894, now in the collection of the local <a href="State%20Museum%20of%20Zoology%2C%20Dresden">State Museum of Zoology</a>, is the sole specimen for <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>.

Migratory populations leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning from March onwards, although in the far north they may not arrive before May.

The Eurasian rock pipit is a much more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its relative is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.

The Eurasian rock pipit is highly territorial in the breeding season, and throughout the year where it is resident. Breeding males have a song display in which they fly to above the ground, then circle or descend to the ground with a fluttering "parachute" flight. Territorial males will sometimes enter the territory of an adjacent male to cooperate in evicting an intruder. This behaviour, which requires the ability to distinguish the resident from the intruder, is otherwise only known from the <a href="Uca%20annulipes">African fiddler crab</a>.

Eggs are laid from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in southern Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always close to the shore, in a cliff crevice or hole, or under the cover of vegetation. It is constructed by the female from <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.

The clutch is four to six eggs, glossy pale grey with darker grey or olive speckles mainly at the wider end. They measure and weigh , of which 5% is shell. They are incubated for 14–16 days to hatching, almost entirely by the female, although males have been recorded as occasionally helping. The naked <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks are brooded by the female and <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in about 16 days. Both parents may feed the chicks for several days after fledging. There may be two broods in a year in the south of the pipit's range, and just one further north.

In a British survey, a hatching rate of 82% and a fledging rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, with an average 2.5 surviving young per pair. In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality was nearly 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years.

The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding habitat is rocky <a href="coast">coast</a>s, rather than the damp <a href="grassland">grassland</a> favoured by the water pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit feeds mainly on <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes <a href="Ligia%20oceanica">sea slaters</a> or other species that hide under stones.

Food items include <a href="land%20snail">snails</a>, <a href="Annelid">worms</a>, small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="fly">flies</a> and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s. The proportions of each prey species vary with season and locality. <a href="Amphipoda">Amphipod</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e are important in Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a> "<a href="Assiminea%20grayana">Assiminea grayana</a>" in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the <a href="purple%20sandpiper">purple sandpiper</a> take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.

The Eurasian rock pipit is hunted by <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> including the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>. As with other members of its genus, it is a host of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.
The Eurasian rock pipit is also a host to the <a href="flea">flea</a> "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20borealis">Ceratophyllus borealis</a>", and several other flea species in the <a href="genera">genera</a> "<a href="Ceratophyllus">Ceratophyllus</a>" and "<a href="Dasypsyllus">Dasypsyllus</a>". The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from parasitism of the <a href="common%20periwinkle">common periwinkle</a> "Littorina littoria" by the <a href="Parasitic%20castration">castrating</a> <a href="trematoda">trematode</a> "<a href="Parorchis%20acanthus">Parorchis acanthus</a>". Beaches can become attractive where the decline of the periwinkle results in more ungrazed <a href="alga">alga</a>e, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller "<a href="Littorina">Littorina</a>" snails as food for the pipits.

Estimates of the breeding population of the Eurasian rock pipit vary, but may be as high as 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>.

Breeding densities vary from 0.9–6 pairs/km (1.4–9.7 pairs/mi) of coast depending on the quality of the habitat. There are few threats, although <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s can temporarily reduce the invertebrate population of affected rocky coasts.

Water pipit

The water pipit ("Anthus spinoletta") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird which breeds in the mountains of <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a> and <a href="Southern%20Asia">Southern Asia</a> eastwards to <a href="China">China</a>. It is a short-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>; many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter.

The water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. The head is grey with a broad white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.

Water pipits construct a cup-like nest on the ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14–15 days to <a href="fledge">fledging</a>. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material.

The water pipit may be hunted by <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, infested by parasites such as <a href="flea">flea</a>s, or act as an <a href="brood%20parasite">involuntary host</a> to the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

The family <a href="Motacillidae">Motacillidae</a> consists of the <a href="wagtail">wagtail</a>s, <a href="pipit">pipit</a>s and <a href="longclaw">longclaw</a>s. The largest of the three groups is the pipits in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Anthus", which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s. Their similar appearances have led to <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> problems; the water pipit and the <a href="buff-bellied%20pipit">buff-bellied pipit</a> were both formerly considered <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="Eurasian%20rock%20pipit">Eurasian rock pipit</a>. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the <a href="Meadow%20pipit">meadow</a>, <a href="Red-throated%20pipit">red-throated</a> and <a href="rosy%20pipit">rosy pipit</a>s.

The water pipit was first was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of his "Systema Naturae"</a> in 1758 as "Alauda spinoletta" (characterised as "A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis"). The current genus "Anthus" was created for the pipits by German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Matth%C3%A4us%20Bechstein">Johann Matthäus Bechstein</a> in 1805. "Anthus" is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific "spinoletta" is a local dialect word for a pipit from the <a href="Florence">Florence</a> area of Italy.

There are three recognised subspecies of the water pipit:
A possible fourth race from the northwestern Caucasus, "Anthus spinoletta caucasicus" cannot be reliably separated from "A.s. coutellii". The latter form is itself a potential new species, based on <a href="gene">gene</a>tic data, appearance and a characteristic flight call.

The water pipit is long and weighs . The adult of the nominate race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. The head is grey with a broad white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>. The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks.

The sexes are similar although the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. "A. s. coutellii" is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the white of the outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. "A. s. blakistoni" is large, pale and less strongly streaked.

The water pipit has a complete <a href="moult">moult</a> between July and September, although there is considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult is similar to that of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.

The water pipit is closely related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also typically much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.

The Eurasian rock pipit's subspecies "Anthus petrosus littoralis" in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to the water pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different <a href="Habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitat</a> types even when they occur in the same general area.

The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling "cheepa" notes followed by a rising series of thin "gee" calls, and finishing with a short <a href="trill%20%28music%29">trill</a>. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft "sip sip sip" of the meadow pipit or the shrill "pseep" of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin "fist" flight call is intermediate between the "sip" of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's "feest". The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies "A. s. coutellii" is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.

The breeding range of the water pipit is the mountains of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> islands of Sardinia and Corsica.

The water pipit is predominantly a mountain species in the breeding season, found in <a href="Alpine%20transhumance">alpine pasture</a> and high <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s with short grass and some bushes or rocks. It is typically found close to wetter areas and often on slopes. It breeds between altitude, mostly . It <a href="bird%20migration">migrates</a> relatively short distances in autumn to lower ground, typically wintering on coastal wetlands, <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es, rice fields and similar habitats. Although most birds move to lowlands, some may remain at up to . Nominate "A. s. spinoletta" winters mainly in western and southern Europe and in northwestern Africa; in western Europe some birds show fidelity to the same wintering site, returning each year. Birds in Spain appear only to move lower down the mountains in which they breed. "A.s. coutellii" winters at lower altitudes near its breeding areas and also in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and northeast Africa. "A.s. blakistoni" winters in Pakistan, northwest India and southern China.

Water pipits leave their breeding sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies may start moving south before then. The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May. The water pipit has been recorded as a vagrant in Belarus, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and Latvia, and on islands including the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canaries</a>, Iceland, Malta and <a href="Svalbard">Svalbard</a>.

The water pipit is a much less approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than its relative and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.

The water pipit is mainly <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, although both sexes may deviate from this occasionally. The male has a display flight in which he climbs to , flies in an arc and glides back down, singing throughout. The female constructs a cup nest from grass and leaves which is lined with finer plant material and animal hairs. The nest is hidden in vegetation on the ground, sometimes in a hollow. The normal clutch is four to six eggs laid from the end of April to early July. Eggs are greyish white with darker grey or brownish speckles mainly at the wider end, and they measure and weigh of which 5% is shell.

The eggs are incubated by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty after a few days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.

In a Swiss study of the nominate subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race "A. s. blakistoni" in the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests were more likely to fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.

The water pipit's feeding habitat is damp <a href="grassland">grassland</a>, rather than the rocky <a href="coast">coast</a>s favoured by the Eurasian rock pipit. The water pipit feeds mainly on a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, including <a href="orthoptera">crickets and grasshoppers</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s and <a href="spider">spider</a>s. <a href="Psocoptera">Barkflies</a>, <a href="fly">true flies</a>, <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s and <a href="homoptera">homoptera</a>ns can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. Birds close to <a href="snow%20field">snow field</a>s take insects specialised for that habitat such as the <a href="springtail">springtail</a>s "Isotoma saltans" (the <a href="glacier%20flea">glacier flea</a>) and "I. nivalis", and the <a href="Mecoptera">scorpion fly</a> "Boreus izyemalis".

Birds normally forage alone or in pairs; in bad weather, foraging is more frequent and involves longer flights, and may be concentrated around <a href="marmot">marmot</a> burrow entrances. Prey items average in length and are mainly hunted on foot, although flying insects are occasionally caught in the air. Some plant material is taken, and one study on the border of Czechoslovakia and Poland found that 75% of the diet by volume consisted of <a href="algae">algae</a>, specifically "<a href="Ulothrix">Ulothrix zonata</a>", despite large numbers of insects being available.

In areas with acidic soils, there is less <a href="calcium">calcium</a> available, potentially leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits are more likely to select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in <a href="limestone">limestone</a> terrain.

The water pipit is hunted by <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> including the <a href="Eleonora%27s%20falcon">Eleonora's falcon</a>, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s and snakes. As with other members of its genus, the water pipit is a host of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts.
A new species of <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>, "Proctophyllodes schwerinensis", was discovered on the water pipit, which is also a host to the <a href="flea">flea</a>s "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20borealis">Ceratophyllus borealis</a>" and "<a href="Moorhen%20flea">Dasypsyllus gallinulae</a>". Along with other Motacillidae species, the water pipit is a host of the <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>n parasite "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus anthi</a>".

Estimates of the European breeding population of the water pipit vary widely, but may be as high as two million pairs, which would suggest a global population of tens of millions of individuals spread over . The range is discontinuous due to the mountain habitat this species uses, but the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason the water pipit is evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>.

Breeding densities (in pairs per 10 ha) have been recorded as 2.4 in the <a href="Jura%20Mountains">Jura Mountains</a>, 3.0–3.6 in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and 4.5 in the <a href="Tatra%20Mountains">Tatra Mountains</a> of Poland.

Netley Abbey

Netley Abbey is a ruined <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">late medieval</a> <a href="monastery">monastery</a> in the village of <a href="Netley">Netley</a> near <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England. The abbey was founded in 1239 as a house for monks of the austere <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> order. Despite royal patronage, Netley was never rich, produced no influential scholars nor churchmen, and its nearly 300-year history was quiet. The monks were best known to their neighbours for the generous hospitality they offered to travellers on land and sea.

In 1536, Netley Abbey was seized by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> during the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> and the buildings granted to <a href="William%20Paulet%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">William Paulet</a>, a wealthy <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor</a> politician, who converted them into a mansion. The abbey was used as a <a href="country%20house">country house</a> until the beginning of the eighteenth century, after which it was abandoned and partially demolished for building materials. Subsequently the ruins became a tourist attraction, and provided inspiration to poets and artists of the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> movement. In the early twentieth century the site was given to the nation, and it is now a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, cared for by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>. The extensive remains consist of the church, <a href="cloister">cloister</a> buildings, abbot's house, and fragments of the post-Dissolution mansion. Netley Abbey is one of the best preserved medieval Cistercian monasteries in southern England.

Netley was conceived by the influential <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, who was <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> from 1205 until his death in 1238; the abbey was founded shortly after his death, in 1239. The founder's charter shows the name of the abbey as "the church of St Mary of Edwardstow", or the Latin "Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de loco Sancti Edwardi" although the title of the charter calls it "Letley"; the present name of Netley is most likely derived from this. The abbey was one of a pair of monasteries which the bishop intended as a memorial to himself; the other is <a href="La%20Clart%C3%A9-Dieu">La Clarté-Dieu</a> in <a href="Saint-Paterne-Racan">Saint-Paterne-Racan</a>, <a href="France">France</a>. Des Roches began to purchase the lands for Netley's initial endowment in about 1236, but he died before the project was finished and the foundation was completed by his <a href="executors">executors</a>. According to the Chronicle of <a href="Waverley%20Abbey">Waverley Abbey</a>, the first monks arrived to settle the site on 25 July 1239 from neighbouring <a href="Beaulieu%20Abbey">Beaulieu Abbey</a>, a year after the bishop's death. The fact of its founder prior death before designation of the endowment was complete, put the incipient abbey in a difficult financial situation. It is thought that only after the house was taken under the wing of <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, who became interested in it in the mid-1240s, was progress made on the buildings. The King eventually assumed the role of patron in 1251.

The fruits of royal patronage were demonstrated by the construction of a large church ( long), built in the fashionable French-influenced <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style pioneered by Henry's masons at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The high quality and elaborate nature of the church's decoration, particularly its mouldings and <a href="tracery">tracery</a>, indicate how the machine of royal patronage lead to a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur then considered appropriate to a secular church such as a <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>. Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The <a href="presbytery%20%28architecture%29">sanctuary</a> and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the <a href="nave">nave</a> was completed over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage. The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed "H. DI. GRA REX ANGE" (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> for "Henry by the Grace of God King of the English") shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey's patron. Taking many decades to complete, the church was probably finished between 1290 and 1320. Dating the various parts of the building relies predominantly on stylistic criteria.
The church was <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> in shape, with vaulting and a square <a href="presbytery%20%28architecture%29">sanctuary</a> and a low central tower containing bells. It was <a href="aisle">aisle</a>d throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each <a href="transept">transept</a>. There was no <a href="triforium">triforium</a>, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> of triple <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a>s ran above each <a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bay</a> of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end of the sanctuary, probably built after 1260, had a large window which features an upper <a href="rose%20window">rose</a> and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows were simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle had plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof. The north aisle windows by contrast had richly decorated cusped tracery, reflecting the changes in taste over the long period of construction, and suggesting that this was among the last parts of the church to be finished, probably in the very late thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The west wall of the church also has a large window, the tracery of which was destroyed in a collapse during the eighteenth century. Surviving fragments show that it was built in a "freer and more advanced style" than other parts of the church, and suggest a date around the turn of the fourteenth century.

Internally, the church was subdivided into several areas. The high altar was against the east wall of the sanctuary, flanked by two smaller altars on the side walls. To the west, under the tower, were the monks' <a href="choir%20stalls">choir stalls</a> where they sat during services, and further west was a <a href="pulpitum">pulpitum</a> or <a href="rood%20screen">rood screen</a>, which blocked access to the ritual areas of the church. In the nave, the <a href="lay%20brothers">lay brothers</a> had their own choir stalls and altar for services. The monks of Netley kept up a schedule of services and prayer both day and night following the traditional <a href="canonical%20hours">canonical hours</a>; a staircase in the south transept went up to the monks' dormitory, allowing them to convenient access to the night services. The lay brothers had their own entrance to the church at the west end via a covered gallery from their accommodation.

Unlike other orders of monks who allowed parishioners and visitors admission to the nave, the Cistercians officially reserved their churches solely for the use of the monastic community. Others had to worship in a separate chapel in the abbey grounds close to the main gate. Over time this rule was relaxed to allow pilgrims to visit shrines, as at <a href="Hailes%20Abbey">Hailes Abbey</a> with its relic of the <a href="Blood%20of%20Christ">Holy Blood</a>, and to allow the construction of tombs and <a href="chantries">chantries</a> for patrons and wealthy benefactors of the house, as in the churches of other orders. Excavated sculpture shows that the church at Netley featured a number of elaborate tombs and monuments.

The interior of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed to give the impression of <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome <a href="encaustic%20tile">encaustic tile</a>s featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, Queen <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of Castile</a>, <a href="Richard%2C%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Richard of Cornwall</a> and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the <a href="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a>, monks, monsters and humorous animals.

South of the church stands a <a href="cloister">cloister</a> surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was the heart of the abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s. The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.

The east range, which was started at the same time as the church and probably took about 10 years to build, contained many of the abbey's most important rooms. The vaulted library and <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a> were on the ground floor, adjacent to the church. To the south was the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a>, where the deliberations of the abbey took place and the monks met to transact business and to listen to a daily reading of a chapter of the <a href="Rule%20of%20St%20Benedict">Rule of St Benedict</a>. At Netley this was a magnificent apartment divided into three aisles with vaults springing from four columns; a stone bench ran around the walls for the monks to sit on, and the abbot's throne was in the centre of the east wall. The entrance to the chapter house from the cloister is via an elaborately moulded arched doorway, flanked on each side by a window of similar size. The windows had sills and columns of <a href="Purbeck%20Marble">Purbeck Marble</a>, the whole forming an impressive composition appropriate to the second most important space in the abbey after the church. The windows on either side of the door would have been unglazed, so as to allow representatives of the <a href="laybrother">laybrother</a>s (who were not members of <a href="chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a>) to listen to debates. The chapter house was also the site of some tombs, traditionally those of the abbots of a monastery. When the room was excavated, archaeologists discovered scattered human remains and evidence of graves beneath the medieval floor level, indicating that a number of burials.

The <a href="parlour">parlour</a> lies south, an austere, <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a>ed room little more than a passageway through the building. Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on. South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the lifetime of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks' day room and accommodation for novices, but as time went on it may have been converted into the <a href="misericord">misericord</a> where the monks—initially only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole convent—could eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall. 

The monks' dormitory was on the top floor of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.

Another large building lies crosswise at the south end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own <a href="garderobe">garderobe</a>. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic <a href="Hospital">infirmary</a>—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.

The upper floor of this building was the <a href="reredorter">reredorter</a> or latrine. It is a large room with a door conveniently leading into the monks' dormitory. The stalls were in the south wall and the <a href="effluent">effluent</a> dropped into an underground stream which runs in a vaulted passage underneath the building.

To the west of the reredorter block was the buttery, a room where the monks' wine (some of it direct from the king's cellars at Southampton) and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have revealed fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary.

During the Tudor conversion of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the <a href="warming%20house">warming house</a> where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat to rise to the <a href="refectory">refectory</a> or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house <a href="Fountains%20Abbey">Fountains Abbey</a>, the chamber above the warming house was the <a href="muniment">muniment</a> room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, as well as those of local lords, were kept.

The refectory projected south from the centre of the range, as was usual in Cistercian monasteries. This is now almost completely demolished save for the north wall, although the foundations survive underground and have been excavated. It was a long hall with a dais for the abbot and important guests at the south end. There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks' refectory and to the separate dining hall for the <a href="lay%20brothers">lay brothers</a> on the west side.

The west range at Netley is small and does not run the full length of the west side of the cloister. It is divided in two by the original main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then left empty and converted the lay brothers' quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as <a href="Sawley%20Abbey">Sawley Abbey</a> in Lancashire, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as <a href="Hailes%20Abbey">Hailes Abbey</a> in Gloucestershire, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period.

All the buildings around the cloister were finished in the fourteenth century. There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period aside from the re-vaulting of the south transept of the church at the end of the fifteenth century. It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> (as seen at <a href="Cleeve%20Abbey">Cleeve Abbey</a> in Somerset) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.

A stone building to the east of the main complex is thought to have been the <a href="abbot">abbot</a>'s house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper level was reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.

The central core of the monastery was surrounded by a precinct containing an outer (public) courtyard and an inner (private) courtyard, gardens, barns, guesthouses for travellers, stables, fishponds, the home farm and industrial buildings. The site was defended by a high bank and moat, part of which remains east of the abbey. Entrance was strictly controlled by an outer and inner <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>. A chapel, known as the (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> for "chapel outside the gates") was placed by the outer gatehouse for the use of travellers and the local population. Of the precinct buildings, only the abbot's house, the moat and the fishponds have left visible remains.

Netley's fresh water was supplied by two <a href="Aqueduct%20%28watercourse%29">aqueduct</a>s which ran for several miles east and west of the abbey, up into the areas of modern Southampton and <a href="Eastleigh">Eastleigh</a>. The remains of the eastern aqueduct, now known as Tickleford Gully, can be seen in Wentworth Gardens, Southampton.

Henry III added to the endowment left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost <a href="bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an <a href="administration%20%28business%29">administrator</a>, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.

Nevertheless, Netley remained a much respected institution by its neighbours until the end of its life as a monastery. It was not known for scholarship, wealth, or particular fervour, but it was highly regarded for its generosity to travellers and sailors, and for the devout lives ("by Raporte of good Religious conversation") led by its monks. The abbot was summoned on many occasions to sit in <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> with fellow prelates in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> as one of the <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a>. Surviving reports suggest the abbey had a peaceful and scandal-free domestic life.

It is not a unique case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must have been a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of individual monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.

Current scholarship has identified a single book as having belonged to Netley Abbey; it is now conserved as Arundel Ms. 69 in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, London. The volume has an inscription, added in the 15th century on folio 265v: "Codex iste pertinet ad domum sancte Marie de Netteley" ("This codex (i.e. a book not a scroll) belongs to the house of Saint Mary of Netteley"). The volume itself is a Latin manuscript executed in the 13th century, a copy of <a href="Roger%20of%20Hoveden">Roger of Hoveden</a>'s "Chronica" ("<a href="Chronicle">Chronicle</a>s"). Roger (died c. 1201) was an English historian of the reigns of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> and <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> particularly important for his account of the years 1148-1170. Little is known in detail about his life, but he may have been a priest and was a courtier to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, and accompanied <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a> and served as a local justice in the north of England, and more generally as a negotiator between the crown and various barons and monastic houses.

In 1535 the abbey's income was assessed in the "<a href="Valor%20Ecclesiasticus">Valor Ecclesiasticus</a>," <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>'s general survey of Church finances prior to the plunder, at £160 gross, £100 net, which meant the following year that it came under the terms of the First Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>. At the beginning of the following year, the king's commissioners, Sir James Worsley, John Paulet, George Paulet and William Berners, delivered a report to the government on the monasteries of Hampshire which provides a snapshot of Netley on the eve of the Dissolution. The commissioners noted that Netley was inhabited by seven monks, all of them priests, and the abbey was:
In addition to the monks, Netley was home to 29 servants and officials of the abbey, plus two <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="friar">friar</a>s of the strict Observant part of that order who had been put into the abbot's custody by the king, presumably for opposing his religious policies. The royal officers also found plate and jewels (these were certainly objects for worship, such as reliquaries or crosses) in the treasury worth £43, "ornaments" worth £39, and agricultural produce and animals worth £103. The abbey's debts were moderate at £42.

<a href="Thomas%20Stevens%20%28monk%29">Abbot Thomas Stevens</a> and his seven monks were forced to surrender their house to the king in the summer of 1536. Abbot Thomas Stevens and six of his brethren—the seventh opted to resign and become a secular priest—crossed <a href="Southampton%20Water">Southampton Water</a> to join their mother house of <a href="Beaulieu%20Abbey">Beaulieu</a>. Abbot Stevens was appointed Abbot of Beaulieu in 1536 and administered it for two years until Beaulieu in turn was forced to surrender to the king in April 1538. The monks received <a href="pension">pension</a>s after the fall of Beaulieu; Abbot Thomas ended his days as <a href="treasurer">treasurer</a> of <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>, and died in 1550.

Following the dissolution of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings and some of its estates to Sir <a href="William%20Paulet%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">William Paulet</a>, his <a href="Lord%20Treasurer">Lord Treasurer</a> and subsequently <a href="Marquess%20of%20Winchester">Marquess of Winchester</a>. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable for one of the most important politicians in England. He converted the <a href="nave">nave</a> of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the <a href="long%20gallery">long gallery</a> of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and <a href="refectory">refectory</a> and built a new one with a central turreted <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> to provide the appropriate <a href="Seigneurial%20system%20of%20New%20France">seigneurial</a> emphasis needed for a classic <a href="Tudor%20Style%20architecture">Tudor</a> courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.

His eventual successor <a href="William%20Paulet%2C%204th%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester</a> (c.1560-1629) of Basing House, Hampshire, on encountering financial difficulties, sold Basing and Hound in 1602 to <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hertford">Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford</a> (1539-1621), of <a href="Tottenham%20House">Tottenham House</a> in Wiltshire, who used it as a residence, and died there in 1621. His eventual descendant <a href="William%20Seymour%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset</a> (1652-1671) died aged 19 without progeny when his title passed by law to his <a href="heir%20male">heir male</a> but his <a href="entail">unentailed</a> estates including Netley and Hound, passed top his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of <a href="Thomas%20Bruce%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Ailesbury">Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury</a> (1656-1741), who sold Netley in 1676 to <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester</a> (1629-1700), later <a href="Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a>.

<a href="Theophilus%20Hastings%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon</a>, inhabited the abbey until the close of the seventeenth century.

Around 1700, Netley Abbey came into the hands of Sir Berkeley Lucy (also spelled Sir "Bartlet") who decided in 1704 to demolish the by now unfashionable house in order to sell the materials. Sir Berkeley made an agreement with a Southampton builder, Mr Walter Taylor, to take down the former church. However, during the course of the demolition, the contractor was killed by the fall of <a href="tracery">tracery</a> from the west window of the church and the scheme was halted.
The abbey was subsequently abandoned and allowed to decay. In the 1760s <a href="Thomas%20Dummer">Thomas Dummer</a>, who owned estates in the area, moved the north transept to his estate at <a href="Cranbury%20Park">Cranbury Park</a> near <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> where it can be still be seen as a <a href="folly">folly</a> in the gardens of the house (at ).

By the second half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then partially roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.

In 1922, the abbey was passed into state care by the then owner, <a href="Tankerville%20Chamberlayne">Tankerville Chamberlayne</a>, one time <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">M.P.</a> for <a href="Southampton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Southampton</a>. Conservation and archaeological work on the abbey has continued.

Soon after the abbey had been allowed to fall into ruin, it began to attract the attention of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a> praised the ruins in his letters following a visit with the poet <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>, claiming they were "In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise". In 1764, <a href="George%20Keate">George Keate</a> wrote "The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem", which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains. 
Keate was followed by other romantic poets including <a href="William%20Sotheby">William Sotheby</a> ("Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight", 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 <a href="Richard%20Warner%20%28antiquary%29">Richard Warner</a> wrote a potboiler entitled "Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story" in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of <a href="Richard%20Harris%20Barham">Richard Harris Barham</a>'s "<a href="Ingoldsby%20Legends">Ingoldsby Legends</a>" (1837–1845) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun in one of the vaults and ensuring God's revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, while at the same time showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.

"Netley Abbey, an Operatic Farce", by William Pearce, was first performed in 1794 at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a>. The set of the first production featured an elaborate mockup of the abbey ruins seen in the moonlight.

The earliest surviving depiction of the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows the church of the abbey much as it is today, with the exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.

The visitor today will find the shell of the church and monastic buildings around the cloister plus the <a href="abbot">abbot</a>'s house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot's house still have their vaults intact. Medieval <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> <a href="polychrome">polychrome</a> tiles found on the site can be seen in the sacristy, and Henry III's foundation stone remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of <a href="Netley">Netley</a> and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Ancient Monument</a> protected by law.

During the summer months the abbey is occasionally host to events such as open-air <a href="theatre">theatre</a> and was the site of a <a href="flashmob">flashmob</a> <a href="wedding">wedding</a> on 25 June 2011.

Netley Abbey was closed to the public in June 2018 due to safety concerns. English Heritage has taken the decision after scaffolding set up in the nave for conservation work was found to "fall far short" of expected standards.

Over the years several legends have grown up around the abbey, the best attested of which is that of Walter Taylor, the builder contracted to demolish the church. Legend has it that before starting the work he was warned in a dream that he would be punished if he committed sacrilege by damaging the building. The story is recounted by the eighteenth century <a href="antiquary">antiquary</a> Browne Walters:

Another local legend states that during the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey's treasure was hidden down a secret tunnel with a lone monk to guard it. After many years of searching a treasure hunter called Slown is said to have entered an underground passage he had discovered only to return a few moments later screaming, "In the name of God, block it up," before dropping dead.

The story of the nun walled up in a small room recounted in <a href="Richard%20Barham">Richard Barham</a>'s "<a href="The%20Ingoldsby%20Legends">The Ingoldsby Legends</a>" was a creation of the author and has no basis in fact or genuine folklore, as the author himself admits with a smile in his notes to the poem, attributing his story to one James Harrison:

Pathways into Darkness

Pathways into Darkness is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="adventure%20game">adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a> in 1993, for <a href="Apple%2C%20Inc">Apple</a> <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> personal computers. Players assume the role of a <a href="Special%20Forces">Special Forces</a> soldier who must stop a powerful, godlike being from awakening and destroying the world. Players solve puzzles and defeat enemies to unlock parts of a pyramid where the god sleeps; the game's ending changes depending on player actions.

"Pathways" began as a sequel to Bungie's "", before the developers created an original story. <a href="Jason%20Jones%20%28programmer%29">Jason Jones</a> programmed the game, while his friend Colin Brent developed the environments and creatures. The game features three-dimensional <a href="texture%20mapping">texture mapped</a> graphics and <a href="stereo">stereo</a> sound on supported Macintosh models. "Pathways" was critically acclaimed and won a host of awards; it was also Bungie's first major commercial success and enabled the two-man team of Jason Jones and <a href="Alex%20Seropian">Alex Seropian</a> to move into a Chicago office and begin paying staff.

"Pathways into Darkness" is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> and <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>. The game interface consists of four windows. The primary "World View" shows the player character's first-person perspective. Players move, dodge fire, and use weapons and items using the computer <a href="keyboard%20%28computing%29">keyboard</a>. The "Inventory" window displays items players have acquired. The "Message" window relates events and the in-game time, and the "Player" window displays health and energy information. The in-game clock runs constantly during gameplay, except when in conversation; if the time progresses past the point at which the sleeping god wakes, the player loses the game.

In the game, players fight various monsters as they explore the pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and ammunition left behind by others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb a certain amount of damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Other items provide points that increases the player character's maximum health, or money. Crystals can be used against enemies to freeze, burn, or otherwise harm them.

Through the use of the yellow crystal, players can converse with Previously Living Sentient Beings or "PLSBs". Conversations provide players with puzzle information, strategies for defeating monsters, and story background. Rather than relying on a branching tree of conversation options, players type keywords into a dialogue box. When a certain keyword (typically found in a previous statement by the dead person in question) is entered, the dead person will give a response. The manual gives a starting point by mentioning that all dead people respond to "name" and "death", by giving their name and describing how they died, respectively.

"Pathways" casts the player as a member of a <a href="Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">US Army Special Forces</a> team sent on a mission to the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. On May 5, 1994, a diplomat from the alien Jjaro appeared to the President of the United States and informed him that on May 13, an ancient godlike being sleeping beneath a pyramid would awaken and destroy the Earth. The only way to prevent this catastrophe is to prevent the god from awakening. The eight-man Special Forces team carries a <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>, with the goal of entering the ancient pyramid, descending to the bottom level where the god sleeps, and activating the bomb to stun the god and bury it under tons of rock.

Before the game begins, the player character's parachute fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot hours after the rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish-speaking</a> treasure hunters, and fallen members of a <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.

The game's ending changes depending on whether the player has a <a href="Electric%20beacon">radio beacon</a> to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a <a href="pyrrhic%20victory">pyrrhic victory</a>. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.

"Pathways" was Bungie's fourth title (and third commercial title) after their previous game, "Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete", sold around 2,500 copies. In the summer of 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> when he saw "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>", a <a href="shooter%20game">shooter game</a> with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended "Pathways" to be a straightforward 3D version of "Minotaur", but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers wanted to create a game that did not rely on then-rare networks and <a href="modem">modem</a>s, an issue in marketing "Minotaur". The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.

Work on the game's storyline and levels began in January 1993. Jones recalled that starting from cliché plots they moved towards "very interesting and unique but extremely difficult to understand stories". One of the more complicated stories cast the player as one of a group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. "It was a very interesting plot since your quest wasn't necessarily virtuous, it didn't involve doing good things or saving the world," Jones said. "It was just you were chosen, more or less against your will, to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals." The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.

While Bungie founder <a href="Alex%20Seropian">Alex Seropian</a> handled the business aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, and contributed to the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded "Minotaur", the small staff for "Pathways" was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40 million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in <a href="24-bit%20color">24-bit color</a> using <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a>. Despite the game's advanced graphics, "Pathways" was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30 applications that ran natively on Apple's <a href="PowerMac">PowerMac</a>s on launch day.

By July 1993 the game was behind schedule; only the above-ground portions of the pyramid were complete. Jones put in eighteen-hour days for the month leading up to the <a href="MacWorld%20Expo">MacWorld Expo</a> where the game was to be sold. He finished the game in a relatively bug-free state just before the Expo, and Bungie had 500 shrinkwrapped copies of the game available for sale at MacWorld. Due to the game's difficulty, Bungie published an official hint book.

"Pathways" was a critical success. <a href="Inside%20Mac%20Games">Inside Mac Games</a> reviewer Jon Blum wrote in 1993 that "Pathways" was "one of the best Macintosh games I've ever played". "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" described "Pathways" as "a <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon crawl</a>, pure and simple". While describing the game before obtaining a gun as "tedious" and criticizing the small number of <a href="save%20point">save point</a>s per level, the magazine praised the "simple, elegant and easy to use" user interface and "excellent" graphics and sound. "Computer Gaming World" concluded that while "somewhat weak on actual game play", "Pathways" was "a job worthy of a strong recommendation". "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>"s Steven Levy commented that the gameplay and graphics were extremely smooth. He singled out the creatures for specific praise, likening them to "something that might have come from a brain-merge of <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="Anne%20Rice">Anne Rice</a> and <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>" instead of simple line drawings. Complaints and criticisms of the game included the difficulty level; Blum found some segments too difficult and that it was possible to spend hours playing before realizing that the player had made an irreversible mistake. Jones admitted that the game was harder than he intended. The title received several awards, including Inside Mac Games' "Adventure Game of the Year" and "Macworld"s "Best Role-Playing Game", and was listed on the "<a href="MacUser">MacUser</a>" 100.

"Pathways" sold more than 20,000 copies, beating expectations and making it Bungie's first commercial success. It was the third bestselling Macintosh title of the first half of 1994 after "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Sim%20City%202000">Sim City 2000</a>", with projected seven-figure sales for the year. The game made Bungie enough money that the company was able to move from Seropian's apartment to a dedicated office in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>'s <a href="South%20Side%20%28Chicago%29">South Side</a>. At their new location, the Bungie team expanded and began work on another first-person shooter, "<a href="Marathon%20Trilogy">Marathon</a>". Interviewed by Inside Mac Games, Jones said that he did not believe that there would ever be a sequel to "Pathways". "There's a lot of reasons for that, one of them being that I tend to dislike sequels," he said, "A lot of cool things have happened with the rendering technology since "Pathways" shipped, and it suggests some different products which don't really fit into the "Pathways" world."

Simeon I of Bulgaria

Simeon (also Symeon) I the Great (, transliterated "Simeon I Veliki" ) ruled over <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> from 893 to 927, during the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Simeon's successful campaigns against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Hungary">Magyars</a> and <a href="Principality%20of%20Serbia%20%28early%20medieval%29">Serbs</a> led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion ever, making it the most powerful state in contemporary <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. His reign was also a period of unmatched cultural prosperity and enlightenment later deemed the <a href="Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a> of <a href="Bulgarian%20culture">Bulgarian culture</a>.

During Simeon's rule, Bulgaria spread over a territory between the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. The newly independent <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</a> became the first new <a href="patriarchate">patriarchate</a> besides the <a href="Pentarchy">Pentarchy</a>, and Bulgarian <a href="Glagolitic%20alphabet">Glagolitic</a> and <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a> translations of <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> texts spread all over the <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> world of the time. It was at the <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav Literary School</a> in the 890s that the <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a> was developed. Halfway through his reign, Simeon assumed the title of <a href="Emperor">Emperor</a> ("<a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>"), having prior to that been styled <a href="Prince">Prince</a> ("<a href="Knyaz">Knyaz</a>").
Simeon was born in 864 or 865, as the third son of Knyaz <a href="Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris I</a> of <a href="Krum%20of%20Bulgaria">Krum</a>'s dynasty. As Boris was the ruler who <a href="Christianization%20of%20Bulgaria">Christianized Bulgaria</a> in 865, Simeon was a Christian all his life. Because his eldest brother <a href="Vladimir%20of%20Bulgaria">Vladimir</a> was designated heir to the Bulgarian throne, Boris intended Simeon to become a high-ranking cleric, possibly Bulgarian archbishop, and sent him to the leading <a href="University%20of%20Constantinople">University of Constantinople</a> to receive theological education when he was thirteen or fourteen. He took the name <a href="Simeon">Simeon</a> as a novice in a monastery in Constantinople. During the decade (ca. 878–888) he spent in the Byzantine capital, he received excellent education and studied the rhetoric of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. He also learned fluent <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, to the extent that he was referred to as "the half-Greek" in Byzantine chronicles. He is speculated to have been tutored by <a href="Patriarch%20Photios%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople</a>, but this is not supported by any source.

Around 888, Simeon returned to Bulgaria and settled at the newly established royal monastery of <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a> "at the mouth of the <a href="Kamchiya">Tiča</a>", where, under the guidance of <a href="Naum%20of%20Preslav">Naum of Preslav</a>, he engaged in active translation of important religious works from Greek to Medieval Bulgarian (Currently referred to as Church Slavonic), aided by other students from Constantinople. Meanwhile, Vladimir had succeeded Boris, who had retreated to a monastery, as ruler of Bulgaria. Vladimir attempted to reintroduce <a href="paganism">paganism</a> in the empire and possibly signed an anti-Byzantine pact with <a href="Arnulf%20of%20Carinthia">Arnulf of Carinthia</a>, forcing Boris to re-enter political life. Boris had Vladimir imprisoned and blinded, and then appointed Simeon as the new ruler. This was done at an <a href="Council%20of%20Preslav">assembly in Preslav</a> which also proclaimed Bulgarian as the only language of state and church and moved the Bulgarian capital from <a href="Pliska">Pliska</a> to Preslav, to better cement the recent conversion. It is not known why Boris did not place his second son, Gavril, on the throne, but instead preferred Simeon.

With Simeon on the throne, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Leo%20VI%20the%20Wise">Leo VI the Wise</a>, allegedly acting under pressure from his mistress <a href="Zoe%20Zaoutzaina">Zoe Zaoutzaina</a> and her father <a href="Stylianos%20Zaoutzes">Stylianos Zaoutzes</a>, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The Bulgarians sought protection by Simeon, who in turn complained to Leo. However, the Byzantine emperor ignored his embassy.

Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Bulgarian%20war%20of%20894%E2%80%93896">invaded the Byzantine Empire</a> from the north, meeting with little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> to counter <a href="Arab">Arab</a> invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the <a href="Macedonia%20%28theme%29">theme of Macedonia</a>. The Bulgarians took most of the <a href="Khazars">Khazar</a> mercenary guardsmen prisoners and killed many <a href="archon">archon</a>s, including the army's commander. However, instead of continuing his advance to the Byzantine capital, Simeon quickly withdrew his troops to face a <a href="Magyars">Magyar</a> invasion from the north. These events were later called "the first trade war in <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> <a href="Europe">Europe</a>" by Bulgarian historians.

Unable to effectively respond to the Bulgarian campaign due to the engagement of their forces against the Arabs, the Byzantines convinced the Magyars to attack Bulgaria, promising to transport them across the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> using the <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine navy</a>. Leo VI may have also concluded an agreement with Arnulf to make sure that the <a href="Franks">Franks</a> did not support Simeon against the Magyars. In addition, the talented commander <a href="Nikephoros%20Phokas%20the%20Elder">Nikephoros Phokas</a> was called back from <a href="southern%20Italy">southern Italy</a> to lead a separate army against Bulgaria in 895 with the mere intention to overawe the Bulgarians. Simeon, unaware of the threat from the north, rushed to meet Phokas' forces, but the two armies did not engage in a fight. Instead, the Byzantines offered peace, informing him of both the Byzantine foot and maritime campaign, but intentionally did not notify him of the planned Magyar attack. Simeon did not trust the envoy and, after sending him to prison, ordered the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube closed off with ropes and chains, intending to hold it until he had dealt with Phokas.

Despite the problems they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by <a href="%C3%81rp%C3%A1d">Árpád</a>'s son Liüntika across the Danube, possibly near modern <a href="Gala%C5%A3i">Galaţi</a>, and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at the southern border to prevent a possible attack by Phokas. Simeon's two encounters with the enemy in <a href="Northern%20Dobruja">Northern Dobruja</a> resulted in Magyar victories, forcing him to retreat to <a href="Silistra">Drǎstǎr</a>. After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands, but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895. A complete peace was delayed, as Leo VI required the release of the Byzantine captives from the Trade War.

Having dealt with the pressure from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a>, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy <a href="Leo%20Choirosphaktes">Leo Choirosphaktes</a> in order to delay the release of the captives until after the campaign against the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI's <a href="astrology">astrological</a> abilities.

Using a Magyar invasion in the lands of the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>", Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them completely in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Southern%20Buh">Battle of Southern Buh</a> and making them leave <a href="Etelk%C3%B6z">Etelköz</a> forever and settle in <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>. Following the defeat of the Magyars, Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895.

Claiming that not all prisoners had been released, Simeon once again invaded Byzantium in the summer of 896, heading directly to Constantinople. He was met in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> by a hastily assembled Byzantine army, but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bulgarophygon">Battle of Bulgarophygon</a> (at modern <a href="Babaeski">Babaeski</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>). Arming Arab captives and sending them to fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure, Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople, which they had besieged. The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI's death in 912 and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and <a href="Strandzha">Strandža</a> to the Bulgarian Empire. Meanwhile, Simeon had also imposed his authority over <a href="Principality%20of%20Serbia%20%28medieval%29">Serbia</a> in return for recognizing <a href="Archont%20Petar">Petar Gojniković</a> as their ruler.

Simeon often violated the peace treaty with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade <a href="Leo%20of%20Tripoli">Leo of Tripoli</a> to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it was an easy target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern <a href="Albania">Albania</a> were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.

The death of Leo VI on 11 May 912 and the accession of his infant son <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> under the guidance of Leo's brother <a href="Alexander%20%28emperor%29">Alexander</a>, who expelled Leo's wife Zoe from the palace, constituted a great opportunity for Simeon to attempt another campaign against Constantinople, the conquest of which remained the dream of his life. In the spring of 913, Simeon's envoys, who had arrived in Constantinople to renew the peace of 896, were sent away by Alexander, who refused to pay the annual tribute, urging Simeon to <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Bulgarian%20war%20of%20913%E2%80%93927">prepare for war</a>.

Before Simeon could attack, Alexander died on 6 June 913, leaving the empire in the hands of a regency council headed by <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch</a> <a href="Nicholas%20Mystikos">Nicholas Mystikos</a>. Many residents of Constantinople did not recognize the young emperor and instead supported the pretender Constantine Doukas, which, exacerbated by revolts in southern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and the planned Arab invasion in eastern Anatolia, was all to Simeon's advantage. Nicholas Mystikos tried to discourage Simeon from invading Byzantium in a long series of pleading letters, but the Bulgarian ruler nevertheless attacked in full force in late July or August 913, reaching Constantinople without any serious resistance.

The anarchy in Constantinople had ceased after the murder of the pretender Constantine Doukas, however, and a government had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm. This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations, to the joy of the Byzantines. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the <a href="arrears">arrears</a> of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the <a href="Blachernae%20Palace">Blachernae Palace</a>.

Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe returned to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters. Simeon had to resort to war to achieve his goals. He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured <a href="Edirne">Adrianople</a>. Zoe was quick to send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him, and she managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army. In the following years, Simeon's forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces, around Drač (<a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a>) and Thessaloniki, but did not make a move against Constantinople.

By 917, Simeon was preparing for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them. The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.

In 917, a particularly strong Byzantine army led by <a href="Leo%20Phokas%20the%20Elder">Leo Phokas the Elder</a>, son of <a href="Nikephoros%20Phokas%20the%20Elder">Nikephoros Phokas</a>, invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of <a href="Romanos%20I">Romanos Lekapenos</a>, which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. En route to Mesembria (<a href="Nesebar">Nesebǎr</a>), where they were supposed to be reinforced by troops transported by the navy, Phokas' forces stopped to rest near the river of <a href="Aheloy%20River">Acheloos</a>, not far from the port of Anchialos (<a href="Pomorie">Pomorie</a>). Once informed of the invasion, Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines, and attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Acheloos">Battle of Acheloos</a> of 20 August 917, one of the largest in medieval history, the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders, although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria. Decades later, <a href="Leo%20the%20Deacon">Leo the Deacon</a> would write that "piles of bones can still be seen today at the river Acheloos, where the fleeing army of the Byzantines was then infamously slain".

The planned Pecheneg attack from the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with <a href="Megas%20droungarios%20tou%20ploimou">admiral</a> Lekapenos, who refused to transport them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army. The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a> as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because <a href="Michael%20of%20Zahumlje">Michael of Zahumlje</a>, an ally of Bulgaria, had notified Simeon of their plans.

Simeon's army quickly followed up the victory of Acheloos with another success. The Bulgarians sent to pursuit the remnants of the Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas, who had returned to the capital, at the village of <a href="battle%20of%20Katasyrtai">Katasyrtai</a> in the immediate proximity of Constantinople. The Bulgarian regiments attacked and again defeated the Byzantines, destroying some of their last units before returning to Bulgaria.

Immediately after that campaign, Simeon sought to punish the Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had attempted to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, <a href="Theodore%20Sigritsa">Theodore Sigrica</a> and <a href="Marmais">Marmais</a>, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.

Meanwhile, the Byzantine military failures forced another change of government in Constantinople: the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919, forcing her back into a convent. Romanos betrothed his daughter <a href="Helena%20Lekapene">Helena Lekapene</a> to Constantine and advanced to the rank of co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming the government of the empire, which was largely what Simeon had planned to do.

No longer able to climb to the Byzantine throne by diplomatic means, the infuriated Simeon once again had to wage war to impose his will. Between 920 and 922, Bulgaria increased its pressure on Byzantium, campaigning in the west through <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> reaching the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Corinth">Isthmus of Corinth</a> and in the east in Thrace, reaching and crossing the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> to lay siege on the town of <a href="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a>. Simeon's forces appeared before Constantinople in 921, when they demanded the deposition of Romanos and captured Adrianople, and 922, when they were victorious at <a href="battle%20of%20Pigae">Pigae</a>, burned much of the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a> and seized <a href="Vize">Bizye</a>. In the meantime, the Byzantines attempted to ignite Serbia against Simeon, but he substituted Pavle with Zaharije Pribisavljević, a former refugee at Constantinople that he had captured.

Desperate to conquer Constantinople, Simeon planned a large campaign in 924 and sent envoys to the <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> caliph <a href="Ubayd%20Allah%20al-Mahdi%20Billah">Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah</a>, who possessed a powerful navy which Simeon needed. The caliph agreed and sent his own representatives back with the Bulgarians to arrange the alliance. However, the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>. Romanos offered peace to the Arabs, supplementing this offer with generous gifts, and ruined their union with Bulgaria.

In Serbia, Zaharije was persuaded by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was supported by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order to concentrate on the suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by <a href="%C4%8Caslav%20Klonimirovi%C4%87">Časlav Klonimirović</a> in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and bow to the new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were beheaded. Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.

In the summer of 924, Simeon nevertheless arrived at Constantinople and demanded to see the patriarch and the emperor. He conversed with Romanos on the Golden Horn on 9 September 924 and arranged a truce, according to which Byzantium would pay Bulgaria an annual tax, but would be ceded back some cities on the Black Sea coast. During the interview of the two monarchs, two eagles are said to have met in the skies above and then to have parted, one of them flying over Constantinople and the other heading to Thrace, as a sign of the irreconcilability of the two rulers. In his description of this meeting, <a href="Theophanes%20Continuatus">Theophanes Continuatus</a> mentions that "the two "emperors"... conversed", which may indicate renewed Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial claims.

Most likely after (or possibly at the time of) Patriarch Nicholas' death in 925, Simeon raised the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to a patriarchate. This may be linked to Simeon's diplomatic relations with the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a> between 924 and 926, during which he demanded and received Pope <a href="John%20X">John X</a>'s recognition of his title as "Emperor of the Romans", truly equal to the Byzantine emperor, and possibly the confirmation of a patriarchal dignity for the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

In 926, Simeon's troops under <a href="Alogobotur">Alogobotur</a> invaded Croatia, at the time a Byzantine ally, but were completely defeated by the army of <a href="King%20Tomislav">King Tomislav</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bosnian%20Highlands">Battle of the Bosnian Highlands</a>. Fearing a Bulgarian retribution, Tomislav accepted to abandon his union with Byzantium and make peace on the basis of the "<a href="status%20quo">status quo</a>", negotiated by the papal legate Madalbert. In the last months of his life, Simeon prepared for another conflict with Constantinople despite Romanos' desperate pleas for peace.

On 27 May 927, Simeon died of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> in his palace in Preslav. Byzantine chroniclers tie his death to a legend, according to which Romanos decapitated a statue which was Simeon's inanimate double, and he died at that very hour.

He was succeeded by his son <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Peter I</a>, with George Sursubul, the new emperor's maternal uncle, initially acting as a regent. As part of the peace treaty signed in October 927 and reinforced by Peter's marriage to <a href="Irene%20Lekapene">Maria (Eirene)</a>, Romanos' granddaughter, the existing borders were confirmed, as were the Bulgarian ruler's imperial dignity and the head of the Bulgarian Church's patriarchal status.

During Simeon's reign, Bulgaria reached its cultural apogee, becoming the literary and spiritual centre of <a href="Slavic%20Europe">Slavic Europe</a>. In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It was in the <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav Literary School</a> and <a href="Ohrid%20Literary%20School">Ohrid Literary School</a>, founded under Boris, that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated during the reign of Simeon in the new <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a> which was developed there.

The late 9th and early 10th century constitute the earliest and most productive period of medieval <a href="Bulgarian%20literature">Bulgarian literature</a>. Having spent his early years in Constantinople, Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court, but eliminated its assimilative effect by means of military power and religious autonomy. The disciples of <a href="Cyril%20and%20Methodius">Cyril and Methodius</a>, among whom <a href="Clement%20of%20Ohrid">Clement of Ohrid</a>, <a href="Saint%20Naum">Naum</a> and <a href="Constantine%20of%20Preslav">Constantine of Preslav</a>, continued their educational work in Bulgaria, actively translating Christian texts, such as the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and the works of <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Cyril%20of%20Alexandria">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>, as well as historic chronicles such as these of <a href="John%20Malalas">John Malalas</a> and <a href="George%20Hamartolus">George Hamartolus</a>, to Bulgarian. The reign of Simeon also witnessed the production of a number of original theological and secular works, such as <a href="John%20Exarch">John Exarch</a>'s "Six Days" ("Šestodnev"), Constantine of Preslav's "Alphabetical Prayer" and "Proclamation of the Holy Gospels", and <a href="Chernorizets%20Hrabar">Černorizec Hrabǎr</a>'s "An Account of Letters". Simeon's own contribution to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries, for example in the "Praise to Tsar Simeon" preserved in the "Zlatostruj" collection and "Simeon's Collection", to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum.

Simeon turned the new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a magnificent religious and cultural centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty <a href="Crossed-dome%20church">cross-domed churches</a> and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the <a href="Round%20Church%2C%20Preslav">Golden (or Round) Church</a>, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of <a href="Theodore%20Stratelates">Theodore Stratelates</a> and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.

Simeon was married twice. By his first wife, whose identity is unknown, Simeon had a son called <a href="Mihail%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael</a>. Possibly because his mother was of inferior birth, he was excluded from the succession and sent to a monastery.

By his second wife, the sister of the influential noble George Sursubul, he had three sons: <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Peter</a>, who succeeded as Emperor of Bulgaria in 927 and ruled until 969; Ivan, who unsuccessfully conspired against Peter in 929 and then fled to Byzantium; and Benjamin (Bajan), who, according to <a href="Lombards">Lombard</a> historian <a href="Liutprand%20of%20Cremona">Liutprand of Cremona</a>, "possessed the power to transform himself suddenly into a wolf or other strange animal".

Simeon also had several daughters, including one who was arranged to marry Constantine VII in 913. The marriage was annulled by Constantine's mother Zoe once she had returned to the court.

Tsar Simeon I has remained among the most highly valued Bulgarian historical figures, as indicated by popular vote in the "<a href="Velikite%20Balgari">Velikite Bǎlgari</a>" (a spin-off of "<a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>") television programme, which in February 2007 placed him fourth among the greatest Bulgarians ever. Simeon <a href="List%20of%20people%20known%20as%20The%20Great">the Great</a> has been regularly featured in fiction. Bulgarian national writer <a href="Ivan%20Vazov">Ivan Vazov</a> dedicated a children's patriotic poem to him, "Tsar Simeon", and it was later arranged as a song, "Kray Bosfora šum se vdiga" ("A Clamour Rises by the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>"). An eleven-episode drama series filmed in 1984, "<a href="Zlatniyat%20vek">Zlatniyat vek</a>" ("The Golden Age"), retells the story of Simeon's reign. In the series, the tsar is played by <a href="Marius%20Donkin">Marius Donkin</a>. A <a href="historical%20drama">historical drama</a> play called "Tsar Simeon Veliki — Zlatniyat vek" produced by Stefan Staychev, director of the <a href="Silistra">Silistra</a> Theatre, premiered in December 2006. Ivan Samokovliev stars in the part of Simeon.

The painting, "The Bulgarian Tsar Simeon" is part of the 20-canvas work by <a href="Alfons%20Mucha">Alfons Mucha</a>, "<a href="The%20Slav%20Epic">The Slav Epic</a>".

The last Bulgarian monarch, <a href="Simeon%20Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha</a>, was named after Simeon I. A brand of high-quality grape <a href="rakia">rakija</a>, "Car Simeon Veliki", also bears his name, and an <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> peak on <a href="Livingston%20Island">Livingston Island</a> of the <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a> was named <a href="Simeon%20Peak">Simeon Peak</a> in his honour by the <a href="Antarctic%20Place-names%20Commission">Antarctic Place-names Commission</a>.

Music of the Lesser Antilles

The music of the Lesser Antilles encompasses the <a href="music">music</a> of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antillean</a> music is part of the broader category of <a href="Caribbean%20music">Caribbean music</a>; much of the <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> and <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> is also a part of the <a href="Afro-American%20music">Afro-American music</a>al complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">African slaves</a> brought by European traders and colonizers. The <a href="music%20of%20Africa">African music</a>al elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>n tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from <a href="India">India</a>. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.

The former <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British colonies</a> include <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, whose <a href="calypso%20music">calypso</a> style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the <a href="Big%20Drum">Big Drum</a> dance. The <a href="French%20colonial%20empires">French islands</a> of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular "<a href="zouk">zouk</a>" style and have also had extensive musical contact with the <a href="music%20of%20Haiti">music of Haiti</a>, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The <a href="Dutch%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Dutch colonies</a> of <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a> and <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a> share the <a href="combined%20rhythm">combined rhythm</a> popular style. The islands also share a passion for <a href="kaseko">kaseko</a>, a genre of <a href="music%20of%20Suriname">Surinamese music</a>; Suriname and its neighbors <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a> and <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.

While Lesser Antillean music is very often discussed as a <a href="music%20area">music area</a>, this division is of limited usefulness. The islands of the Lesser Antilles divide musically along linguistic lines, with the most significant overlap coming from <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a> and <a href="Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>, both primarily <a href="Caribbean%20English">Anglophone</a> but strongly influenced by a French colonial past. Because the islands are divided linguistically, the term "Antillean music" is usually used in reference to one such music area. Thus, for example, the "Rough Guide to World Music" features a chapter on "Antillean music", which is entirely about the French Antillean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, with a brief sidebar specifically about the Dutch Antilles.

In the context of Anglophone music, the term "Antillean music" most commonly refers to <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title "Music of the Lesser Antilles" for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.

Nevertheless, Antillean music can be characterized by the prominence of the <a href="Caribbean%20Carnival">Carnival</a> celebration (prominently from <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>), and the importance of calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>'s <a href="Labor%20Day%20Carnival">Labor Day Carnival</a> features music and parades, mas and <a href="steelpan">steel bands</a>; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.

<a href="Calypso%20music">Calypso</a> is most closely associated with the island of <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, but it has spread throughout the Lesser Antilles, and abroad. Similar traditions can be found natively on many of Caribbean islands. Within the Antilles, most of the popular calypso stars have come from <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>; the majority of the exceptions, such as <a href="Arrow%20%28musician%29">Arrow</a> from Montserrat, have come from other Anglophone islands. Music author Peter Manuel has argued that, despite the modern Anglophone focus to calypso-like song forms, their origins lie in the "Afro-French creole culture", and notes that the ancestor of the word "calypso", "cariso", was first used to refer to a Martinican singer.

The calypso song complex is characterized by <a href="satire">satirical</a>, political, risque and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican "<a href="mento">mento</a>" is perhaps the most well-known form of calypso-like music. The island of <a href="Carriacou">Carriacou</a> is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as <a href="canboulay">canboulay</a> feasts, <a href="calinda">calinda</a> songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to <a href="calypso%20tent">calypso tent</a>s on the island. The Antiguan <a href="Benna%20%28genre%29">benna</a> is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.

Annual <a href="Caribbean%20Carnival">Carnival</a> celebrations are an important part of the culture of all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-<a href="Lent">Lent</a>, <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>time or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the <a href="U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> as well as French <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a> and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the <a href="J%27ouvert">J'ouvert</a> tradition, which involves calypso and <a href="Soca%20music">soca</a> band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.

Summer Carnivals include those on <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a>, <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint John</a>, Saint Lucia, Grenada, <a href="Saba">Saba</a>, <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> and Anguilla, the latter two of which are especially known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>, Saint Martin and <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a>; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes <a href="Masquerade%20ceremony">masquerade</a>s and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, <a href="Saint-Barth%C3%A9lemy">Saint-Barthélemy</a>, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas</a> and Guadeloupe.

There are many popular traditions common to the English-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles. <a href="Calypso%20music">Calypso</a>, originally an old folk music–based genre from <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, is popular throughout the islands; other popular traditions, like <a href="soca%20music">soca</a> originally from <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, are also well known throughout the region. <a href="Steelpan">Steel drum</a> ensembles is also found throughout the English-speaking Lesser Antilles (and abroad), especially in Trinidad and Tobago as well as Antigua and Barbuda. The British Antilles also share in certain folk traditions. Eastern Caribbean folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the <a href="Shango">Shango</a> music of Trinidad. Variants of the <a href="Big%20Drum">Big Drum</a> festival occur throughout the <a href="Windward%20Islands">Windward Islands</a>, especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Carnival is an important folk music celebration on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and the rest of the Caribbean.

Calypso is part of a spectrum of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans <a href="Benna%20%28genre%29">benna</a> and <a href="mento">mento</a>, but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso's roots are somewhat unclear, but we know it can be traced to 18th-century <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and other Caribbean islands like <a href="Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the <a href="Masquerade%20ceremony">masquerade</a> song "<a href="lavway">lavway</a>", French Creole "<a href="B%C3%A8l%C3%A8%20%28dance%29">belair</a>" and the <a href="stick%20fighting">stick fighting</a> <a href="chantwell">chantwell</a>. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by <a href="Trinidadian">Trinidadian</a> slaves, including <a href="camboulay">camboulay</a> drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known <a href="calypsonian">calypsonian</a>s like <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun%20%28calypsonian%29">Attila the Hun</a> and <a href="Roaring%20Lion">Roaring Lion</a>. calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, the islands began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called <a href="Soca%20music">soca</a> arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.

Steel drums are a distinctively <a href="Trinidadian">Trinidadian</a> ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by pieces of metal used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.

Though <a href="Trinidadian">Trinidadian</a> popular music is by far the most well-known style of Lesser Antillean music, the other Anglophone islands are home to their own musical traditions. <a href="Carriacou">Carriacou</a> and <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a> are home to Carnival celebrations that feature distinct form of calypso, <a href="canboulay">canboulay</a> feasts, <a href="calinda">calinda</a> stick-fighting songs and the steelband accompanied <a href="jouvert">jouvert</a>, as well as the Big Drum dance, which is also found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share other musics as well including the funereal music of the <a href="saraca">saraca</a> rite, a <a href="call-and-response">call-and-response</a> form with both European and African lyrics.

French Creole music is most famously associated with <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, though the islands of <a href="Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a> and <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a> are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music is characterized by the prominence of the <a href="quadrille">quadrille</a> dance, distinct from the French version and related to the <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>an "<a href="M%C3%A9ringue">mereng</a>". The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.

Martinique and Guadeloupe are also home to their own distinct folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan "<a href="gwo%20ka">gwo ka</a>" and Martinican "<a href="tambour">tambour</a>" and "<a href="tibwa">tibwa</a>". "Gwo ka" is a type of percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into "<a href="gwo%20ka%20moderne">gwo ka moderne</a>", though traditional rural performances ("<a href="lewoz">lewoz</a>") are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including "<a href="chouval%20bwa">chouval bwa</a>" and "<a href="biguine">biguine</a>", and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>, <a href="Cuatro%20%28instrument%29">cuatro</a>, <a href="banjo">banjo</a>, <a href="guitar">guitar</a> and <a href="Shak-shak">chak-chak</a> (a <a href="Rattle%20%28percussion%20instrument%29">rattle</a>), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called "<a href="jw%C3%A9">jwé</a>". The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called "<a href="jing%20ping">jing ping</a>". Folk <a href="storytelling">storytelling</a> ("kont") and songs ("bélé") are also a major part of the country's musical identity.

In the 1970s, a wave of <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>an, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (<a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> and <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>) brought with them the <a href="Cadence%20rampa">kadans</a>, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from <a href="mini-jazz">mini-jazz</a> artists like <a href="Les%20Gentlemen">Les Gentlemen</a>, <a href="Les%20Leopards">Les Leopards</a>, and <a href="Les%20Vikings%20de%20Guadeloupe">Les Vikings de Guadeloupe</a>.

Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called <a href="cadence-lypso">cadence-lypso</a>. <a href="Gordon%20Henderson%20%28musician%29">Gordon Henderson</a>'s <a href="Exile%20One">Exile One</a> innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with full-<a href="horn%20section">horn section</a>s and keyboard <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, paving the way for the success of large groups like <a href="Grammacks">Grammacks</a>, <a href="Experience%207">Experience 7</a>, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup <a href="Kassav%27">Kassav'</a> invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like "Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni". Kassav' formed from Paris in 1978.

Cadence-lypso is the Dominican kadans of the 1970s. The leading figure in the promotion of the Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group <a href="Exile%20One">Exile One</a> (based on the island of <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>) and <a href="Grammacks">Grammacks</a> that featured the Haitian Cadence rampa or <a href="compas">compas</a> with the Trinidadian <a href="calypso%20music">calypso</a>, hence the name cadence-lypso; however, most of the bands repertoire was kadans

This fusion of kadans and calypso accounts only for a small percentage of the band's repertoire: Exile One like all Dominica kadans bands featured reggae, calypso and mostly kadans or <a href="compas">compas</a> music.

The Dominican kadans has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/<a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin rhythms</a>, as well as <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> guitars, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>-style vocals and <a href="funk">funk</a> bass and horn styles - music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, <a href="Gordon%20Henderson%20%28musician%29">Gordon Henderson</a> defined Cadence-lypso as "a <a href="%3Awikt%3Asynthesis">synthesis</a> of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary". It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.
Exile One, based in Guadeloupe, is a leading Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very influential in the development of caribbean music. The full-<a href="horn%20section">horn section</a> kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>, Haiti (<a href="mini-jazz">mini-jazz</a>) and the <a href="French%20Antilles">French Antilles</a> emulated in the 1970s. Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records. The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands.

The inspiration for Zouk's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian <a href="compas">compas</a>, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by <a href="Grammacks">Grammacks</a> and <a href="Exile%20One">Exile One</a>. Elements of <a href="gwo%20ka">gwo ka</a>, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The <a href="French-based%20creole%20languages">French Creole</a> tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk emphasises star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings.

Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault believes zouk's evolution was influenced by other Caribbean styles especially <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a> cadence-lypso, Haitian <a href="Cadence%20rampa">cadence</a> and Guadeloupean "<a href="biguine">biguine</a>". Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of antillean music, as well as importing other genres.

The band <a href="Kassav">Kassav</a>' remain the best known zouk group. Kassav' drew in influences from <a href="balakadri">balakadri</a> and bal granmoun dances, <a href="biguine">biguine</a>'s and <a href="mazurka">mazurka</a>'s, along with more contemporary Caribbean influences like <a href="compas">compas</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a> and <a href="salsa%20music">salsa</a> music. Zouk live shows soon began to draw on American and European <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> and heavy metal traditions, and the genre spread across the world, primarily in developing countries.

Zouk has diversified into multiple subgenres. These include <a href="zouk-love">zouk-love</a>, pop ballads by artists like <a href="Edith%20Lefel">Edith Lefel</a> and <a href="Gilles%20Floro">Gilles Floro</a>, Zouk-<a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, and <a href="ragga-zouk">ragga-zouk</a> bands like <a href="Lord%20Kossity">Lord Kossity</a> who fused the genre with other influences.

Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or <a href="compas">compas</a>, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems.

The music <a href="kizomba">kizomba</a> from Angola and <a href="Coladeira%23The%20cola-zouk">cabo-love</a> from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas music style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is <a href="Ophelia%20Marie">Ophelia Marie</a>. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.
Popular artists include French West Indian artists <a href="Edith%20Lefel">Edith Lefel</a> and Nichols, or like Netherlands based <a href="Suzanna%20Lubrano">Suzanna Lubrano</a> and <a href="Gil%20Semedo">Gil Semedo</a>, the African artist <a href="Kaysha">Kaysha</a>.

Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular <a href="music%20of%20Dominica">music of Dominica</a>, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is <a href="Windward%20Caribbean%20Kulture">Windward Caribbean Kulture</a> (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and <a href="Dominican%20Creole%20French">Dominican Creole French</a>. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.

Due to the popularity of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the <a href="French%20Antilles">French Antilles</a>, a popular offshoot of bouyon from <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> is call <a href="Music%20of%20Guadeloupe%23Bouyon%20gwada">bouyon gwada</a>.
The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met Veye WCK, but remained stamped background music or carnival. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the <a href="World%20Creole%20Music%20Festival">World Creole Music Festival</a>, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and "Big Ting Poppin 'Daly alone.

A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is call <a href="bouyon%20music%23bouyon%20hardcore">bouyon hardcore</a>, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc.

Though zouk is the most well-known form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the "chouval bwa" and "biguine" styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like <a href="Claude%20Germany">Claude Germany</a>, <a href="Dede%20Saint-Prix">Dede Saint-Prix</a>, Pakatak and <a href="Tumpak">Tumpak</a>, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it a major influence on zouk. Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance "biguine" was popular among the islands' dance orchestras. The "biguine" uses a "cinquillo" variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like "<a href="m%C3%A9ringue">méringue</a>" and "<a href="Compas">Compas</a>". In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music.

The islands of <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>, <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a>, <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a> and <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a> share musical styles, as well as maintain their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and <a href="Soca%20music">soca</a>. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="China">China</a> and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the <a href="Combined%20Rhythm">Combined Rhythm</a>, like local favorites the <a href="Happy%20Peanuts">Happy Peanuts</a> and <a href="Expresando%20Rimto%20i%20Ambiente">Expresando Rimto i Ambiente</a>. <a href="Kaseko">Kaseko</a> music from the mainland country <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized by the use of complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the "tambú". Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, "agan", the <a href="rasp">rasp</a> "wiri", aerophones like the "cachu" trumpet, "becu" transverse double-reed wind instrument, and the <a href="bow%20%28musical%20instrument%29">bow</a> "benta".

The "tambu" is an instrument, and a form of music and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is sometimes known as "bari"), and Curaçao. The "tambu" is an especially important symbol of Curaçaoan identity. Instrumentation for the "tambu" uses the "agan", "chapi", <a href="triangle%20%28musical%20instrument%29">triangle</a>, "wiri" and other instruments, many of which are also part of the African-derived "muziek di zumbi", or "spirit music", of Curaçao. Curaçao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of <a href="work%20song">work song</a>s with apentatonic lyrics sung in <a href="Guene%20language">Guene</a> or a <a href="Papiamento">Papiamento</a> variant called "seshi". The <a href="Simadan">Simadan</a> harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the "cachu" trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable for the use of the "becu", an aerophone made from the stalk of a <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> plant, and the "kinkon", made from a <a href="conch">conch</a> shell and known elsewhere as the "carco". Folk song forms range from the harvest "seu", "simadan" and "wapa". Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American "<a href="joropo">joropo</a>" and "<a href="pasillo">pasillo</a>", Spanish Caribbean "<a href="merengue%20music">merengue</a>" and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the "<a href="Tumba%20%28music%20genre%29">tumba</a>".

The smaller islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely share in the same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba is home to a vital percussive music tradition, most closely associated with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the "<a href="ponum">ponum</a>", which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like "<a href="quimbe">quimbe</a>" song form, that remains a major part of the island's culture.

<a href="Indo-Caribbean%20people">Indo-Caribbean people</a> in the Lesser Antillean music area are clustered in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the "<a href="chowtal">chowtal</a>" songs from the springtime festival "phagwa", and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> "<a href="bhajan">bhajan</a>s" which are still sung at temples despite there being few people who understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that was referred to as "local music".

Indo-Caribbean music plays a vital role in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is traditionally performed competitively and in teams. Indo-Caribbean <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia Muslims</a> celebrate "Hosay" (<a href="Muharram">Muharram</a>) with <a href="Float%20%28parade%29">float</a>s accompanied by barrel drums called <a href="tassa">tassa</a>. <a href="Wedding%20music">Wedding music</a> is another important part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by <a href="tan%20singing">tan singing</a>. Tan singing is accompanied by the "<a href="dholak">dholak</a>" drum and "<a href="dhantal">dhantal</a>", and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by <a href="picong">picong</a>. Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of <a href="chutney%20music">chutney music</a>. Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by <a href="soca%20music">soca</a> instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called <a href="chutney-soca">chutney-soca</a>.

Vauxhall Bridge

Vauxhall Bridge is a <a href="Grade%20II%2A%20listed">Grade II* listed</a> steel and granite deck <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a> in central London. It crosses the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in a south–east north–west direction between <a href="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> on the south bank and <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a> on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge, originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge, built between 1809 and 1816 as part of a scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry.

The building of both bridges was problematic, with both the first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and operated as a <a href="toll%20bridge">toll bridge</a> before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>.

In 1963 it was proposed to replace the bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a>, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today is an important part of London's road system and carries the <a href="A202%20road">A202 road</a> across the Thames.

In the early 13th century, <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> mercenary <a href="Falkes%20de%20Breaut%C3%A9">Falkes de Breauté</a> built a manor house in the then empty marshlands of <a href="South%20Lambeth">South Lambeth</a>, across the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> from <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. In 1223–24, de Breauté and others revolted against <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>; following a failed attempt to seize the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, de Breauté's lands in England were forfeited and he was forced into exile in France and later Rome. The lands surrounding his Lambeth manor house continued to be known as Falkes' Hall, later Vauxhall.
With the exception of housing around the <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">New Spring Gardens</a> (later Vauxhall Gardens) pleasure park, opened in around 1661, the land at Vauxhall remained sparsely populated into the 19th century, with the nearest fixed river crossings being the bridges at <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster</a>, downstream, and <a href="Battersea%20Bridge">Battersea</a>, upstream. In 1806 a scheme was proposed by <a href="Ralph%20Dodd">Ralph Dodd</a> to open the south bank of the Thames for development, by building a new major road from <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Corner">Hyde Park Corner</a> to <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a> and <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, crossing the river upstream of the existing <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a>. The proprietors of Battersea Bridge, concerned about a potential loss of customers, petitioned Parliament against the scheme, stating that "[Dodd] is a well known adventurer and Speculist, and the projector of numerous undertakings upon a large scale most if not all of which have failed", and the bill was abandoned.

In 1809 a new bill was presented to Parliament, and the proprietors of Battersea Bridge agreed to allow it to pass and to accept compensation. The Bill incorporated the Vauxhall Bridge Company, allowing it to raise up to £300,000 (about £ in 2019) by means of mortgages or the sale of shares, and to keep all profits from any tolls raised. From these profits, the Vauxhall Bridge Company was obliged to compensate the proprietors of Battersea Bridge for any drop in revenue caused by the new bridge.

Dodd submitted a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches. However, soon after the 1809 Act was passed, he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and his design was abandoned. <a href="John%20Rennie%20the%20Elder">John Rennie</a> was commissioned to design and build the new bridge, and a stone bridge of seven arches was approved. On 9 May 1811, <a href="Thomas%20Dundas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dundas">Lord Dundas</a> laid the foundation stone of the bridge on the northern bank.

The Vauxhall Bridge Company ran into financial difficulties and was unable to raise more than the £300,000 stipulated in the 1809 Act, and a new Act was passed in 1812 permitting the Company to build a cheaper iron bridge. Rennie submitted a new design for an iron bridge of eleven spans, costing far less than the original stone design. Rennie's design was rejected, and instead construction began on a nine arch iron bridge designed by <a href="Samuel%20Bentham">Samuel Bentham</a>. Concerns were raised about the construction of the <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>, and engineer <a href="James%20Walker%20%28engineer%29">James Walker</a> was appointed to inspect the work. Walker's report led to the design being abandoned for the second time, and Walker himself was appointed to design and build a bridge of nine cast-iron arches with stone piers, the first iron bridge to be built across the Thames.
On 4 June 1816, over five years after construction began, the bridge opened, initially named Regent Bridge after <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George, Prince Regent</a>, but shortly afterwards renamed Vauxhall Bridge. The developers failed to pay the agreed compensation to the owners of Battersea Bridge and were taken to court; after a legal dispute lasting five years a judgement was made in favour of Battersea Bridge, with Vauxhall Bridge being obliged to pay £8,234 (about £ in 2019) compensation. As well as the compensation awarded by the courts to Battersea Bridge in 1821, the 1809 Act also obliged the Vauxhall Bridge Company to pay compensation to the operators of Huntley Ferry, the Sunday ferry service to Vauxhall Gardens, with the level to be decided by "a jury of 24 honest, sufficient and indifferent men". The bridge cost £175,000 (about £ in 2019) to build; with the costs of approach roads and compensation payments, the total cost came to £297,000 (about £ in 2019).

In anticipation of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">penny</a> for pedestrians to 2<a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">s</a> 6<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, the area around the bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 <a href="John%20Doulton">John Doulton</a> built the <a href="Royal%20Doulton">Doulton & Watts</a> (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class <a href="tenement">tenement</a>s to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large <a href="Millbank%20Penitentiary">Millbank Penitentiary</a> was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.
Usage rose considerably in 1838 when the terminus of the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> was built at nearby <a href="Nine%20Elms%20railway%20station">Nine Elms</a>. Nine Elms station proved inconvenient and unpopular with travellers, and in 1848 a new railway terminus was built closer to central London, at <a href="London%20Waterloo%20station">Waterloo Bridge station</a> (renamed "Waterloo Station" in 1886), and the terminus at Nine Elms was abandoned.

With the closure of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's main source of revenue was visitors to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a> flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a <a href="clown">clown</a> from <a href="Astley%27s%20Amphitheatre">Astley's Amphitheatre</a>, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> in a <a href="washtub">washtub</a> towed by <a href="goose">geese</a>.

Despite early setbacks and the construction nearby in the 19th century of three competing bridges (<a href="Lambeth%20Bridge">Lambeth Bridge</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20Bridge">Chelsea Bridge</a> and <a href="Albert%20Bridge%2C%20London">Albert Bridge</a>), the rapid urban growth of London made Vauxhall Bridge very profitable. The annual income from tolls rose from £4,977 (about £ in 2019) in its first full year of operation, to £62,392 in 1877 (about £ in 2019). In 1877 the <a href="Metropolis%20Toll%20Bridges%20Act%201877">Metropolis Toll Bridges Act</a> was passed, allowing the <a href="Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</a> (MBW) to buy all London bridges between <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith Bridge</a> and <a href="Waterloo%20Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</a> and free them from tolls.

In 1879 the bridge was bought by the MBW for £255,000 (about £ in 2019) and tolls on the bridge were lifted. Inspections of the bridge by the MBW following the purchase found that the two central piers were badly eroded, exposing the timber cradles on which the piers rested. Large quantities of cement in bags were laid around the wooden cradles as an emergency measure; however, the cement bags themselves soon washed away. The piers were removed, replaced by a single large central arch. By this time the bridge was in very poor condition, and in 1895 the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> (LCC), which had taken over from the MBW in 1889, sought and gained Parliamentary approval to replace the bridge. Permission was granted by Parliament to raise the projected replacement costs of £484,000 (about £ in 2019) from <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> across the whole of London rather than only local residents, as a new bridge was considered to be of benefit to the whole of London.

In August 1898 a temporary wooden bridge was moved into place alongside the existing bridge, and the demolition of the old bridge began.

<a href="Alexander%20Binnie">Sir Alexander Binnie</a>, the resident engineer of the London County Council (LCC), submitted a design for a steel bridge, which proved unpopular. At the request of the LCC, Binnie submitted a new design for a bridge of five spans, to be built in concrete and faced with granite.

Work on Binnie's design began, but was beset by problems. Leading architects condemned the design, with <a href="Arthur%20Beresford%20Pite">Arthur Beresford Pite</a> describing it as "a would-be Gothic architectural form of great vulgarity and stupid want of meaning", and <a href="Thomas%20Graham%20Jackson">T G Jackson</a> describing the bridge designs as a sign of "the utter apparent indifference of those in authority to the matter of art". Plans to build large stone <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s had to be suspended when it was found that the southern abutment would block the <a href="River%20Effra">River Effra</a>, which by this time had been diverted underground to serve as a storm relief sewer and which flowed into the Thames at this point. The Effra had to be rerouted to join the Thames to the north of the bridge. After the construction of the foundations and piers it was then discovered that the clay of the riverbed at this point would not be able to support the weight of a concrete bridge. With the granite piers already in place, it was decided to build a steel <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> onto the existing piers, and a superstructure long and wide was designed by Binnie and <a href="Maurice%20Fitzmaurice">Maurice Fitzmaurice</a> and built by LCC engineers at a cost of £437,000 (about £ in 2019).

The new bridge was eventually opened on 26 May 1906, five years behind schedule, in a ceremony presided over by the <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="Evan%20Spicer">Evan Spicer</a>, Chairman of the LCC. Charles Wall, who had won the contract to build the superstructure of the new bridge, paid the LCC £50 for the temporary wooden bridge, comprising of timber and 580 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> of scrap metal.

The new bridge was built to a starkly functional design, and many influential architects had complained about the lack of consultation from any architects during the design process by the engineers designing the new bridge. In 1903, during the construction of the bridge, the LCC consulted with architect <a href="William%20Edward%20Riley">William Edward Riley</a> regarding possible decorative elements that could be added to the bridge. Riley proposed erecting two <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylons</a> topped with statues at one end of the bridge, and adding decorative sculpture to the bridge piers. The pylons were rejected on grounds of cost, but following further consultation with leading architect <a href="Richard%20Norman%20Shaw">Richard Norman Shaw</a> it was decided to erect monumental bronze statues above the piers, and <a href="Alfred%20Drury">Alfred Drury</a>, <a href="George%20Frampton">George Frampton</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Pomeroy">Frederick Pomeroy</a> were appointed to design appropriate statues.
Frampton resigned from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's "Agriculture", "Architecture", "Engineering" and "Pottery", whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's "Science", "Fine Arts", "Local Government" and "Education". Each statue weighs approximately two <a href="Long%20ton">tons</a>. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.

The new bridge soon became a major transport artery and today carries the <a href="A202%20road">A202</a> across the Thames. Originally built with <a href="tram%20track">tram track</a>s, New Vauxhall Bridge was the first in central London to carry trams. Initially it carried horse-drawn trams, but shortly after the bridge's opening it was converted to carry the electric trams of <a href="London%20County%20Council%20Tramways">London County Council Tramways</a>; it continued to carry trams until the ending of tram services in 1951. In 1968 Vauxhall Bridge and <a href="Park%20Lane%20%28road%29">Park Lane</a> became the first roads in London to have <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>s; during weekday evening rush hours, the central lane of the bridge was reserved for southbound buses only.

During the Second World War the government was concerned that Axis bombers would target the bridge, and a temporary bridge known as Millbank Bridge was built parallel to Vauxhall Bridge, downstream. Millbank Bridge was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting <a href="tank">tank</a>s and other heavy military equipment. In the event, Vauxhall Bridge survived the war undamaged, and in 1948 Millbank Bridge was dismantled. Its girders were shipped to <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and used to span a tributary of the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a>.

In 1963 the <a href="Glass%20Age%20Development%20Committee">Glass Age Development Committee</a> commissioned a design for a replacement bridge at Vauxhall, inspired by the design of the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a>, to be called the Crystal Span. The Crystal Span was to have been a seven-story building supported by two piers in the river, overhanging the river banks at either end. The structure itself would have been enclosed in an air conditioned glass shell. The lowest floor would have contained two three-lane carriageways for vehicles, with a layer of shops and a skating rink in the centre of the upper floors. The southern end of the upper floors was to house a luxury hotel, whilst the northern end was to house the modern art collection of the nearby <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, which at this time was suffering from a severe shortage of display space. The roof was to have housed a series of roof gardens, observation platforms and courtyards, surrounding a large open-air theatre. The entire structure would have been long and wide. Despite much public interest in the proposals, the London County Council was reluctant to pay the estimated £7 million (£ in 2019) construction costs, and the scheme was abandoned.

In 1993, a remnant of the earliest known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550 BC and 300 BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed that it did not cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>'s account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55 BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.
Following the closure of a number of the area's industries, in the 1970s and 1980s the land at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge remained empty, following the failures of multiple redevelopment schemes. The most notable came in 1979 when <a href="Keith%20Wickenden">Keith Wickenden MP</a>, owner of the land at the immediate southern end of the bridge, proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the site. The development was to contain of office space, 100 luxury <a href="Apartment">flats</a> and a gallery to house the Tate Gallery's modern art collection. The offices were to be housed in a tower of green glass, which was nicknamed the "Green Giant" and met with much opposition. The then <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Environment">Secretary of State for the Environment</a>, <a href="Michael%20Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a>, refused permission for the development and the site remained empty.

In 1988 <a href="Regalian%20Properties">Regalian Properties</a> purchased the site, and appointed <a href="Terry%20Farrell%20%28architect%29">Terry Farrell</a> as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought the site and design as a future headquarters for the <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a>, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the <a href="SIS%20Building">SIS Building</a> was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings in the vicinity of the bridge.
In 2004 the <a href="Vauxhall%20Cross">Vauxhall Cross</a> area at the southern end of the bridge was redeveloped as a major transport interchange, combining a large bus station with the existing <a href="National%20Rail">National Rail</a> and <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> stations at <a href="Vauxhall%20station">Vauxhall</a>. Immediately to the east of the southern end of the bridge, a <a href="slipway">slipway</a> provides access for <a href="amphibious%20bus">amphibious bus</a>es between the road and river.

The only significant alteration to the structure of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a> (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a>s with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of <a href="Cycle%20Superhighway">Cycle Superhighway 5</a>.

The bridge was declared a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II* listed structure</a> in 2008, providing protection to preserve its character from alteration.

Mariano Rivera

Mariano Rivera (born November 29, 1969) is a <a href="Panamanian%20Americans">Panamanian-American</a> former professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> who played 19 seasons in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, from 1995 to 2013. Nicknamed "Mo" and "Sandman", he spent most of his career as a <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a> and served as the Yankees' <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> for 17 seasons. A thirteen-time <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> and five-time <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> champion, he is MLB's career leader in <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29">saves</a> (652) and <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20career%20games%20finished%20leaders">games finished</a> (952). Rivera won five <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="Rolaids%20Relief%20Man%20Award">Rolaids Relief Man Award</a>s and three <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Delivery%20Man%20Award">Delivery Man of the Year Awards</a>, and he finished in the top three in voting for the AL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> four times. He was elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in its <a href="2019%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting">class of 2019</a> in his first year of eligibility, becoming the first player ever to be elected unanimously by the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America">Baseball Writers' Association of America</a> (BBWAA).

Raised in the modest Panamanian fishing village of <a href="Puerto%20Caimito">Puerto Caimito</a>, Rivera was an amateur player until signed by the Yankees organization in 1990. He debuted in the major leagues in 1995 as a <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a>, before permanently converting to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a <a href="setup%20man">setup man</a>, he became the Yankees' closer in 1997. In the following seasons, he established himself as one of baseball's top relievers, <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20saves%20leaders">leading the major leagues in saves</a> in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving, mid-90s mile-per-hour <a href="cut%20fastball">cut fastball</a> that frequently broke hitters' bats and earned a reputation as one of the league's toughest <a href="pitch%20%28baseball%29">pitches</a> to hit. With his presence at the end of games, signaled by his foreboding entrance song "<a href="Enter%20Sandman">Enter Sandman</a>", Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees' success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. An accomplished <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">postseason</a> performer, he was named the <a href="1999%20World%20Series">1999</a> <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP)</a> and the <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2003</a> <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">AL Championship Series MVP</a>, and he holds several postseason records, including lowest <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA) (0.70) and most saves (42).

Rivera is regarded within baseball as one of the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25 games in 15 consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21 ERA and 1.00 <a href="Walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched">WHIP</a> are the lowest in the <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a> among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise <a href="Control%20pitcher">control</a>, smooth pitching motion, and for his composure and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>. A devout Christian, Rivera has been involved in <a href="Philanthropy">philanthropic</a> causes and the religious community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation.

Mariano Rivera was born in <a href="Panama%20City">Panama City</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, on November 29, 1969, to Mariano Rivera Palacios and Delia Jiron. The couple's second child, Rivera has one older sister, Delia, and two younger brothers, Alvaro and Giraldo. Supported by Mariano Sr.'s job as captain of a <a href="fishing%20boat">fishing boat</a>, the family lived in <a href="Puerto%20Caimito">Puerto Caimito</a>, a Panamanian <a href="fishing%20village">fishing village</a> that Rivera described as "poor". As a young man, Rivera played <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a> and <a href="baseball">baseball</a> with his friends on the beach during low <a href="tide">tide</a>. Soccer was his favorite sport, and <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> his favorite athlete. For baseball games, they substituted cardboard milk cartons for <a href="baseball%20glove">gloves</a> and tree branches for <a href="baseball%20bat">bats</a>, and they fashioned balls by taping wads of shredded fishing nets. Rivera used this makeshift equipment until his father bought him his first leather glove when he was 12 years old. Speaking about his youth, Rivera said that although he stayed out of trouble, he "was hanging with the wrong people".

Rivera attended Escuela Victoriano Chacón for elementary school and La Escuela Secundaria Pedro Pablo Sanchez for his secondary education, but he dropped out in ninth grade. At age 16, he began to learn the fishing trade by working on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching <a href="sardine">sardine</a>s. Rivera, who worked six-day weeks, year round, called the job "extremely hard" and was more interested in becoming a <a href="mechanic">mechanic</a>. Two incidents on his father's boat further validated his doubts about fishing as a career. In 1988, Rivera's uncle Miguel was lashed by an unsecured rope that shot off a hydraulic mechanism, and a month later he died from his injuries. About a year later, at age 19, Rivera was forced to abandon his father's ship after it began <a href="Shipwrecking">capsizing</a> due to a malfunctioning water pump and an overweight load of fish. After three years of learning the trade, Rivera quit. He continued to play sports during his teenage years but eventually quit soccer after a series of ankle and knee injuries around age 17. Consequently, he shifted his attention to baseball but considered it just a hobby rather than a potential profession.

At age 18, Rivera joined the <a href="Panam%C3%A1%20Oeste%20Province">Panamá Oeste</a> Vaqueros, a local amateur baseball team, as a <a href="utility%20player">utility player</a>. <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">Scout</a> Herb Raybourn watched him play <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> in a 1988 baseball tournament but did not project him to be a major leaguer. A year later, Panamá Oeste's <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the <a href="Amateur%20sports">amateur</a> <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> to a contract with the Yankees organization on February 17, 1990; the contract included a <a href="signing%20bonus">signing bonus</a> of US$2,500 ($ today), according to <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) records.

After signing his contract, Rivera—who spoke no English and had never left home—flew to the United States and reported to the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20League">Gulf Coast League</a> (GCL) <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20League%20Yankees">Yankees</a>, a <a href="Rookie%20League">Rookie</a> level <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> affiliate of the New York Yankees. Feeling lonely and homesick, he wrote home to his parents often, as they did not have access to telephones in Puerto Caimito. At that point in his career, scouts considered Rivera to be a "fringe <a href="Prospect%20%28sports%29">prospect</a>" at best, but he made progress with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief</a>, he allowed only 24 <a href="Baserunning%23Becoming%20a%20runner">baserunners</a> and one <a href="earned%20run">earned run</a> in 52 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a>—a 0.17 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA). The team permitted Rivera to <a href="Starting%20pitcher">start</a> the season's final game in order for him to accumulate enough innings pitched to qualify for the league's ERA title (which carried a $500 bonus); his subsequent seven-inning <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> "put him on the map with the organization", according to <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Glenn%20Sherlock">Glenn Sherlock</a>. In the offseason, Rivera returned to Panama, where a tip from him to Raybourn led to the Yankees signing a promising local 16-year-old player, Rivera's cousin <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Rivera">Rubén</a>. In 1991, Mariano was promoted to the <a href="Class%20A%20%28baseball%29">Class A</a> level <a href="Greensboro%20Grasshoppers">Greensboro Hornets</a> of the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20League">South Atlantic League</a>, where he started 15 of the 29 games in which he pitched. Despite a 4–9 <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a>, he recorded a 2.75 ERA in  innings pitched and <a href="strikeout">struck out</a> 123 <a href="batting%20%28baseball%29">batters</a> while <a href="base%20on%20balls">walking</a> 36 batters. <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20managers">New York Yankees manager</a> <a href="Buck%20Showalter">Buck Showalter</a> took notice of Rivera's strong <a href="strikeout-to-walk%20ratio">strikeout-to-walk ratio</a>, calling it "impressive in any league" and saying, "This guy is going to make it."

In 1992, Rivera was promoted to the <a href="Class%20A-Advanced">Class A-Advanced</a> level <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%20Yankees">Fort Lauderdale Yankees</a> of the <a href="Florida%20State%20League">Florida State League</a> (FSL). He started 10 games for Fort Lauderdale, compiling a 5–3 win–loss record and a 2.28 ERA. He attempted to improve the movement on his <a href="slider">slider</a> pitch by snapping his wrist during his throwing motion, but he inadvertently caused <a href="Ulnar%20collateral%20ligament%20injury%20of%20the%20elbow">damage</a> to the <a href="Ulnar%20collateral%20ligament%20of%20elbow%20joint">ulnar collateral ligament</a> (UCL) in his right elbow. Rivera underwent surgery in August 1992 to repair the damage, ending his season and interrupting his minor league career. Contrary to popular belief, he did not have <a href="Tommy%20John%20surgery">Tommy John surgery</a>; his surgeon, Dr. <a href="Frank%20Jobe">Frank Jobe</a>, determined that ligament replacement was not necessary and instead repaired the frayed UCL. Rivera's rehabilitation coincided with <a href="1992%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion%20draft">MLB's 1992 expansion draft</a> to fill the rosters for two <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>s, the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> and <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a>. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees but was not drafted. He successfully rehabilitated his arm in early 1993 and resumed pitching that year. He first joined the Rookie level Yankees to make two abbreviated starts, before returning to the Class A level Hornets to start ten more games. Witnessing him rehabilitate, the Hornets' <a href="official%20scorer">official scorer</a> Ogi Overman was not optimistic about Rivera's future, saying, "I thought [he] was on a one-way trip to nowhere."

In 1994, he was promoted from the Class A-Advanced level <a href="Tampa%20Tarpons">Tampa Yankees</a> of the FSL to the <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> level <a href="Richmond%20Flying%20Squirrels">Albany-Colonie Yankees</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Eastern League</a>, and then to the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> level <a href="Columbus%20Clippers">Columbus Clippers</a> of the <a href="International%20League">International League</a>. Rivera finished the year with a 10–2 record in 22 starts, although he struggled for Columbus, recording a 5.81 ERA in six starts. At the start of the 1995 season, he was ranked the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees organization by sports magazine "<a href="Baseball%20America">Baseball America</a>"; by contrast, the publication ranked Rivera's highly touted cousin Rubén as the second-best prospect in baseball. Mariano's pitching repertoire primarily consisted of <a href="fastball">fastball</a>s at the time, although he threw a slider and <a href="changeup">changeup</a> as secondary pitches. He began the 1995 season with Columbus, pitching to a 1–1 record and 1.50 ERA in four starts.

After being called up to the major leagues on May 16, 1995, Rivera made his debut for the New York Yankees on May 23 against the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a>. Starting in place of injured pitcher <a href="Jimmy%20Key">Jimmy Key</a>, Rivera allowed five earned runs in  innings pitched in a 10–0 loss. He struggled through his first four major league starts, posting a 10.20 ERA, and as a result, he was demoted to Columbus on June 11. As a 25-year-old rookie just three years removed from major arm surgery, Rivera did not have a guaranteed spot in the Yankee organization. Management considered <a href="Trade%20%28sports%29">trading</a> him to the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> for starter <a href="David%20Wells">David Wells</a>. While recovering from a sore shoulder in the minor leagues, Rivera pitched a no-hit <a href="Shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> in a <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29%23Baseball">rain-shortened</a> five-inning start. Reports from the game indicated that his pitches had reached , about faster than his previous average velocity; Rivera attributes his inexplicable improvement to <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God</a>. Yankees <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> <a href="Gene%20Michael">Gene Michael</a> was skeptical of the reports until verifying that Columbus' <a href="radar%20gun">radar gun</a> was not faulty and that another team's scout had taken the same measurements. Afterwards, he ended any trade negotiations involving Rivera. On July 4, in his first start back in the major leagues, Rivera pitched eight scoreless innings against the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, allowing just two <a href="Hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> while striking out 11 batters. In five subsequent starts, he was unable to match his success from that game. After a brief demotion to Columbus in August, Rivera made one last start in the major leagues in September before he was moved to the Yankees' <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a>. Overall, he finished his first major league season with a 5–3 record and a 5.51 ERA in ten starts and nine relief outings. His performance in the <a href="1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">1995 American League Division Series</a>, in which he pitched  scoreless innings of relief, convinced Yankees management to keep him and convert him to a relief pitcher the following season.
In 1996, Rivera served primarily as a <a href="setup%20pitcher">setup pitcher</a>, typically pitching in the seventh and eighth <a href="inning">inning</a>s of games before <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> <a href="John%20Wetteland">John Wetteland</a> pitched in the ninth. Their effectiveness as a tandem helped the Yankees win 70 of 73 games that season when leading after six innings. Over a stretch of games between April 19 and May 21, Rivera pitched 26 consecutive scoreless innings, including 15 consecutive hitless innings. During the streak, he recorded his first career <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">save</a> in a May 17 game against the Angels. Rivera finished the regular season with a 2.09 ERA in  innings pitched and set a Yankees single-season record for strikeouts by a reliever (130). <a href="Baseball-Reference.com">Baseball-Reference.com</a> calculated his value to the Yankees that year to be 5.0 <a href="wins%20above%20replacement">wins above replacement</a> (WAR), a figure no reliever has surpassed in a single season since. In the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">postseason</a>, he allowed just one earned run in  innings pitched, helping the Yankees advance to and win the <a href="1996%20World%20Series">1996 World Series</a> against the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>. It was the franchise's first <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championship since 1978. In MLB's annual awards voting by the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America"></a>, Rivera finished in twelfth place for the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a> and third for the AL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>, which is given to the league's best pitcher. Commentator and former player <a href="Tim%20McCarver">Tim McCarver</a> wrote that the Yankees "revolutionized baseball" that year with Rivera, "a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was a legitimate MVP candidate."

Yankees management chose not to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him with Rivera as the team's closer. In April 1997, MLB <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> for breaking the <a href="baseball%20color%20line">baseball color line</a>, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a <a href="grandfather%20clause">grandfather clause</a>. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28B%29%23blown%20save">blew</a> three of his first six <a href="Save%20%28baseball%29%23Usage">save opportunities</a> and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a>, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> selection with 27 saves and a 1.96 ERA at the midseason break. In the <a href="1997%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1997 All-Star Game</a>, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a <a href="cut%20fastball">cut fastball</a> to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43 saves in 52 opportunities and a 1.88 ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the <a href="1997%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">1997 AL Division Series</a> against the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>; with the Yankees four <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a> from advancing to the next round of the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to <a href="Sandy%20Alomar%20Jr.">Sandy Alomar Jr.</a> The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.

After spending two weeks on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> with a groin <a href="strain%20%28injury%29">strain</a> during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by <a href="Middle%20relief%20pitcher">middle relievers</a> <a href="Jeff%20Nelson%20%28baseball%29">Jeff Nelson</a> and <a href="Mike%20Stanton%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Mike Stanton</a>, contributed to the team's late-1990s <a href="dynasty%20%28sports%29">dynasty</a>. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36 games in 41 opportunities and had a 1.91 ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched  scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the <a href="1998%20World%20Series">1998 World Series</a> against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125 games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51 ERA—and by passing 30 innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141 innings pitched.
In 1999, Rivera was selected for the All-Star team for a second time with 23 saves and a 2.29 ERA in the first half of the season. That summer, the <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> scoreboard production staff began playing the song "<a href="Enter%20Sandman">Enter Sandman</a>" by <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> as Rivera's <a href="entrance%20music">entrance music</a>. Staff members selected the song after witnessing in the previous year's World Series how enthusiastically San Diego fans reacted to closer <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a> entering games accompanied by <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>'s "<a href="Hells%20Bells%20%28song%29">Hells Bells</a>". Although Rivera was indifferent about his entrance music, "Enter Sandman" soon became as much a part of his identity as a closer as his cutter. After recording three blown saves and a 7.84 ERA in July, he allowed just one earned run over his last 30 <a href="games%20pitched">appearances</a>. He ended the season with a 1.83 ERA and 45 saves in 49 opportunities, his first time <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20saves%20leaders">leading the major leagues in saves</a>. He received his first AL <a href="Rolaids%20Relief%20Man%20Award">Rolaids Relief Man Award</a>, an annual award for the league's best closer based on their statistics. In the <a href="1999%20World%20Series">1999 World Series</a> against the Braves, Rivera recorded a win and two saves, the second of which clinched the Yankees' championship title, his third overall. For his performance against Atlanta, he received the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP Award</a>. Rivera finished 1999 by pitching 43 consecutive scoreless innings in the regular season and postseason combined, and he placed third in voting for the AL Cy Young Award. After the season, he revealed tentative plans to retire and become a <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a> after playing four more seasons, though he backed off these plans the following year.
In the offseason, Rivera lost his <a href="salary%20arbitration">salary arbitration</a> case, in which he requested an annual salary of $9.25 million, but arbitrators awarded him $7.25 million per year, which was at the time the highest <a href="arbitration%20award">arbitration award</a> in baseball history. In the 2000 season, Rivera was selected as an All-Star for the third time. On July 8, he saved two games, each played in a different ballpark, as part of a day-night <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheader</a> against the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> at <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> and Yankee Stadium. He ended the season with 36 saves in 41 opportunities and a 2.85 ERA. In the postseason, Rivera saved six games, allowed three earned runs in  innings pitched, and broke two major league records: he eclipsed <a href="Dennis%20Eckersley">Dennis Eckersley</a>'s record for postseason saves with the 16th of his career; he also broke <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a>'s record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason play, a streak that ended shortly thereafter at  innings. In the <a href="2000%20World%20Series">2000 World Series</a> against the Mets, Rivera clinched a championship for his team for the third consecutive year. It was his fourth World Series title overall. By this point, he had established a reputation as an exceptional postseason performer—journalist <a href="Jack%20Curry">Jack Curry</a> called him the "infallible weapon" and "the greatest reason the Yankees [were] three-time champions".
With Rivera's contract set to expire after 2001, the Yankees signed him to a four-year, $39.99 million deal prior to the season, marking the first long-term contract of his career. In 2001, he was selected for the All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included a 2.34 ERA, a closer career-high  innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 50 saves in 57 opportunities—his second time leading the league. His saves total that year surpassed <a href="Dave%20Righetti">Dave Righetti</a>'s 46 saves in 1986 for the most by a Yankee pitcher in a single season, and made him just the sixth MLB pitcher to reach 50 saves in a single season. Rivera's performance earned him his second AL Rolaids Relief Man Award. Despite having what sportswriters deemed an "aura of invincibility" in the postseason, Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a> against the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>. In one of his most infamous moments, he blew a save in the bottom of the ninth inning, in part due to his own throwing <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a>, and he lost the Series later in the inning by allowing <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a>'s <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28B%29%23blooper">bloop single</a> with the <a href="bases%20loaded">bases loaded</a> to score the winning run. It was the first and only loss of Rivera's postseason career, and it snapped his record streak of 23 consecutive postseason saves converted.

On May 9, 2002, Rivera recorded his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves. Over the next few months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47 ERA and 21 saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July 14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a <a href="walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off</a> <a href="Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a>. One week later, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August 8 after receiving a <a href="cortisone">cortisone</a> shot but returned to the disabled list after a recurrence of shoulder tightness. For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74 ERA and 28 saves in 32 opportunities in just 46 innings pitched.

To placate the Yankees' concerns about his durability, Rivera followed a strength and conditioning program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre said that he would try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16 games in 17 opportunities. His save on June 12 against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> secured the 300th career win for starter <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>. Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40 saves in 46 opportunities. In the <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2003 AL Championship Series</a> against the <a href="Yankees%E2%80%93Red%20Sox%20rivalry">arch-rival</a> <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, Rivera had one of the most memorable postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after <a href="Aaron%20Boone">Aaron Boone</a> hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the <a href="2003%20World%20Series">2003 World Series</a>. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">AL Championship Series MVP</a> for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a>; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16 innings pitched that postseason.

Prior to the 2004 season, with a year remaining on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth $21 million, with an <a href="Option%20contract">option</a> for a third year. That season, Rivera surpassed <a href="300%20save%20club">300 career saves</a> and made his sixth All-Star team with 32 saves at the midseason break, then an AL record. His final numbers for the year included a 1.94 ERA and a career-high 53 saves in 57 opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees' victory in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2004 AL Division Series</a> against the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives who had died in an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2004 AL Championship Series</a> against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a> to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's <a href="Dave%20Roberts%20%28outfielder%29">Dave Roberts</a> <a href="pinch%20runner">pinch ran</a> and <a href="stolen%20base">stole</a> second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> to tie the score. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series. Boston's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none.

Following a career high in appearances in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began on a low note. After missing time in <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> with elbow <a href="bursitis">bursitis</a>, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston dating back to the previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium <a href="Booing">booed</a> Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation with a sense of humor by <a href="Hat%20tip">tipping his cap</a> to the crowd.

Rivera rebounded in dominating fashion and finished 2005 with his greatest season to that point. He was selected to the All-Star team, converted 31 consecutive save opportunities, and completed the season with 43 saves in 47 opportunities. He set new career bests in many statistical categories, including ERA (1.38) and <a href="walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched">walks plus hits per inning pitched</a>, or WHIP (0.87). Rivera limited opposing hitters to a <a href="batting%20average%20against">batting average against</a> of .177, then the best mark of his closer career. In addition to winning a fourth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed second in voting for the AL Cy Young Award behind starter <a href="Bartolo%20Col%C3%B3n">Bartolo Colón</a>, and ninth for the AL MVP Award—his best finishes in voting for both awards. During the postseason, MLB announced the <a href="Latino%20Legends%20Team">Latino Legends Team</a>, a fan-voted all-time roster of the greatest <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Latino</a> players; Rivera was named the team's relief pitcher.

Rivera began 2006 with a 3.72 ERA and two losses in April, but his numbers improved in subsequent months. On June 6, he saved his 391st career game, passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth-most saves in major league history. Rivera was selected to his third consecutive All-Star team with a 1.76 ERA and 19 saves entering the midseason break. He saved the AL's comeback victory in the <a href="2006%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2006 All-Star Game</a> for his third career All-Star save, tying him with Eckersley for the most ever. On July 16, Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB pitcher to reach 400 saves. Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined Rivera for most of September, he finished the 2006 season with 34 saves in 37 opportunities and an ERA of 1.80—his fourth consecutive season with a sub-2.00 ERA. For a second consecutive year, fans voted him the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Delivery%20Man%20Award">Delivery Man of the Year</a>.
With his contract set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near the start of the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency at the end of the year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in  innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32 opportunities and posted a 2.26 ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed <a href="John%20Franco">John Franco</a> for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30 saves in 34 opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45 million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.

Rivera rebounded in 2008 and began the year with 16 consecutive scoreless innings pitched and 28 consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06 ERA and 23 saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the <a href="2008%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">2008 MLB All-Star Game</a>, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher as a tribute to him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September 15, he recorded his 479th save to pass <a href="Lee%20Smith%20%28baseball%29">Lee Smith</a> for second all-time in regular season saves; on September 21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring <a href="Brian%20Roberts%20%28baseball%29">Brian Roberts</a> of the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time in his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed <a href="calcification">calcification</a> of the <a href="acromioclavicular%20joint">acromioclavicular joint</a> in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor <a href="arthroscopic%20surgery">arthroscopic surgery</a> in the offseason.

Rivera's 2008 season was one of his best individual years. Along with a 1.40 ERA and 39 saves in 40 opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a> (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), <a href="save%20percentage">save percentage</a> (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81 <a href="strikeouts%20per%209%20innings%20pitched">strikeouts per 9 innings pitched</a>, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such <a href="Control%20pitcher">control</a> that his 12.83 strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50 innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.

In his first 12 appearances of 2009, Rivera surrendered four home runs and had a 3.97 ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June 28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500 regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer <a href="Francisco%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28Venezuelan%20pitcher%29">Francisco Rodríguez</a>, he collected his first career <a href="run%20batted%20in">run batted in</a> by walking with the bases loaded. With 23 saves in 24 opportunities and a 2.43 ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the <a href="2009%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">2009 MLB All-Star Game</a>, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40 appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76 ERA, 44 saves in 46 opportunities, and a 0.90 WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16 innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the <a href="2009%20World%20Series">2009 World Series</a> against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>" Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a>'s <a href="Jerry%20Crasnick">Jerry Crasnick</a> called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.

In 2010, Rivera and two of his "<a href="Core%20Four">Core Four</a>" teammates, <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> and <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>, became the first trio in any of the <a href="Major%20professional%20sports%20leagues%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">four major sports leagues in North America</a> (MLB, <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a>, <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA</a>, or <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">NHL</a>) to play together on the same team for 16 consecutive seasons. Rivera began with one of his best first halves, compiling a 1.05 ERA, 20 saves in 22 opportunities, and 0.64 WHIP before the All-Star break, and in June, he set a personal best streak with 24 consecutive batters retired. He earned an 11th All-Star selection but withdrew from the game due to lingering oblique and knee injuries. In the second half, he was less effective—he struck out batters half as often, and in September, he compiled three blown saves and a 4.76 ERA. Rivera ended 2010 with a 1.80 ERA and 0.83 WHIP, numbers that were among his career bests, though his 33 saves in 38 opportunities and 6.75 strikeouts per 9 innings ratio were below his career averages. In the postseason, he pitched  scoreless innings while saving three games. After becoming a free agent in the offseason, Rivera agreed to a two-year, $30 million contract to remain with the Yankees.
That same offseason, <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a> retired as the all-time regular season saves leader with a final tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman's record to start 2011. Rivera's season was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20career%20games%20finished%20leaders">games finished</a>, and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000 appearances and the first to do so with a single team. He was named an All-Star for the 12th time with a 1.85 ERA and 22 saves in 26 opportunities at the midseason break, but for the second consecutive year, he skipped the game to rest injuries. His pursuit of the saves record reached a climax in the final month of the season; on September 13, he collected his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat. Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history. Rivera broke the record on September 19 at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out by strikeout. After the game, Panamanian President <a href="Ricardo%20Martinelli">Ricardo Martinelli</a> called him to offer his congratulations. Rivera finished the season with a 1.91 ERA, a 0.90 WHIP, and 44 saves in 49 opportunities, making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40 games in a season. In the offseason, he underwent throat surgery to remove <a href="Polyp%20%28medicine%29">polyps</a> from his <a href="vocal%20cords">vocal cords</a>.

Rivera began the 2012 season by blowing a save on <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> but followed it with eight scoreless innings and five saves for the remainder of April. After just nine appearances, his season was prematurely ended by a freak injury; prior to a May 3 game against the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>, Rivera's right knee buckled on the field's <a href="warning%20track">warning track</a> while <a href="shagging%20%28baseball%29">shagging</a> balls during <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28B%29%23batting%20practice">batting practice</a>, causing him to <a href="Anterior%20cruciate%20ligament%20injury">tear</a> his right <a href="anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">anterior cruciate ligament</a> (ACL). Speculation grew that the injury would end his career, as he had hinted at retirement in spring training. Rivera put those concerns to rest the following day when he announced his intentions to return, saying, "Write it down in big letters. I'm not going down like this." He successfully underwent <a href="Anterior%20cruciate%20ligament%20reconstruction">ACL reconstructive surgery</a> on June 12, while his <a href="meniscus%20%28anatomy%29">meniscus</a>, previously thought to have been damaged, did not need to be repaired. <a href="Rafael%20Soriano">Rafael Soriano</a> filled in as closer in Rivera's absence and saved 42 games in 46 opportunities. Rivera signed a one-year, $10 million contract in the offseason to remain with the team.

After successfully rehabilitating his knee in the offseason, the 43-year-old Rivera announced on March 9, 2013, that he would retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: "It was important for me to meet the people who make baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than I have given them." Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city. In Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song "Enter Sandman". The Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the "Chair of Broken Dreams". The rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well. <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> dedicated a <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757</a> airplane with Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a> retired "Enter Sandman" from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.

Rivera's 10 saves in 10 opportunities in April were his highest total for the opening month of a season. He converted his first 18 save attempts of the season until blowing a save against the Mets on May 28; it was the first time that he blew a save and lost a game without recording an out. Rivera entered the midseason break with 30 saves in 32 opportunities and a 1.83 ERA, and he was named an All-Star for the 13th time in his career, the second-most All-Star selections for a pitcher behind <a href="Warren%20Spahn">Warren Spahn</a>'s 17. During the <a href="2013%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a>, held at <a href="Citi%20Field">Citi Field</a> in New York, Rivera was called upon to pitch in the eighth inning for his final All-Star appearance. As he trotted onto the field, players from both teams remained near their <a href="Dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugouts</a> and joined fans in giving Rivera a standing ovation as he stood alone on the field. Rivera retired all three batters he faced, preserving his 0.00 career ERA in All-Star Games. He was named the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star Game MVP</a>, making him the first reliever selected to an All-Star team to ever receive the award, as well as the first pitcher since <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a> in 1999 and the second Yankee ever after Derek Jeter in 2000. He became the first MLB player to be named the MVP of a World Series, <a href="League%20Championship%20Series">League Championship Series</a>, and All-Star Game. Rivera's performance dipped in the second half of the season, as he blew five save opportunities in the last two months, including three consecutive chances for the first time in his career. In a <a href="Fox%20Sports">Fox Sports</a> documentary chronicling his final season, entitled "Being: Mariano", Rivera said that his farewell to baseball had mentally and physically drained him and that by September, he had "no desire" left for the sport.

On September 22, 2013, a day that <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a> <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> declared "Mariano Rivera Day", the Yankees held a 50-minute pre-game tribute to Rivera at Yankee Stadium. In a ceremony attended by former teammates, Yankees staff, and members of Jackie Robinson's family, Rivera's uniform number 42 was retired by the team, making him the first active Yankee to receive that honor. Metallica performed "Enter Sandman" live as he walked onto the field during the festivities. The team presented a video montage and several gifts to Rivera before he addressed the crowd to offer his thanks. Four days later against the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a>, he pitched in the final game of his career before a home crowd at Yankee Stadium. Entering in the eighth inning to a pre-recorded introduction by late Yankees public address announcer <a href="Bob%20Sheppard">Bob Sheppard</a>, Rivera pitched  innings without allowing a baserunner. In the ninth inning, after retiring <a href="Yunel%20Escobar">Yunel Escobar</a> on a pop fly for the second out, Rivera was removed from the game; with permission from the umpires, Yankees manager <a href="Joe%20Girardi">Joe Girardi</a> ceremonially delegated the substitution duty to Rivera's long-time teammates <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a> and Derek Jeter. After they reached the mound to make the pitching change, the normally reserved Rivera tearfully embraced his teammates for nearly a minute. Walking off the field to a standing ovation from fans and players, he saluted the crowd and then took a <a href="curtain%20call">curtain call</a>. After the game, he visited the mound for a final time and grabbed a handful of dirt as a memento. Rivera finished his final season with a 2.11 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, and 44 saves in 51 opportunities, earning him the AL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Comeback%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Comeback Player of the Year Award</a>, among several awards. During the World Series, he was honored as the 13th recipient of the <a href="Commissioner%27s%20Historic%20Achievement%20Award">Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award</a> for his accomplished career and for being "a great ambassador of the game".

Rivera's signature pitch was a <a href="cut%20fastball">cut fastball</a> or "cutter", which exhibited lateral movement towards left-handed hitters similar to that of a <a href="slider">slider</a> but with the velocity of a <a href="fastball">fastball</a>. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the <a href="Sweet%20spot%20%28sports%29%23Baseball%20bat">sweet spot</a> of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on <a href="batted%20ball">batted ball</a>s but also frequently breaking their bats. According to a tally by columnist <a href="Buster%20Olney">Buster Olney</a>, Rivera broke 44 bats during the 2001 regular season. <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a>, who once witnessed teammate <a href="Ryan%20Klesko">Ryan Klesko</a> break three bats in one <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a> against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a "buzz saw". Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist allowed him to impart more spin on the ball, contributing to the pitch's movement. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, "it's really a <a href="four-seam%20fastball">four-seam fastball</a> with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and <a href="two-seam%20fastball">two-seam fastball</a>s as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website <a href="Fangraphs">Fangraphs</a>, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90s mph.

Early in his major league career, Rivera was a "<a href="power%20pitcher">power pitcher</a>" who relied on an overpowering four-seam fastball that topped out at to retire hitters. By enticing them to swing and miss at pitches high in the <a href="strike%20zone">strike zone</a>, he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate. Rivera altered his pitching style after accidentally discovering the cutter. One day in June 1997 during one of his daily warm-up tosses with teammate <a href="Ramiro%20Mendoza">Ramiro Mendoza</a>, Rivera noticed that his fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably, a problem that began to occur in games as well. After unsuccessfully spending a month trying to eliminate the movement, Rivera relented and incorporated the cutter into his pitching repertoire, making it one of his primary pitches in 1998. When asked about the pitch's origin, he explained, "It was just from God. I didn't do anything. It was natural." As he came to rely on the cutter, Rivera began to record more outs on batted balls. Consequently, his strikeout rate decreased in subsequent years, dropping from 10.87 strikeouts per 9 innings in 1996 to 5.3 in 1998, but at the benefit of more efficiency; his <a href="pitch%20count">pitches per inning</a> rate dropped from 18.7 in 1995 to 14.9 in 1998. Rivera credited his improved efficiency and consequent longevity in baseball to his long-time pitching coach <a href="Mel%20Stottlemyre">Mel Stottlemyre</a>.

Rivera had an impeccable ability to accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, particularly on the inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks tenth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, <a href="Darrin%20Fletcher">Darrin Fletcher</a>, said in 1999 that Rivera "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding."
Although <a href="switch-hitter">switch-hitter</a>s usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28J%29%23jam">jammed</a> on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as <a href="Bruce%20Bochy">Bruce Bochy</a> in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hit</a> for left-handers against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk breaking their best ones against his cutter.

Rivera was considered an exceptional athlete, distinguished by his slender physique and durability. His propensity to shag balls during batting practice convinced scouts he could be a top AL <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a>. Olney compared Rivera's regimen of physical preparation and guidelines for staying healthy to <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a>'s "Rules for Staying Young". Former teammate <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> expressed amazement at Rivera's athleticism and claimed that the pitcher completed a 35-inch <a href="vertical%20jump">vertical jump</a> at Yankees training camp at age 41.

Rivera exhibited a reserved demeanor on the field that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament of many of his peers. Hall of Fame closer <a href="Goose%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a> said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." His ability to <a href="Compartmentalization%20%28psychology%29">compartmentalize</a> his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever <a href="Joba%20Chamberlain">Joba Chamberlain</a>, who said, "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying "the game that you're going to play tomorrow is not going to be the same game that you just played." Derek Jeter called him the "most mentally tough" teammate with whom he had ever played.

During his playing career, Rivera was regarded as a team leader within the Yankees organization, often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling teammates. He had a team-first mindset and deferred most discussions about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates, praising them for making his presence in games possible. When once asked to describe his job, Rivera put it simply, "I get the ball, I throw the ball, and then I take a shower."

Rivera was a dominant reliever throughout his career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic of a role commonly marked by volatility and high <a href="Turnover%20%28employment%29">turnover</a>. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is the major leagues' all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and <a href="games%20finished">games finished</a> (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most in AL history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen non-consecutive); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen non-consecutive); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). Rivera's career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a> (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making him one of the top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, tying him with <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a> for the most such seasons (minimum 60 innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career <a href="adjusted%20ERA%2B">adjusted ERA+</a> (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.

In addition to his strong regular season numbers, Rivera excelled in the postseason, recording an 8–1 win–loss record and a 0.76 WHIP. He holds numerous postseason records, including lowest career ERA (minimum 30 innings pitched) (0.70), most saves (42), most consecutive scoreless innings pitched (), most consecutive save opportunities converted (23), and most games pitched (96). As of 2018, Rivera has saved twice as many postseason games as any other pitcher; <a href="Brad%20Lidge">Brad Lidge</a>, with 18, had the next-highest total. Joe Torre, who managed Rivera for most of his career, said, "Let's face it. The regular season for Mo is great, but that's the cupcakes and the ice cream. What separates him from everybody else is what he's done in the postseason." Rivera's dominance in the postseason often led to him being utilized for two-inning appearances, as he saved a record 14 postseason games in this manner—more than all other relievers combined during his career. He ranks first all time in <a href="win%20probability%20added">win probability added</a> in the postseason with 11.7, nearly three times the total of the next-closest player. In a 2009 ESPN.com poll, Rivera was voted one of the top five postseason players in MLB history.
Rivera achieved a reputation as an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." Writer <a href="Tom%20Verducci">Tom Verducci</a> said, "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position in the history of baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>. MLB Commissioner <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a> said, "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did it in a way that was remarkable." Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that." Gossage said that Rivera "might be the greatest closer of all-time" but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning "firemen" from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.
Rivera is well respected throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer <a href="Joe%20Nathan">Joe Nathan</a> said, "I look up to how he's handled himself on and off the field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." <a href="Michael%20Young%20%28baseball%29">Michael Young</a> said of Rivera, "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [Jorge] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." In a "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; at the time of his retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow <a href="Rachel%20Robinson">Rachel</a> said: "[Rivera] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42."

Rivera's cut fastball was a respected pitch among major league hitters. <a href="Jim%20Thome">Jim Thome</a> called it "the single best pitch ever in the game". <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> echoed his sentiment, saying: "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but the really amazing thing is how he was able to do it for so many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best "<a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28O%29%23out%20pitch">out pitch</a>" in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Several of Rivera's colleagues credit him with popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer <a href="Jason%20Isringhausen">Jason Isringhausen</a>, who adopted the pitch later in his career, said: "I think he's been an influence on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [Rivera] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, you talk about the evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." <a href="Al%20Leiter">Al Leiter</a>, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch." In 2008, <a href="Roy%20Halladay">Roy Halladay</a> consulted Rivera for help with his own cutter and traced the reliever's suggested grip onto a baseball as a visual reference; Rivera's willingness to help an opponent drew a playful fine from his teammates in the Yankees' <a href="Kangaroo%20court%23As%20informal%20proceedings%20in%20sports">kangaroo court</a>.

Rivera was elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> by the BBWAA on January 22, 2019, in his first year of eligibility. He became the first player in major league history to be elected unanimously, appearing on all 425 ballots; the previous record for election percentage was held by <a href="Ken%20Griffey%20Jr.">Ken Griffey Jr.</a>, who received 99.3% of votes in <a href="2016%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting">2016</a>. Rivera is just the second Panamanian to be elected to the Hall of Fame after <a href="Rod%20Carew">Rod Carew</a>, and just the eighth relief pitcher.

Rivera and his wife Clara have known each other since <a href="elementary%20school">elementary school</a>, and they were married on November 9, 1991. They have three sons: Mariano III, Jafet, and Jaziel. The family lived in Panama until 2000, when they relocated to <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County, New York</a>; they currently reside in <a href="Rye%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Rye, New York</a>. Mariano III pitched for <a href="Iona%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Iona College</a> in <a href="New%20Rochelle%2C%20New%20York">New Rochelle</a>, not far from his home. He was drafted by the Yankees with the 872nd pick in the <a href="2014%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">2014 MLB draft</a>, but decided to return to Iona for his junior year. In the <a href="2015%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">following year's draft</a>, Mariano III was selected by the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> in the 4th round with the 134th overall pick.

Over the course of his professional career, Rivera learned English, beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets, when he realized none of his teammates spoke his native Spanish. He is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press members learning Spanish, in order to bridge the cultural gap. Rivera became a <a href="Naturalization">naturalized</a> citizen of the United States in October 2015, and was recognized as an Outstanding American by Choice during the ceremony.

In February 2019, a Panamanian woman accused Rivera of failing to financially support two children, a boy and a girl then aged 11 and 15, that she and Rivera had allegedly conceived out of wedlock. Five lawsuits were filed in Rivera's native country demanding <a href="child%20support">child support</a> that he allegedly stopped paying two years earlier. He called the demands "unfounded."

Rivera is a devout Christian. During his childhood, neither he nor his family attended church, but after a <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born-again</a> experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> to a <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a> easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate <a href="Enrique%20Wilson">Enrique Wilson</a>. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> on <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%20587">American Airlines Flight 587</a>, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend." Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> verse <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Philippians">Philippians</a> 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").

Rivera is involved with <a href="philanthropy">philanthropic</a> efforts in several countries. The Mariano Rivera Foundation, a <a href="501%28c%29%283%29%20organization">501(c)(3) organization</a> established in July 1998, helps provide underprivileged children with an education, distributing more than $500,000 annually in the US and Rivera's native Panama through church-based institutions. His contributions in Panama include building an elementary school, providing Christmas gifts to children, and developing a program that provides computer access and adult mentors to youths. In addition to funding church start-ups in Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, California, and Florida, Rivera opened a church in New Rochelle in March 2014 that his foundation renovated at a cost of $3 million. The church, named Refugio de Esperanza ("Refuge of Hope"), has his wife Clara as its <a href="pastor">pastor</a> and hosts a Pentecostal congregation that previously met at the Rivera home.

For years, the Mariano Rivera Foundation was a <a href="Private%20foundation%20%28United%20States%29">private institution</a>, but during his final baseball season in 2013, many teams wanted to commemorate the pitcher by donating to his foundation. As a result, he formed a <a href="Charitable%20organization%23United%20States">public version</a> of it; Naomi Gandia was appointed executive director and works out of their headquarters in <a href="Stanton%2C%20Delaware">Stanton, Delaware</a>. Since retiring from baseball, Rivera has dedicated himself to philanthropy and his churches. In 2014, he and Clara created a <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> in their names that they have awarded to students at the local <a href="College%20of%20New%20Rochelle">College of New Rochelle</a>. Recently, Rivera has organized an annual charity golf tournament that benefits <a href="White%20Plains%20Hospital">White Plains Hospital</a> and his foundation. He also holds multiple events annually in Delaware, including giveaways of backpacks with school supplies to children, distribution of turkey dinners during the holiday season, and the "Mariano Rivera Foundation <a href="5K%20run">5K</a> & Kids Run".

In 2012, the Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera donated $627,500 to charity in 2010, ranking him as the 25th-most generous celebrity on a list that the fund compiled. He won the 2013 <a href="Marvin%20Miller%20Man%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award</a>, which is given to the MLB player "who inspires others through his on-field performances and contributions to his community".

Rivera was an investor in two New York area restaurants: "Clubhouse Grill", which opened in New Rochelle in 2006 as "Mo's New York Grill"; and Siro's, which opened in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 2012. Both restaurants have since closed. In 2015, he opened a <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> and <a href="Scion%20%28automobile%29">Scion</a> <a href="car%20dealership">car dealership</a> in <a href="Mount%20Kisco%2C%20New%20York">Mount Kisco, New York</a>. Rivera has been a <a href="celebrity%20spokesman">celebrity spokesman</a> for several companies, including: <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> sports apparel; <a href="Canali">Canali</a>, a premium men's clothing company, as their first athlete spokesperson; <a href="Skechers">Skechers</a> footwear; and <a href="The%20Hartford">Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.</a> Rivera donated all his earnings from endorsement deals to his foundation. A 2011 list by the marketing firm <a href="Nielsen%20Company">Nielsen</a> ranked him as the second-most marketable player in baseball behind only Derek Jeter; the list accounted for personal attributes such as sincerity, approachability, experience, and influence. Based on sales figures from <a href="Majestic%20Athletic">Majestic Athletic</a>, Rivera had the 18th-best-selling MLB jersey in 2011, and the top-selling jersey in the second half of 2013. He earned approximately $169.6 million in salary during his baseball career, ten percent of which he donated to his foundation.

In March 2014, Rivera was twice recognized for his philanthropic efforts, receiving the ROBIE Humanitarian Award from the <a href="Jackie%20Robinson%20Foundation">Jackie Robinson Foundation</a>, as well as a <a href="Jefferson%20Awards%20for%20Public%20Service">Jefferson Award for Public Service</a>. Later that month, the "Legends Series", comprising two MLB exhibition games between the Yankees and Miami Marlins, was played in Rivera's native Panama to "honor [his] legacy"; he helped promote the games, which were supplemented by charitable events and a gala benefiting his foundation. On April 9, 2014, MLB announced that a new annual award for relief pitchers, the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Reliever%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Reliever of the Year Award</a>, would replace the existing Delivery Man of the Year Award, and that the AL honor would be named after Rivera. The following month, a section of River Avenue bordering Yankee Stadium at 161st Street was renamed "Rivera Avenue" in the pitcher's honor. This coincided with the release of his autobiography, "The Closer: My Story", co-authored with Wayne Coffey. <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> bestowed an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctor of Humane Letters</a> degree upon Rivera during its commencement ceremony at Yankee Stadium on May 21, 2014. During the <a href="2015%20Little%20League%20World%20Series">2015 Little League World Series</a>, he was inducted into the <a href="Peter%20J.%20McGovern%20Little%20League%20Museum">Little League Hall of Excellence</a>. The Yankees dedicated a plaque to Rivera in Yankee Stadium's <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a> on August 14, 2016. In May 2018, Rivera was nominated to co-chair the <a href="President%27s%20Council%20on%20Fitness%2C%20Sports%2C%20and%20Nutrition">President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition</a>.

Al-Mu'tasim

Abū Isḥāq Muḥammad ibn Hārūn al-Rashīd (; October 796 – 5 January 842), better known by his <a href="laqab">regnal name</a> al-Muʿtaṣim biʾllāh (, "he who seeks refuge in God"), was the eighth <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid caliph</a>, ruling from 833 until his death in 842. A younger son of Caliph <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>, he rose to prominence through his formation of a private army composed predominantly of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkish</a> slave-soldiers ("<a href="ghilman">ghilmān</a>"). This proved useful to his half-brother, Caliph <a href="al-Ma%27mun">al-Ma'mun</a>, who employed al-Mu'tasim and his Turkish guard to counterbalance other powerful interest groups in the state, as well as employing them in campaigns against rebels and the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. When al-Ma'mun died unexpectedly on campaign in August 833, al-Mu'tasim was thus well placed to succeed him, overriding the claims of al-Ma'mun's son <a href="al-Abbas%20ibn%20al-Ma%27mun">al-Abbas</a>.

Al-Mu'tasim continued many of his brother's policies, such as the partnership with the <a href="Tahirids">Tahirids</a>, who ruled <a href="Khurasan">Khurasan</a> and <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> on behalf of the Abbasids. With the support of the powerful chief "<a href="qadi">qādī</a>", <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Abi%20Duwad">Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad</a>, he continued to implement the rationalist Islamic doctrine of <a href="Mu%27tazilism">Mu'tazilism</a> and the persecution of its opponents through the inquisition ("<a href="mihna">miḥna</a>"). Although not personally interested in literary pursuits, al-Mu'tasim also nurtured the scientific renaissance begun under al-Ma'mun. In other ways, his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in Islamic history, with the creation of a new regime centred on the military, and particularly his Turkish guard. In 836, a new capital was established at <a href="Abbasid%20Samarra">Samarra</a> to symbolize this new regime and remove it from the restive populace of Baghdad. The power of the caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced the power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in Samarra, and the fiscal apparatus of the state was more and more dedicated to the maintenance of the professional army, which was dominated by Turks. The Arab and Iranian elites that had played a major role in the early period of the Abbasid state were increasingly marginalized, and an abortive conspiracy against al-Mu'tasim in favour of al-Abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks. This strengthened the position of the Turks and their principal leaders, <a href="Ashinas">Ashinas</a>, <a href="Wasif%20al-Turki">Wasif</a>, <a href="Itakh">Itakh</a>, and <a href="Bugha%20the%20Elder">Bugha</a>. Another prominent member of al-Mu'tasim's inner circle, the prince of <a href="Ushrusana">Ushrusana</a>, <a href="al-Afshin">al-Afshin</a>, fell afoul of his enemies at court and was overthrown and killed in 840/1. The rise of the Turks would eventually result in the troubles of the "<a href="Anarchy%20at%20Samarra">Anarchy at Samarra</a>" and lead to the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the "ghulām"-based system inaugurated by al-Mu'tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world.

Al-Mu'tasim's reign was marked by continuous warfare. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running <a href="Khurramite">Khurramite</a> uprising of <a href="Babak%20Khorramdin">Babak Khorramdin</a> in <a href="Adharbayjan">Adharbayjan</a>, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835–837, and against <a href="Mazyar">Mazyar</a>, the autonomous ruler of <a href="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a>, who had clashed with the Tahirids and risen up in revolt. While his generals led the fight against internal rebellions, al-Mu'tasim himself led the sole major external campaign of the period, in 838 against the Byzantine Empire. His armies <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzen">defeated</a> Emperor <a href="Theophilos%20%28emperor%29">Theophilos</a> and <a href="Sack%20of%20Amorium">sacked</a> the city of <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.

Muhammad, the future al-Mu'tasim, was born in the <a href="Khuld%20Palace">Khuld ("Eternity") Palace</a> in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, but the exact date is unclear: according to the historian <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a> (839–923), his birth was placed by authorities either in <a href="Sha%27ban">Sha'ban</a> <a href="Anno%20Hegirae">AH</a> 180, (i.e. October 796), or in AH 179 (i.e. spring 796 or earlier). His parents were the fifth <a href="Abbasid%20caliph">Abbasid caliph</a>, <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> (), and Marida bint Shabib, a slave concubine. Otherwise unknown, Marida was born in <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a> in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, but her family hailed from <a href="Soghdia">Soghdia</a>, and she is usually considered to have been of <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> origin.

The young prince's early life coincided with what, in the judgment of posterity, was the <a href="golden%20age%20%28metaphor%29">golden age</a> of the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. The abrupt downfall of the powerful <a href="Barmakid">Barmakid</a> family, which had dominated government during the previous decades, in 803 hinted at political instability at the highest levels of the court, while rebellions that were suppressed with difficulty provided warning signals about the dynasty's hold over the empire. Nevertheless, compared to the strife and division that followed in the decades after Harun's death, the Abbasid empire was living through its <a href="wikt%3Ahalcyon%20days">halcyon days</a>. Harun still ruled directly over the bulk of the Islamic world of his time, from <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="Sind">Sind</a> in the east to the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> in the west. Lively trade networks linking <a href="Tang%20China">Tang China</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> with Europe and Africa passed through the caliphate, with Baghdad as the nexus, ensuring its prosperity. The revenues of the provinces kept the treasury full, allowing the Caliph to launch <a href="Abbasid%20invasion%20of%20Asia%20Minor%20%28806%29">huge expeditions</a> against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and engage in vigorous diplomacy, his envoys arriving even at the distant court of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>. This wealth also allowed considerable patronage: charitable endowments to the <a href="Holiest%20sites%20in%20Islam">Muslim holy cities</a> of <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina">Medina</a> and the welcoming of <a href="faqih">religious scholars</a> and ascetics at court secured the benevolence of the religious classes towards the dynasty, while the funds lavished on poets guaranteed its lasting fame; the splendour of the caliphal court provided the inspiration for some of the earliest stories of the "<a href="Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Thousand and One Nights</a>".

As an adult, Muhammad was commonly called by his "<a href="kunya%20%28Arabic%29">kunya</a>", Abu Ishaq. Al-Tabari describes the adult Abu Ishaq as "fair-complexioned, with a black beard the hair tips of which were red and the end of which was square and streaked with red, and with handsome eyes". Other authors stress his physical strength and his love for physical activity—an anecdote recalls how during the Amorium campaign he went ahead of the army riding on a mule and searched in person for a ford across a river—in stark contrast to his more sedentary predecessors and successors. Later authors write that he was almost illiterate, but as the historian <a href="Hugh%20N.%20Kennedy">Hugh Kennedy</a> comments, this "would have been most improbable for an Abbasid prince", and most likely reflects his lack of interest in intellectual pursuits.

As one of Harun's younger sons, Abu Ishaq was initially of little consequence, and did not figure in the line of succession. Soon after Harun died in 809, a <a href="Fourth%20Fitna">vicious civil war</a> broke out between his elder half-brothers <a href="al-Amin">al-Amin</a> () and <a href="al-Ma%27mun">al-Ma'mun</a> (). Al-Amin enjoyed the backing of the traditional Abbasid elites in Baghdad (the "<a href="abna%27%20al-dawla">abnāʾ al-dawla</a>"), while al-Ma'mun was supported by other sections of the "abnāʾ". Al-Ma'mun emerged victorious in 813 with the surrender of Baghdad after a <a href="Siege%20of%20Baghdad%20%28812%E2%80%93813%29">long siege</a> and the death of al-Amin. Choosing to remain in his stronghold in <a href="Khurasan">Khurasan</a>, on the northeastern periphery of the Islamic world, al-Ma'mun allowed his main lieutenants to rule in his stead in Iraq. This resulted in a wave of antipathy towards al-Ma'mun and his "Persian" lieutenants, both among the Abbasid elites in Baghdad and generally in the western regions of the Caliphate, culminating in the nomination of Harun al-Rashid's younger brother <a href="Ibrahim%20ibn%20al-Mahdi">Ibrahim</a> as anti-caliph at Baghdad in 817. This event made al-Ma'mun realise his inability to rule from afar; bowing to popular reaction, he dismissed or executed his closest lieutenants, and returned in person to Baghdad in 819 to begin the difficult task of rebuilding the state.

Throughout the conflict and its aftermath, Abu Ishaq remained in Baghdad. Al-Tabari records that Abu Ishaq led the <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a> pilgrimage in 816, accompanied by many troops and officials, among whom was <a href="Hamdawayh%20ibn%20Ali%20ibn%20Isa%20ibn%20Mahan">Hamdawayh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan</a>, who had just been appointed to the governorship of the <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> and was on his way there. During his stay in Mecca, his troops defeated and captured a pro-<a href="Alid">Alid</a> leader who had raided the pilgrim caravans. He also led the pilgrimage the following year, but no details are known. It appears that at least during this time, Abu Ishaq was loyal to al-Ma'mun and his viceroy in Iraq, <a href="al-Hasan%20ibn%20Sahl">al-Hasan ibn Sahl</a>, but, like most members of the dynasty and the "abnāʾ" of Baghdad, he supported his half-uncle Ibrahim against al-Ma'mun in 817–819.

From , Abu Ishaq began forming his corps of Turkish troops. The first members of the corps were domestic slaves he bought in Baghdad (the distinguished general <a href="Itakh">Itakh</a> was originally a cook) whom he trained in the art of war, but they were soon complemented by Turkish slaves sent directly from the fringes of the Muslim world in Central Asia, under an agreement with the local <a href="Samanid">Samanid</a> rulers. This private force was small—it probably numbered between three and four thousand at the time of his accession to the throne—but it was highly trained and disciplined, and made Abu Ishaq a man of power in his own right, as al-Ma'mun increasingly turned to him for assistance.

The long civil war shattered the social and political order of the early Abbasid state; the "abnāʾ al-dawla", the main political and military pillar of the early Abbasid state, had been much reduced by the civil war. Along with the "abnāʾ", the old Arab families settled in the provinces since the time of the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a>, and the members of the extended Abbasid dynasty formed the core of the traditional elites and largely supported al-Amin. During the remainder of al-Ma'mun's reign they lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. Furthermore, as the civil war raged in the eastern half of the caliphate and in Iraq, the western provinces slipped from Baghdad's control in a series of rebellions that saw local strongmen claiming various degrees of autonomy or even trying to secede from the caliphate altogether. Although he had overthrown the old elites, al-Ma'mun lacked a large and loyal power base and army, so he turned to "<a href="new%20men">new men</a>" who commanded their own military retinues. These included the <a href="Tahirids">Tahirids</a>, led by <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Tahir">Abdallah ibn Tahir</a>, and his own brother Abu Ishaq. Abu Ishaq's Turkish corps was politically useful to al-Ma'mun, who tried to lessen his own dependence on the mostly eastern Iranian leaders, such as the Tahirids, who had supported him in the civil war, and who now occupied the senior positions in the new regime. In an effort to counterbalance their influence, al-Ma'mun granted formal recognition to his brother and his Turkish corps. For the same reason he placed the Arab tribal levies of the <a href="Mashriq">Mashriq</a> (the region of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and Iraq) in the hands of his son, <a href="al-Abbas%20ibn%20al-Ma%27mun">al-Abbas</a>.

The nature and identity of the "Turkish slave soldiers", as they are commonly described, is a controversial subject; both the ethnic label and the slave status of its members are disputed. Although the bulk of the corps were clearly of servile origin, being either captured in war or purchased as slaves, in the Arabic historical sources they are never referred to as slaves ("<a href="mamluk">mamlūk</a>" or "ʿabid"), but rather as "<a href="mawali">mawālī</a>" ("clients" or "freedmen") or "<a href="ghilman">ghilmān</a>" ("pages"), implying that they were <a href="manumit">manumit</a>ted, a view reinforced by the fact that they were paid cash salaries. Although members of the corps are collectively called simply "Turks", "atrāk", in the sources, prominent early members were neither Turks nor slaves, but rather Iranian vassal princes from Central Asia like <a href="al-Afshin">al-Afshin</a>, prince of <a href="Usrushana">Usrushana</a>, who were followed by their personal retinues (Persian "chakar", Arabic "<a href="shakiriyya">shākiriyya</a>"). Likewise, the motives behind the formation of the Turkish guard action are unclear, as are the financial means available to Abu Ishaq for the purpose, particularly given his young age. The Turks were closely associated with Abu Ishaq, and are usually interpreted as a private military retinue, something not uncommon in the Islamic world of the time. As the historian Matthew Gordon points out, the sources provide some indications that the original recruitment of Turks may have been begun or encouraged by al-Ma'mun, as part of the latter's general policy of recruiting Central Asian princes—and their own military retinues—to his court. It is therefore possible that the guard was originally formed on Abu Ishaq's initiative, but that it quickly received caliphal sanction and support, in exchange for being placed under al-Ma'mun's service.

In 819 Abu Ishaq, accompanied by his Turkish guard and other commanders, was sent to suppress a <a href="Kharijite">Kharijite</a> uprising under <a href="Mahdi%20ibn%20Alwan%20al-Haruri">Mahdi ibn Alwan al-Haruri</a> around <a href="Buzurj-Sabur">Buzurj-Sabur</a>, north of Baghdad. According to a most likely fanciful story provided by the 10th-century chronicler <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a>, <a href="Ashinas">Ashinas</a>, in later years one of the chief Turkish leaders, received his name when he placed himself between a Kharijite lancer about to attack the future caliph, shouting, "Recognize me!" (in Persian ""ashinas ma-ra"").

In 828, al-Ma'mun appointed Abu Ishaq as governor of <a href="Egypt%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Egypt</a> and <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syria</a> in place of Abdallah ibn Tahir, who departed to assume the governorship of <a href="Khurasan">Khurasan</a>, while the <a href="al-Jazira%2C%20Mesopotamia">Jazira</a> and the frontier zone ("<a href="thughur">thughūr</a>") with the Byzantine Empire passed to al-Abbas. Ibn Tahir had just brought Egypt back under caliphal authority and pacified it after the tumult of the civil war, but the situation remained volatile. When Abu Ishaq's deputy in Egypt, <a href="Umayr%20ibn%20al-Walid">Umayr ibn al-Walid</a>, tried to raise taxes, the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> and Hawf regions revolted. In 830, Umayr tried to forcibly subdue the rebels, but was ambushed and killed along with many of his troops. With the government troops confined to the capital, <a href="Fustat">Fustat</a>, Abu Ishaq intervened in person, at the head of his 4,000 Turks. The rebels were soundly defeated and their leaders executed.
In July–September 830, al-Ma'mun, encouraged by perceived Byzantine weakness and suspicious of collusion between Emperor <a href="Theophilos%20%28emperor%29">Theophilos</a> () and the <a href="Khurramite">Khurramite</a> rebels of <a href="Babak%20Khorramdin">Babak Khorramdin</a>, launched the first large-scale invasion of Byzantine territory since the start of the Abbasid civil war, and sacked several Byzantine border fortresses. Following his return from Egypt, Abu Ishaq joined al-Ma'mun in his 831 campaign against the Byzantines. After rebuffing Theophilos' offers of peace, the Abbasid army passed through the <a href="Cilician%20Gates">Cilician Gates</a> and divided into three columns, with the Caliph, his son al-Abbas, and Abu Ishaq at their head. The Abbasids seized and destroyed several minor forts as well as the town of <a href="Tyana">Tyana</a>, while al-Abbas won a minor skirmish against a Byzantine army led by Theophilos in person, before withdrawing to Syria in September.

Soon after Abu Ishaq's departure from Egypt, the revolt flared up again, this time encompassing both the Arab settlers and the native Christian <a href="Copts">Copts</a> under the leadership of Ibn Ubaydus, a descendant of one of the original <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">Arab conquerors</a> of the country. The rebels were confronted by the Turks, led by al-Afshin. Al-Afshin conducted a systematic campaign, winning a string of victories and engaging in large-scale executions: many male Copts were executed and their women and children sold into slavery, while the old Arab elites who had ruled the country since the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 640s were practically annihilated. In early 832, al-Ma'mun came to Egypt, and soon after the last elements of resistance, the Copts of the coastal marshes of the Nile Delta, were subdued.

Later in the same year, al-Ma'mun repeated his invasion of the Byzantine borderlands, capturing the strategically important fortress of <a href="Loulon">Loulon</a>, a success that consolidated Abbasid control of both exits of the Cilician Gates. So encouraged was al-Ma'mun by this victory that he repeatedly rejected Theophilos' ever more generous offers for peace, and publicly announced that he intended to capture <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> itself. Consequently, al-Abbas was dispatched in May to convert the deserted town of Tyana into a military colony and prepare the ground for the westward advance. Al-Ma'mun followed in July, but he suddenly fell ill and died on 7 August 833.

Al-Ma'mun had made no official provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough to rule and had acquired experience of command in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account of al-Tabari, on his deathbed al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as caliph on 9August, with the <a href="regnal%20name">regnal name</a> of al-Mu'tasim (in full "al-Muʿtaṣim bi’llāh", "he who seeks refuge in God"). It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, later historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, but it is clear that his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas refused them, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce in al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20September.

Whatever the true background of his accession, al-Mu'tasim owed his rise to the throne not only to his strong personality and leadership skills, but principally to the fact that he was the only Abbasid prince to control independent military power, in the form of his Turkish corps. Unlike his brother, who tried to use the tribal Arabs and the Turks to balance out the Iranian troops, al-Mu'tasim relied almost exclusively on his Turks; the historian Tayeb El-Hibri describes al-Mu'tasim's regime as "militaristic and centred on the Turkish corps". The rise of al-Mu'tasim to the caliphate thus heralded a radical change in the nature of Abbasid administration, and the most profound shift the Islamic world had experienced since the dynasty had come to power in the <a href="Abbasid%20Revolution">Abbasid Revolution</a>. While the latter had been backed by a mass popular movement seeking to enact social reforms, al-Mu'tasim's revolution was essentially the project of a small ruling elite aiming to secure its own power.

Already under al-Ma'mun, old-established Arab families such as the <a href="Muhallabids">Muhallabids</a> disappeared from the court, and minor members of the Abbasid family ceased to be appointed to governorships or senior military positions. The reforms of al-Mu'tasim completed this process, resulting in the eclipse of the previous Arab and Iranian elites, both in Baghdad and the provinces, in favour of the Turkish military, and an increasing centralization of administration around the caliphal court. A characteristic example is Egypt, where the Arab settler families still nominally formed the country's garrison ("<a href="jund">jund</a>") and thus continued to receive a salary from the local revenues. Al-Mu'tasim discontinued the practice, removing the Arab families from the army registers ("<a href="divan">diwān</a>") and ordering that the revenues of Egypt be sent to the central government, which would then pay a cash salary ("ʿaṭāʾ") only to the Turkish troops stationed in the province. Another departure from previous practice was al-Mu'tasim's appointment of his senior lieutenants, such as Ashinas and Itakh, as nominal super-governors over several provinces. This measure was probably intended to allow his chief followers immediate access to funds with which to pay their troops, but also, according to Kennedy, "represented a further centralizing of power, for the under-governors of the provinces seldom appeared at court and played little part in the making of political decisions". Indeed, al-Mu'tasim's caliphate marks the apogee of the central government's authority, in particular as expressed in its right and power to extract taxes from the provinces, an issue that had been controversial and had faced much local opposition since the early days of the Islamic state.

The one major exception to this process were the Tahirids, who remained in place as autonomous governors of their Khurasani super-province, encompassing most of the eastern Caliphate. The Tahirids provided the governor of Baghdad, and helped to keep the city, a focus of opposition under al-Ma'mun, quiescent. The post was held throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign by Abdallah ibn Tahir's cousin <a href="Ishaq%20ibn%20Ibrahim%20al-Mus%27abi">Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab</a>, who, according to the Orientalist <a href="C.%20E.%20Bosworth">C. E. Bosworth</a>, was "always one of al-Mu'tasim's closest advisers and confidants". Apart from the Turkish military and the Tahirids, al-Mu'tasim's administration depended on the central fiscal bureaucracy. As the main source of revenue were the rich lands of southern Iraq (the <a href="Sawad">Sawad</a>) and neighbouring areas, the administration was staffed mostly with men drawn from these regions. The new caliphal bureaucratic class that emerged under al-Mu'tasim were thus mostly Persian or <a href="Aramaeans">Aramean</a> in origin, with a large proportion of newly converted Muslims and even a few <a href="Nestorian%20Christians">Nestorian Christians</a>, who came from landowner or merchant families.

On his accession, al-Mu'tasim appointed as his chief minister or <a href="vizier">vizier</a> his old personal secretary, <a href="al-Fadl%20ibn%20Marwan">al-Fadl ibn Marwan</a>. A man trained in the traditions of the Abbasid bureaucracy, he was distinguished for his caution and frugality, and tried to shore up the finances of the state. These traits eventually caused his downfall, when he refused to authorize the Caliph's gifts to his courtiers on the grounds that the treasury could not afford it. He was dismissed in 836, and was lucky not to suffer any punishment more severe than being sent into exile to the village of al-Sinn. His replacement, <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20al-Zayyat">Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat</a>, was of a completely different character: a rich merchant, he is described by Kennedy as "a competent financial expert but a callous and brutal man who made many enemies", even among his fellow members of the administration. Nevertheless, and even though his political authority never extended beyond the fiscal domain, he managed to maintain his office to the end of the reign, and under al-Mu'tasim's successor, <a href="al-Wathiq">al-Wathiq</a>, () as well.

Al-Mu'tasim's reliance on his Turkish "ghilmān" grew over time, especially in the aftermath of an abortive plot against him discovered in 838, during the Amorium campaign. Headed by <a href="%27Ujayf%20ibn%20%27Anbasa">Ujayf ibn Anbasa</a>, a long-serving Khurasani who had followed al-Ma'mun since the civil war against al-Amin, the conspiracy rallied the traditional Abbasid elites, dissatisfied with al-Mu'tasim's policies and especially his favouritism towards to the Turks. Discontent with the latter grew due to their servile origin, which offended the Abbasid aristocracy. The plotters aimed to kill the Caliph and raise al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas in his stead. According to al-Tabari, al-Abbas, although privy to these designs, rejected Ujayf's urgent suggestions to kill al-Mu'tasim during the initial stages of the campaign for fear of appearing to undermine the <a href="jihad">jihad</a>. In the event, Ashinas grew suspicious of al-Farhgani and Ibn Hisham, and the plot was soon uncovered. Al-Abbas was imprisoned, and the Turkish leaders Ashinas, Itakh, and <a href="Bugha%20the%20Elder">Bugha the Elder</a> undertook to discover and arrest the other conspirators. The affair was the signal for a large-scale purge of the army that Kennedy describes as "of almost <a href="Stalin">Stalin</a>esque ruthlessness". Al-Abbas was forced to die of thirst, while his male offspring were arrested, and likely executed, by Itakh. The other leaders of the conspiracy were likewise executed in ingeniously cruel ways, which were widely publicized as a deterrent to others. According to the "<a href="Kitab%20al-%27Uyun">Kitab al-'Uyun</a>", about seventy commanders and soldiers were executed, including some Turks.

As the historian Matthew Gordon points out, these events are probably connected to the disappearance of the "abnāʾ" from the historical record. Correspondingly they must have increased the standing of the Turks and their chief commanders, particularly Ashinas: in 839, his daughter, Utranja, married the son of al-Afshin, and in 840, al-Mu'tasim appointed him as his deputy during his absence from Samarra. When he returned, al-Mu'tasim publicly placed him on a throne and awarded him with a ceremonial crown. In the same year, Ashinas was appointed to a super-governorate over the provinces of Egypt, Syria and the Jazira. Ashinas did not govern these directly, but appointed deputies as governors, while he remained in Samarra. When Ashinas participated in the Hajj of 841, he received honours on every stop of the route. In 840, it was the turn of al-Afshin to fall victim to the Caliph's suspicions. Despite his distinguished service as a general, he was very much the "odd man out" in the Samarran elite; the relations of the Iranian prince with the low-born Turkish generals were marked by mutual antipathy. Furthermore, he alienated the Tahirids, who might under other circumstances have been his natural allies, by interfering in <a href="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a>, where he allegedly encouraged the local autonomous ruler, <a href="Mazyar">Mazyar</a>, to reject Tahirid control (see <a href="%23Mazyar">below</a>). Al-Tabari reports other allegations against al-Afshin: that he was plotting to poison al-Mu'tasim; or that he was planning to escape to his native Ushrusana with vast sums of money. According to Kennedy, the very variety of allegations against al-Afshin is grounds for skepticism about their truthfulness, and it is likely that he was framed by his enemies at court. Whatever the truth, these allegations discredited al-Afshin in the eyes of al-Mu'tasim. He was dismissed from his position in the caliphal bodyguard ("al-ḥaras"), and a <a href="show%20trial">show trial</a> was held at the palace, where he was confronted with several witnesses, including Mazyar. Al-Afshin was accused, among other things, of being a false Muslim, and of being accorded <a href="Shirk%20%28Islam%29">divine status</a> by his subjects in Ushrusana. Despite putting up an able and eloquent defence, al-Afshin was found guilty and thrown into prison. He died soon after, either of starvation or of poison. His body was publicly <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a>ed in front of the palace gates, burned, and thrown in the Tigris. Once more, the affair enhanced the standing of the Turkish leadership, and particularly <a href="Wasif%20al-Turki">Wasif</a>, who now received al-Afshin's revenues and possessions.

Nevertheless, it seems that al-Mu'tasim was not entirely satisfied with the men he had raised to power. An anecdote dating from his last years, relayed by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, recalls how the Caliph, in an intimate exchange with Ishaq, lamented that he had made poor choices in this regard: while his brother al-Ma'mun had nurtured four excellent servants from the Tahirids, he had raised al-Afshin, who was dead; Ashinas, "a feeble heart and a coward"; Itakh, "who is totally insignificant"; and Wasif, "an unprofitable servant". Ishaq himself then suggested that this was because, while al-Ma'mun had used men with local connections and influence, al-Mu'tasim had used men with no roots in the Muslim community, to which the Caliph sadly assented.

The Turkish army was at first quartered in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with the remnants of the old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace. The latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to the foreign troops, who were furthermore often undisciplined and violent, spoke no Arabic, and were either recent converts to Islam or still pagans. Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became common.

This was a major factor in al-Mu'tasim's decision in 836 to found a new capital at <a href="Abbasid%20Samarra">Samarra</a>, some north of Baghdad, but there were other considerations in play. Founding a new capital was a public statement of the establishment of a new regime. According to Tayeb El-Hibri it allowed the court to exist "at a distance from the populace of Baghdad and protected by a new guard of foreign troops, and amid a new royal culture revolving around sprawling palatial grounds, public spectacle and a seemingly ceaseless quest for leisurely indulgence", an arrangement compared by <a href="Oleg%20Grabar">Oleg Grabar</a> to the relationship between <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a> after <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>. By creating a new city in a previously uninhabited area, al-Mu'tasim could reward his followers with land and commercial opportunities without cost to himself and free from any constraints, unlike Baghdad with its established interest groups and high property prices. In fact, the sale of land seems to have produced considerable profit for the treasury—in the words of Kennedy, "a sort of gigantic property speculation in which both government and its followers could expect to benefit".

Space and life in the new capital were strictly regimented: residential areas were separated from the markets, and the military was given its own cantonments, separated from the ordinary populace and each the home of a specific ethnic contingent of the army (such as the Turks or the <a href="Maghariba%20%28Abbasid%20troops%29">Maghariba</a> regiment). The city was dominated by its mosques (most famous among which is the <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20Samarra">Great Mosque of Samarra</a> built by Caliph <a href="al-Mutawakkil">al-Mutawakkil</a> in 848–852) and palaces, built in grand style by both the caliphs and their senior commanders, who were given extensive properties to develop. Unlike Baghdad, the new capital was an entirely artificial creation. Poorly sited in terms of water supply and river communications, its existence was determined solely by the presence of the caliphal court, and when the capital returned to Baghdad, sixty years later, Samarra was rapidly abandoned. Due to this, the ruins of the Abbasid capital are still extant, and the city can be mapped with great accuracy by modern archaeologists.

As a military man, al-Mu'tasim's outlook was utilitarian, and his intellectual pursuits could not be compared with those of al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, but he continued his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a <a href="Science%20in%20the%20medieval%20Islamic%20world">major centre of learning</a> throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers <a href="Habash%20al-Hasib%20al-Marwazi">Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi</a> and <a href="Ahmad%20al-Farghani">Ahmad al-Farghani</a>, the polymath <a href="al-Jahiz">al-Jahiz</a>, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher <a href="al-Kindi">al-Kindi</a>, who dedicated his work "On First Philosophy" to his patron al-Mu'tasim. The Nestorian physician <a href="Salmawayh%20ibn%20Bunan">Salmawayh ibn Bunan</a>, a patron of the fellow Nestorian physician and <a href="Translation%20Movement">translator</a> <a href="Hunayn%20ibn%20Ishaq">Hunayn ibn Ishaq</a>, became court physician to al-Mu'tasim, while another prominent Nestorian physician, Salmawayh's rival <a href="Ibn%20Masawayh">Ibn Masawayh</a>, received apes for <a href="dissection">dissection</a> from the Caliph.

Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed the footsteps of al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for <a href="Mu%27tazilism">Mu'tazilism</a>, a theological doctrine that attempted to tread a middle way between <a href="secular">secular</a> monarchy and the <a href="theocratic">theocratic</a> approach espoused by the Alids and the various sects of <a href="Shi%27ism">Shi'ism</a>. Mu'tazilis espoused the view that the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> was <a href="Quranic%20createdness">created</a> and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided "<a href="imam">imām</a>" to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering <a href="Ali">Ali</a>, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the <a href="First%20Fitna">conflict</a> between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the "<a href="mihna">miḥna</a>". During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played an active role in the enforcement of the "miḥna" in the western provinces; this continued after his accession. The chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head "<a href="qadi">qādī</a>" <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Abi%20Duwad">Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad</a>, was perhaps the dominant influence at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.

Thus Mu'tazilism became closely identified with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim. Adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose the authority of the Caliph as the God-sanctioned "imām". While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal <a href="revelation">word of God</a>. Opposition to Mu'tazilism also provided a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was unsuccessful, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment of one of the most resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Hanbal">Ahmad ibn Hanbal</a>, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative <a href="Hanbali">Hanbali</a> school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence ("<a href="fiqh">fiqh</a>") in <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>.

Although al-Mu'tasim's reign was a time of peace in the Caliphate's heartland territories, al-Mu'tasim himself was an energetic campaigner, and according to Kennedy "acquired the reputation of being one of the warrior-caliphs of Islam". With the exception of the Amorium campaign, most of the military expeditions of al-Mu'tasim's reign were domestic, directed against rebels in areas that, although nominally part of the Caliphate, had remained outside effective Muslim rule and where native peoples and princes retained "de facto" autonomy. The three great campaigns of the reign—Amorium, the expedition against the Khurramite rebellion, and that against Mazyar, ruler of Tabaristan—were in part also conscious propaganda exercises, in which al-Mu'tasim could solidify his regime's legitimacy in the eyes of the populace by leading wars against infidels.

An Alid revolt led by <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Qasim%20%28al-Alawi%29">Muhammad ibn Qasim</a> broke out in Khurasan in early 834, but was swiftly defeated and Muhammad brought as a prisoner to the Caliph's court. He managed to escape during the night of 8/9October 834, taking advantage of the <a href="Eid%20al-Fitr">Eid al-Fitr</a> festivities, and was never heard of again. In June/July of the same year, Ujayf ibn 'Anbasa was sent to subdue the <a href="Zutt">Zutt</a>. These were people who had been brought from <a href="India">India</a> by the <a href="Sassanid">Sassanid</a> emperors and settled in the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Marshes">Mesopotamian Marshes</a>. The Zutt had been in rebellion against caliphal authority since , and had frequently raided the environs of <a href="Basra">Basra</a> and <a href="Wasit">Wasit</a>. After a seven-month campaign, Ujayf was successful in encircling the Zutt and forcing them to surrender. He made a triumphal entry into Baghdad in January 835 with numerous captives. Many of the Zutt were then sent to <a href="Ayn%20Zarba">Ayn Zarba</a> on the Byzantine frontier, to fight against the Byzantines.
The first major campaign of the new reign was directed against the <a href="Khurramites">Khurramites</a> in <a href="Adharbayjan">Adharbayjan</a> and <a href="Arran%20%28Caucasus%29">Arran</a>. The Khurramite revolt had been active since 816/7, aided by the inaccessible mountains of the province and the absence of large Arab Muslim population centres, except for a few cities in the lowlands. Al-Ma'mun had left the local Muslims largely to their own devices. A succession of military commanders attempted to subdue the rebellion on their own initiative, and thus gain control of the country's newly discovered mineral resources, only to be defeated by the Khurramites under the capable leadership of Babak. Immediately after his accession, al-Mu'tasim sent the Tahirid "<a href="sahib%20al-shurta">ṣāḥib al-shurṭa</a>" of Baghdad and Samarra, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, to deal with an expansion of the Khurramite rebellion from <a href="Jibal">Jibal</a> into <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>. Ishaq swiftly achieved success, and by December 833 had suppressed the rebellion, forcing many Khurramites to seek refuge in the Byzantine Empire. In 835 al-Mu'tasim took action against Babak, assigning his trusted and capable lieutenant, al-Afshin, to command the campaign. After three years of cautious and methodical campaigning, al-Afshin was able to capture Babak at his capital of Budhdh on 26August 837, extinguishing the rebellion. Babak was brought captive to Samarra, where, on3 January 838, he was paraded before the people seated on an elephant, and then publicly executed.

Shortly after, <a href="Mankjur%20al-Farghani">Minkajur al-Ushrusani</a>, whom al-Afshin had appointed as governor of Adharbayjan after the defeat of the Khurramites, rose in revolt, either because he had been involved in financial irregularities, or because he had been a co-conspirator of al-Afshin's. Bugha the Elder marched against him, forcing him to capitulate and receive a safe-passage to Samarra in 840.

The second major domestic campaign of the reign began in 838, against Mazyar, the autonomous <a href="Qarinid">Qarinid</a> ruler of Tabaristan. Tabaristan had been subjected to Abbasid authority in 760, but Muslim presence was limited to the coastal lowlands of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> and their cities. The mountainous areas remained under native rulers—chief among whom were the <a href="Bavandids">Bavandids</a> in the eastern and the Qarinids in the central and western mountain ranges—who retained their autonomy in exchange for paying a tribute to the Caliphate. With the support of al-Ma'mun, Mazyar had established himself as the "de facto" ruler of all Tabaristan, even capturing the Muslim city of <a href="Amol">Amul</a> and imprisoning the local Abbasid governor. Al-Mu'tasim confirmed him in his post on his accession, but trouble soon began when Mazyar refused to accept his subordination to the Tahirid viceroy of the east, Abdallah ibn Tahir, instead insisting on paying the taxes of his region directly to al-Mu'tasim's agent. According to al-Tabari, the Qarinid's intransigence had been secretly encouraged by al-Afshin, who hoped to discredit the Tahirids and assume their vast governorship in the east himself.

Tension mounted as the Tahirids encouraged the local Muslims to resist Mazyar, forcing the latter to adopt an increasingly confrontational stance against the Muslim settlers and turn for support on the native Iranian, and mostly <a href="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a>, peasantry, whom he encouraged to attack the Muslim landowners. Open conflict erupted in 838, when his troops seized the cities of Amul and <a href="Sari%2C%20Iran">Sari</a>, took the Muslim settlers prisoner, and executed many of them. In return, the Tahirids under <a href="al-Hasan%20ibn%20al-Husayn%20ibn%20Mus%27ab">al-Hasan ibn al-Husayn ibn Mus'ab</a> and <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Ibrahim%20al-Mus%27abi">Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab</a> invaded Tabaristan. Mazyar was betrayed by his brother <a href="Quhyar">Quhyar</a>, who also revealed to the Tahirids the correspondence between Mazyar and al-Afshin. Quhyar then succeeded his brother as a Tahirid appointee, while Mazyar was taken captive to Samarra. Like Babak, he was paraded before the populace, and then flogged to death, on 6September 840. While the autonomy of the local dynasties was maintained in the aftermath of the revolt, the event marked the onset of the country's rapid Islamization, including among the native dynasties.

Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there were a series of uprisings in the Syrian provinces, including the revolt by Abu Harb, known as <a href="al-Mubarqa">al-Mubarqa</a> or "the Veiled One", which brought to the fore the lingering pro-<a href="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> sentiment of several Syrian Arabs.

Taking advantage of the Abbasids' preoccupation with the suppression of the Khurramite rebellion, the Byzantine emperor Theophilos had launched attacks on the Muslim frontier zone in the early 830s, and scored several successes. His forces were bolstered by some 14,000 Khurramites who fled into the Empire, became baptized and enrolled in the Byzantine army under the command of their leader Nasr, better known by his Christian name <a href="Theophobos">Theophobos</a>. In 837, Theophilos, urged by the increasingly hard-pressed Babak, launched a major campaign into the Muslim frontier lands. He led a large army, reportedly numbering over 70,000 men, in an almost unopposed invasion of the region around the upper <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. The Byzantines took the towns of <a href="Zibatra">Zibatra</a> (Sozopetra) and <a href="Arsamosata">Arsamosata</a>, ravaged and plundered the countryside, extracted ransom from <a href="Malatya">Malatya</a> and other cities in exchange for not attacking them, and defeated several smaller Arab forces. As refugees began arriving at Samarra, the caliphal court was outraged by the brutality and brazenness of the raids; not only had the Byzantines acted in open collusion with the Khurramites, but during the sack of Zibatra all male prisoners were executed and the rest of the population sold into slavery, and some captive women were raped by Theophilos' Khurramites.

The Caliph took personal charge of preparations for a retaliatory expedition, as the campaigns against Byzantium were customarily the only ones in which caliphs participated in person. Al-Mu'tasim assembled a huge force—80,000 men with 30,000 servants and camp followers according to <a href="Michael%20the%20Syrian">Michael the Syrian</a>, or even larger according to other writers—at <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a>. He declared his target to be <a href="Amorium">Amorium</a>, the birthplace of the reigning Byzantine dynasty. The Caliph reportedly had the name painted on the shields and banners of his army. The campaign began in June, with a smaller force under al-Afshin attacking through the Pass of <a href="Hadath">Hadath</a> in the east, while the Caliph with the main army crossed the Cilician Gates on 19–21June. Theophilos, who had been caught unaware by the two-pronged Abbasid attack, tried to confront al-Afshin's smaller force first, but suffered a major defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dazimon">Battle of Dazimon</a> on 22July, barely escaping with his life. Unable to offer any effective resistance to the Abbasid advance, the Emperor returned to Constantinople. A week later, al-Afshin and the main caliphal army joined forces before <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a>, which had been left defenceless and was plundered.

From Ancyra, the Abbasid army turned to Amorium, to which they laid siege on 1August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was fiercely contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach in a weak spot of the wall. After two weeks, taking advantage of a short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army successfully stormed the city. It was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim was now considering extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, stationed in nearby <a href="Dorylaion">Dorylaion</a>. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the Caliph's army and its prisoners suffered during the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, while others found in the turmoil the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000.

The sack of Amorium brought al-Mu'tasim much acclaim as a warrior-caliph and "<a href="Ghazi%20%28warrior%29">ghāzī</a>" (warrior for the faith), and was celebrated by contemporaries, most notably in a famous ode by the court poet <a href="Abu%20Tammam">Abu Tammam</a>. The Abbasids did not follow up on their success. Warfare continued between the two empires with raids and counter-raids along the border, but after a few Byzantine successes a truce was agreed in 841. At the time of his death in 842, al-Mu'tasim was preparing yet another large-scale invasion, but the great fleet he had prepared to assault Constantinople was destroyed in a storm off <a href="Cape%20Chelidonia">Cape Chelidonia</a> a few months later. Following al-Mu'tasim's death, warfare gradually died down, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mauropotamos">Battle of Mauropotamos</a> in 844 was the last major Arab–Byzantine engagement for a decade.

Al-Tabari states that al-Mu'tasim fell ill on 21October 841. His regular physician, Salmawayh ibn Bunan, whom the Caliph had trusted implicitly, had died the previous year. His new physician, Yahya ibn Masawayh, did not follow the normal treatment of <a href="cupping%20therapy">cupping</a> and <a href="Colon%20cleansing">purging</a>. According to Hunayn ibn Ishaq this worsened the caliph's illness and brought about his death on 5January 842, after a reign of eight years, eight months and two days according to the <a href="Islamic%20calendar">Islamic calendar</a>. He was buried in the <a href="Jawsaq%20al-Khaqani">Jawsaq al-Khaqani</a> palace in Samarra. The succession of his son, al-Wathiq, was unopposed. Al-Wathiq's reign, through unremarkable, was essentially a continuation of al-Mu'tasim's own, as the government continued to be led by the men al-Mu'tasim had raised to power: the Turks Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas; the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat; and the chief "qādī" Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad.

Al-Tabari describes al-Mu'tasim as having a relatively easygoing nature, being kind, agreeable and charitable. According to C. E. Bosworth the sources reveal little about al-Mu'tasim's character, other than his lack of sophistication compared with his half-brother. Nevertheless, Bosworth concludes, he was a proficient military commander who secured the caliphate both politically and militarily.

Al-Mu'tasim's reign represents a watershed moment in the history of the Abbasid state, and had long-lasting repercussions in Islamic history. While the early Abbasid regime already relied heavily on non-Arab elements—the Khurasanis who had formed the bulk of the Abbasid Revolutions' military forces, and the Persian and <a href="Syriacs">Syriac</a> <a href="Katib">secretarial</a> class that had emerged in Baghdad and Iraq to staff the Abbasid administration—al-Mu'tasim's military reforms are truly "the moment when the Arabs lost control of the empire they created", according to Kennedy, while according to <a href="David%20Ayalon">David Ayalon</a>, the institution of military slavery introduced by al-Mu'tasim became "one of the most important and most enduring socio-political institutions that Islam has known". With his Turkish guard, al-Mu'tasim set a pattern that would be widely imitated: not only did the military acquire a predominant position in the state, but it also increasingly became the preserve of minority groups from the peoples living on the margins of the Islamic world. Thus it formed an exclusive ruling caste, separated from the Arab-Iranian mainstream of society by ethnic origin, language, and sometimes even religion. This dichotomy would become, according to Hugh Kennedy, a "distinctive feature" of many Islamic polities, and would reach its apogee in the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluk dynasties</a> that ruled Egypt and Syria in the late Middle Ages.

More immediately, although al-Mu'tasim's new professional army proved militarily highly effective, it also posed a potential danger to the stability of the Abbasid regime, as the army's separation from mainstream society meant that the soldiers were entirely reliant on the "ʿaṭāʾ" for survival. Consequently, any failure to provide their pay, or policies that threatened their position, were likely to cause a violent reaction. This became evident less than a generation later, during the "<a href="Anarchy%20at%20Samarra">Anarchy at Samarra</a>" (861–870), where the Turks played the main role. The need to cover military spending would henceforth be a fixture of caliphal government. This was at a time when government income began to decline rapidly—partly through the rise of autonomous dynasties in the provinces and partly through the decline in productivity of the lowlands of Iraq that had traditionally provided the bulk of tax revenue. Less than a century after al-Mu'tasim's death, this process would lead to the bankruptcy of the Abbasid government and the eclipse of the caliphs' political power with the rise of the <a href="Khazar">Khazar</a> officer <a href="Ibn%20Ra%27iq">Ibn Ra'iq</a> to the position of "<a href="amir%20al-umara">amīr al-umarāʾ</a>".

Al-Mu'tasim is featured in the medieval Arabic and Turkish epic "<a href="Delhemma">Delhemma</a>", which features heavily fictionalized versions of events from the Arab–Byzantine wars. In it, al-Mu'tasim helps the heroes pursue the traitor and apostate Uqba across several countries "from Spain to Yemen", before having him crucified before Constantinople. On its return, the Muslim army is ambushed in a defile by the Byzantines, and only 400 men, including the Caliph and most of the heroes, manage to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim's successor al-Wathiq launches a campaign against Constantinople, where he installs a Muslim governor.

The name al-Mu'tasim is used for a fictional character in the story "<a href="The%20Approach%20to%20al-Mu%27tasim">The Approach to al-Mu'tasim</a>", written in 1936 by <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> author <a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, which appears in his anthology "<a href="Ficciones">Ficciones</a>". The al-Mu'tasim referenced there is not the Abbasid caliph, though Borges does state, regarding the original, non-fictional al-Mu'tasim from whom the name is taken: "the name of that eighth Abbasid caliph who was victorious in eight battles, fathered eight sons and eight daughters, left eight thousand slaves, and ruled for a period of eight years, eight moons, and eight days".

While not strictly accurate, Borges' quote paraphrases al-Tabari, who notes that he was "born in the eighth month, was the eighth caliph, in the eighth generation from <a href="Al-%E2%80%98Abbas%20ibn%20%E2%80%98Abd%20al-Muttalib">al-‘Abbas</a>, his lifespan was eight and forty years, that he died leaving eight sons and eight daughters, and that he reigned for eight years and eight months", and reflects the widespread reference to al-Mu'tasim in Arabic sources as "al-Muthamman" ("the man of eight").

Cragside

Cragside is a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> <a href="country%20house">country house</a> near the town of <a href="Rothbury">Rothbury</a> in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. It was the home of <a href="William%20Armstrong%2C%201st%20Baron%20Armstrong">William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong</a>, founder of the <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> armaments firm. An industrial <a href="magnate">magnate</a>, scientist, philanthropist and inventor of the <a href="hydraulic%20crane">hydraulic crane</a> and the <a href="Armstrong%20gun">Armstrong gun</a>, Armstrong also displayed his inventiveness in the domestic sphere, making Cragside the first house in the world to be lit using <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> power. The entire estate was technologically advanced; the architect of the house, <a href="Richard%20Norman%20Shaw">Richard Norman Shaw</a>, wrote that it was equipped with "wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things". In the grounds, Armstrong built dams and created lakes to power a sawmill, a water-powered laundry, early versions of a dishwasher and a <a href="dumb%20waiter">dumb waiter</a>, a hydraulic <a href="elevator">lift</a> and a hydroelectric <a href="rotisserie">rotisserie</a>. In 1887, Armstrong was raised to the <a href="Peerages%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">peerage</a>, the first engineer or scientist to be ennobled. He took his title from the name of his house, to become Baron Armstrong, of Cragside. 

The original building was a small shooting lodge which Armstrong built between 1862 and 1864. In 1869, he employed the architect Richard Norman Shaw to enlarge Cragside. In two phases of work between 1869 and 1882, they transformed the house into a northern <a href="Neuschwanstein">Neuschwanstein</a>. The result was described by the architect and writer <a href="Harry%20Stuart%20Goodhart-Rendel">Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel</a> as "one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture". Armstrong filled the house with a significant art collection; he and his wife were patrons of many <a href="Victorian%20painting">19th-century British artists</a>. Cragside became an integral part of Armstrong's commercial operations: honoured guests under Armstrong's roof, including the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Shah of Persia</a>, the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Thailand">King of Siam</a> and two future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan">Prime Ministers of Japan</a>, were also customers for his commercial undertakings.

Following Armstrong's death in 1900, his heirs struggled to maintain the house and estate. In 1910, the best of Armstrong's art collection was sold off, and by the 1970s, in an attempt to meet <a href="inheritance%20tax">inheritance tax</a>, plans were submitted for large-scale residential development of the estate. In 1971 the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> asked the architectural historian <a href="Mark%20Girouard">Mark Girouard</a> to compile a gazetteer of the most important Victorian houses in Britain which the Trust should seek to save should they ever be sold. Girouard placed Cragside at the top of the list; in 1977, the house was acquired by the Trust with the aid of a grant from the <a href="National%20Land%20Fund">National Land Fund</a>. A <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a> since 1953, Cragside has been open to the public since 1979.

William Armstrong was born on 26 November 1810 in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, the son of a corn merchant. Trained as a solicitor, he moved to London before he was twenty. Returning to Newcastle, in 1835 he met and married Margaret Ramshaw, the daughter of a builder. A keen amateur scientist, Armstrong began to conduct experiments in both hydraulics and electricity. In 1847, he abandoned the law for manufacturing and established <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">W. G. Armstrong and Company</a> at a site at <a href="Elswick%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Elswick</a>, outside Newcastle. By the 1850s, with his design for the <a href="Armstrong%20Gun">Armstrong Gun</a>, Armstrong laid the foundations for an armaments firm that would, before the end of the century, see <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> as its only world rival. He established himself as a figure of national standing: his work supplying artillery to the British Army was seen as an important response to the failures of Britain's forces during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. In 1859, he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> and made Engineer of Rifled Ordnance, becoming the principal supplier of armaments to both the <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Navy</a>.

Armstrong had spent much of his childhood at <a href="Rothbury">Rothbury</a>, escaping from industrial Newcastle for the benefit of his often poor health. He returned to the area in 1862, not having taken a holiday for over fifteen years. On a walk with friends, Armstrong was struck by the attractiveness of the site for a house. Returning to Newcastle, he bought a small parcel of land and decided to build a modest house on the side of a moorland crag. He intended a house of eight or ten rooms and a stable for a pair of horses. The house was completed in the mid-1860s by an unknown architect: a two-storey <a href="Hunting%20and%20shooting%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Hunting%20lodge">shooting box</a> of little architectural distinction, it was nevertheless constructed and furnished to a high standard.

Armstrong's architect for Cragside's expansion was the Scot <a href="R.%20Norman%20Shaw">R. Norman Shaw</a>. Shaw had begun his career in the office of <a href="William%20Burn">William Burn</a> and had later studied under <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> and <a href="George%20Edmund%20Street">George Edmund Street</a>. Salvin had taught him the mastery of internal planning which was essential for the design of the large and highly variegated houses which the Victorian wealthy craved. Salvin and Street had taught him to understand the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a>. At only 24, he won the <a href="RIBA">RIBA</a> Gold Medal and Travelling Studentship. The connection between Armstrong and Shaw was made when Armstrong purchased a picture, "Prince Hal taking the crown from his father's bedside" by <a href="John%20Callcott%20Horsley">John Callcott Horsley</a>, which proved too large to fit into his town house in <a href="Jesmond">Jesmond</a>, Newcastle. Horsley, a friend of both, recommended that Shaw design an extension to the banqueting hall Armstrong had previously built in the grounds. When this was completed in 1869, Shaw was asked to propose enlargements and improvements to the shooting lodge Armstrong had had built at Rothbury some four years earlier. This was the genesis of the transformation of the house between 1869 and 1884. Over the next thirty years, Cragside became the centre of Armstrong's world; reminiscing years later, in his old age, he remarked, "had there been no Cragside, I shouldn't be talking to you todayfor it has been my very life".

The architectural historian <a href="Andrew%20Saint">Andrew Saint</a> records that Shaw sketched out the whole design for the "future fairy palace" in a single afternoon, while Armstrong and his guests were out on a shooting party. After this rapid initial design, Shaw worked on building the house for over 20 years. The long building period, and Armstrong's piecemeal, and changeable, approach to the development of the house, and his desire to retain the original shooting lodge at its core, occasionally led to tensions between client and architect, and to a building that lacks an overall unity. Armstrong changed the purpose of several rooms as his interests developed, and the German architectural historian <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a>, writing just after Armstrong's death in 1900, noted that "the house did not find the unqualified favour with Shaw's followers that his previous works had done, nor did it entirely satisfy (Shaw)". Nevertheless, Shaw's abilities, as an architect and as a manager of difficult clients, ensured that Cragside was composed "with memorable force".
As well as being Armstrong's home, Cragside acted as an enormous display case for his ever-expanding art collection. The best of his pictures were hung in the drawing room, but Shaw also converted the museum into a top-lit picture gallery. Pride of place was given to <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>'s "Chill October", bought by Armstrong at the <a href="Samuel%20Mendel">Samuel Mendel</a> sale at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> in 1875. Armstrong also bought Millais' "Jephthah's Daughter" at the Mendel sale. Both were sold in the 1910 sale; "Chill October" is now in the private collection of <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>, and "Jephthah's Daughter" is held by the <a href="National%20Museum%20Cardiff">National Museum Cardiff</a>.

Cragside was also an important setting for Armstrong's commercial activities. The architectural writer <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> records: "Japanese, Persian, Siamese and German dignitaries paid court to the man who equipped their armies and built their navies". In his 2005 book "Landmarks of Britain" <a href="Clive%20Aslet">Clive Aslet</a> notes visits with the same purpose from the <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Afghanistan">Crown Prince of Afghanistan</a> and the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Shah of Persia</a>. The Shah <a href="Naser%20al-Din%20Shah%20Qajar">Naser al-Din</a> visited in July 1889, and the Afghan prince <a href="Nasrullah%20Khan%20%28Afghanistan%29">Nasrullah Khan</a> in June 1895. Armstrong's biographer Henrietta Heald mentions two future Prime Ministers of Japan, <a href="Kat%C5%8D%20Takaaki">Katō Takaaki</a> and <a href="Sait%C5%8D%20Makoto">Saitō Makoto</a>, among a steady stream of Japanese industrialists, naval officers, politicians and royalty who inscribed their names in the Cragside visitors' book. The Chinese diplomat <a href="Li%20Hung%20Chang">Li Hung Chang</a> visited in August 1896. King <a href="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</a> of Siam was staying in August 1897, when activity at the Elswick Works was disrupted by a bitter <a href="strike%20action">strike</a> over pay and hours.

In August 1884 the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince</a> and <a href="Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess</a> of Wales (the future <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Queen Alexandra</a>) made a three-day visit to Cragside; it was the peak of Armstrong's social career. The royal arrival at the house was illuminated by ten thousand lamps and a vast array of <a href="Paper%20lantern">Chinese lanterns</a> hung in the trees on the estate; fireworks were launched from six balloons, and a great bonfire was lit on the <a href="Simonside%20Hills">Simonside Hills</a>. On the second day of their visit, the Prince and Princess travelled to Newcastle, to formally open the grounds of Armstrong's old house, Jesmond Dean, which he had by then donated to the city as a public park. Three years later, at the <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria</a>, Armstrong was ennobled as Baron Armstrong of Cragside, and became the first engineer and the first scientist to be granted a peerage. Among many other celebrations, he was awarded the freedom of the City of Newcastle. In his vote of thanks, the mayor noted that one in four of the entire population of the city was employed directly by Armstrong, or by companies over which he presided.

Armstrong died at Cragside on 27 December 1900, aged 90, and was buried beside his wife in the churchyard at Rothbury. His gravestone carries an epitaph: "His scientific attainments gained him a world wide celebrity and his great philanthropy the gratitude of the poor". Cragside, and Armstrong's fortune, were inherited by his great-nephew, <a href="William%20Watson-Armstrong%2C%201st%20Baron%20Armstrong">William Watson-Armstrong</a>. Watson-Armstrong lacked Armstrong's commercial acumen and a series of poor financial investments led to the sale of much of the great art collection in 1910. In 1972, the death of Watson-Armstrong's heir, William John Montagu Watson-Armstrong, saw the house and estate threatened by large-scale residential development, intended to raise the money to pay a large <a href="inheritance%20tax">inheritance tax</a> bill. In 1971, when advising the National Trust on the most important Victorian houses to be preserved for the nation in the event of their sale, Mark Girouard had identified Cragside as the top priority. A major campaign saw the house and grounds acquired by the Trust in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the <a href="National%20Land%20Fund">National Land Fund</a>.

In 2007, Cragside reopened after undergoing an 18-month refurbishment programme that included rewiring the whole house. It has become one of the most-visited sites in <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>, with some 227,062 visitors in 2016. The Trust continues restoration work, allowing more of the house to be displayed: Armstrong's electrical room, in which he conducted experiments on electrical charges towards the end of his life, was re-opened in 2016. The experiments had led to the publication in 1897 of Armstrong's last work, "Electrical Movement in Air and Water", illustrated with remarkable early photographs by his friend John Worsnop.

The Trust continues the reconstruction of the wider estate, with plans to redevelop Armstrong's glasshouses, including the palm house, the ferneries and the orchid house.

Cragside is an example of Shaw's <a href="Tudor%20Revival%20architecture">Tudor revival</a> style; the <a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Pevsner Architectural Guide</a> for Northumberland called it "the most dramatic <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> mansion in the <a href="Northern%20England">North of England</a>". The entrance front was described by <a href="Harry%20Stuart%20Goodhart-Rendel">Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel</a> as "one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture", and the architectural historian <a href="James%20Stevens%20Curl">James Stevens Curl</a> regarded the house as "an extraordinarily accomplished <a href="Picturesque">Picturesque</a> composition". Criticism focuses on the building's lack of overall coherence; in "The National Trust Book of the English House," Aslet and Powers describe the house as "large and meandering", and the architectural critics Dixon and Muthesius write that "the plan rambles along the hillside". Saint is even more dismissive: for him, "the plan of Cragside is little better than a straggle". The <a href="Timber%20framing">half-timbering</a> above the entrance has also been criticised as unfaithful to the <a href="vernacular%20architecture">vernacular</a> tradition of the North-East. Shaw would have been unconcerned; desiring it for "romantic effect, he reached out for it like an artist reaching out for a tube of colour".

The architectural historian <a href="J.%20Mordaunt%20Crook">J. Mordaunt Crook</a> considers Cragside to be one of the very few country houses built by the Victorian commercial <a href="plutocracy">plutocracy</a> that was truly "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> or trend-setting". In his study, "The Rise of the Nouveaux Riches", Crook contends that many new-monied owners were too domineering, and generally chose second-rate architects, as these tended to be more "pliant", allowing the clients to get their own way, rather than those of the first rank such as Shaw. The <a href="Rhineland">Rhenish</a> flavour of the house makes a notable contrast with a country house that was almost contemporaneous with Cragside: the <a href="Villa%20H%C3%BCgel">Villa Hügel</a> constructed by Armstrong's greatest rival, Alfred Krupp. While Armstrong's Northumbrian fastness drew on <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Teutonic</a> inspirations, his German competitor designed and built a house that was an exercise in <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassicism</a>.

The location for the house was described by Mark Girouard as "a lunatic site". Pevsner and Richmond call both the setting and the house Wagnerian. The ledge on which it stands is narrow, and space for the repeated expansions could only be found by dynamiting the rock face behind, or by building upwards. Such challenges only drove Armstrong on, and overcoming the technical barriers to construction gave him great pleasure. His task was made easier by the use of the workforce and the technology of the Elswick Works. The architectural historian Jill Franklin notes that the vertiginous fall of the site is so steep that the drawing room, on a level with the first-floor landing at the front of the house, meets the rock face at the back.

Jenkins describes the plan of the house as "simpler than the exterior suggests". The majority of the reception rooms are located on the ground floor, as are the accompanying service rooms. The exception is the large extension Shaw added to the south-east from 1882. This includes the drawing room, completed for the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, in August 1884.

The house has been a <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a> since 21 October 1953, the listing citing "inter alia" its "largely complete Victorian interior". The architectural correspondent of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", <a href="Marcus%20Binney">Marcus Binney</a>, who was closely involved in the campaign to bring Cragside to the National Trust, noted the historic importance of this "virtually untouched interior", with its collections of furnishings, furniture (much designed especially for Cragside), and fine and decorative arts, with work by many notable designers of the period, including <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a>, <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, <a href="Philip%20Webb">Philip Webb</a> and <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>. Pevsner notes that the art collection demonstrated "what was permissible to the Victorian nobleman in the way of <a href="erotica">erotica</a>".

The kitchen is large by Victorian standards and forms a considerable apartment with the butler's pantry. It displays Armstrong's "technical ingenuity" to the full, having a <a href="dumb%20waiter">dumb waiter</a> and a <a href="Rotisserie">spit</a> both run on hydraulic power. An electric gong announced mealtimes. For the visit of Edward and Alexandra, Armstrong brought in the Royal caterers, Gunters, who used the kitchen to prepare an eight-course menu which included oysters, <a href="turtle%20soup">turtle soup</a>, stuffed <a href="turbot">turbot</a>, venison, grouse, peaches in <a href="maraschino">maraschino</a> jelly and brown bread ice cream. Off the kitchen, under the library, is a <a href="Turkish%20bath">Turkish bath</a> suite, an unusual item in a Victorian private house. The writer Michael Hall suggests that the bath, with its plunge pool, was intended as much to demonstrate Armstrong's copious water supply as for actual use. As was often the case, Armstrong also found practical application for his pleasures: steam generated by the Turkish bath supported the provision of heating for the house.

Girouard describes the library as "one of the most sympathetic Victorian rooms in England". It belongs to the first phase of Shaw's construction work and was completed in 1872. It has a large <a href="bay%20window">bay window</a> which gives views out over the bridge and the glen. The room is half-panelled in oak and the fireplace includes fragments of Egyptian <a href="onyx">onyx</a>, collected during Armstrong's visit to the country in 1872. The library originally contained some of Armstrong's best pictures, although most were rehung in the gallery or drawing room, following Shaw's later building campaign of the 1880s, and then sold in 1910, ten years after Armstrong's death. The highlight was <a href="Albert%20Joseph%20Moore">Albert Joseph Moore's</a> "Follow My Leader", dating from 1872. Andrew Saint considers the room "Shaw's greatest domestic interior". The dining room off the library contains a "Gothic" fireplace with an <a href="inglenook">inglenook</a>.

A portrait of Armstrong by <a href="Henry%20Hetherington%20Emmerson">Henry Hetherington Emmerson</a> shows him sitting in the inglenook with his dogs, under a carved inscription on the mantlepiece reading "East or West, <a href="wikt%3Ahame%23Scots">Hame's</a> Best". The stained glass in the windows of the inglenook is by William Morris, and other glass from <a href="Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Morris & Co.</a>, to designs by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Webb and <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Brown">Ford Madox Brown</a>, was installed in the library, gallery and upper stairs.

The Owl rooms were constructed in the first building campaign and formed a suite for important guests. Their name derives from the carved owls that decorate the woodwork and the bed. The room is panelled in <a href="Juglans%20nigra">American Black walnut</a>, the same wood from which the <a href="Four-poster%20bed">tester</a> bed is carved. Saint notes that Shaw was "proud of the design", displaying a further "owl-bed" in an exhibition in 1877. The Prince and Princess of Wales occupied the rooms during their stay at Cragside in 1884. Other bedrooms, notably the Yellow and White rooms, were hung with wallpaper by William Morris, including early versions of his "Fruit" and "Bird and Trellis" designs. The wallpapers were reprinted using the original <a href="Woodblock%20printing">printing blocks</a> and rehung in the National Trust's renovations.

The gallery originally formed Armstrong's museum room and was built by Shaw between 1872 and 1874. It led to the observatory in the Gilnockie Tower. Later, the room formed a processional route to the newly created drawing room, and was transformed into a gallery for pictures and sculpture. Its lighting displayed further evidence of Armstrong's technical ingenuity. Provided with twelve overhead lamps, the lighting for the room could be supplemented by a further eight lamps, powered by electric current transferred from the lamps in the dining room when they were no longer required. Lighting, and his means of providing it, mattered to Armstrong, on both technical and aesthetic levels; he wrote, "in the passageways and stairs the lamps are used without shades and present a most beautiful and star-like appearance."

The drawing room was constructed in the 1880s phase of building, when Armstrong had sold his Jesmond house and was residing solely at Cragside. Aslet suggests that the inspiration for the design was the <a href="great%20hall">great hall</a> at <a href="Haddon%20Hall">Haddon Hall</a>, <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, although Saint considers Shaw's <a href="Dawpool%20%28house%29">Dawpool Hall</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> as the more likely source. Pevsner and Richmond mention <a href="Hardwick%20Hall">Hardwick Hall</a> and <a href="Hatfield%20House">Hatfield House</a> as possible models for the "spectacular" overall design. The room contains a colossal marble inglenook <a href="Fireplace%20mantel">chimneypiece</a>, reputed to weigh ten tons, and designed by Shaw's assistant, <a href="William%20Lethaby">W. R. Lethaby</a>. Muthesius describes the fireplace as a "splendid example ... with finely composed relief decoration". Jenkins considers it "surely the world's biggest inglenook" and describes the overall impact of the room as "sensational", noting the top-lit ceiling and the elaborate <a href="Jacobethan">Jacobethan</a> <a href="plasterwork">plasterwork</a>. Others have been less complimentary; the writer Reginald Turnor, no admirer either of Shaw or of Victorian architecture and its architects more generally, wrote of the room's "flamboyant and rather sickening detail". By the time of its construction, Shaw, increasingly working for clients of great wealth, had moved on from his "Old English" style, and the room is designed and decorated in a grander and more opulent <a href="Renaissance%20Revival%20architecture">Renaissance</a> taste.

The billiard room extension of 1895 is by Frederick Waller. It replaced a laboratory, in which Armstrong conducted experiments in electric currents. The billiard table and furniture was supplied by Burroughes and Watts. The billiard room and adjacent gun room formed a smoking suite, the previous absence of which is evidenced in a watercolour painted to commemorate the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Prince and Armstrong are shown smoking cigars on the terrace, as Victorian convention did not permit smoking in the principal reception rooms.

After his first visit in 1869, Shaw described the house in a letter to his wife, noting the "wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things you can imagine". By building dams, Armstrong created five new lakes on the estate, Debdon, Tumbleton, Blackburn, and the Upper and Lower lakes at Nelly's Moss. In 1868, a <a href="hydraulic">hydraulic</a> engine was installed. Inspired by a watermill on the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Cumbria">Dee</a> in <a href="Dentdale">Dentdale</a>, in 1870 Armstrong installed a <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens</a> <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a> in what was the world's first <a href="hydroelectric%20power%20station">hydroelectric power station</a>. The generators, which also provided power for the farm buildings on the estate, were constantly extended and improved to meet the increasing electrical demands in the house. The 2006 regeneration project included extensive rewiring. A new <a href="screw%20turbine">screw turbine</a> was installed in 2014; it can provide 12 kW, supplying around 10 per cent of the property's electricity consumption. The new system uses a -long <a href="Archimedes%27%20screw">Archimedes' screw</a>.

The electricity generated was used to power an <a href="arc%20lamp">arc lamp</a> installed in the picture gallery in 1878. This was replaced in 1880 by <a href="Joseph%20Swan">Joseph Swan</a>'s <a href="incandescent%20lamp">incandescent lamp</a>s in what Swan considered "the first proper installation" of electric lighting. Armstrong knew Swan well and had chaired the presentation of Swan's new lamps to the <a href="Literary%20and%20Philosophical%20Society%20of%20Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> describes Cragside as the "first (house) in the world to be lit by electricity derived from water power". The use of electricity to run the house's appliances and internal systems made Cragside a pioneer of <a href="home%20automation">home automation</a>; one of the first private residences to have a dishwasher, a vacuum cleaner and a washing machine, the conservators Sarah Schmitz and Caroline Rawson suggest Cragside was "the place where modern living began". The spit in the kitchen was also powered by hydraulics. The conservatory contained a self-watering system for the pot plants, which turned on water-powered revolving stands. Telephony was introduced, both between the rooms in the house, and between the house and other buildings on the estate. A plaque at <a href="Bamburgh%20Castle">Bamburgh Castle</a>, Armstrong's other residence on the Northumbrian coast, records that his development of these new automated technologies "emancipated ... much of the world from household drudgery".

Cragside is named after "Cragend Hill" above the house, and is surrounded by an extensive <a href="rock%20garden">rock garden</a>, with a collection of <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>s, one of which is named after Lady Armstrong, who made a considerable contribution to the design and construction of the gardens, and large plantings of mostly <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous trees. Among these is the tallest <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a> in Britain, at a height of 131ft (40m). Over one hundred years after their planting, Jill Franklin wrote that, "the great, dark trees form a protective barrier to (Armstrong's) home". Armstrong continued to buy land after the purchase of the original site and by the 1880s the gardens and grounds comprised some 1,700 acres, with the wider estate, including Armstrong's agricultural holdings, extending to 15,000 acres according to Henrietta Heald's 2012 biography of Armstrong, and to over 16,000 acres according to the historian <a href="David%20Cannadine">David Cannadine</a>. David Dougan records the traditional claim that Armstrong planted over seven million trees in the gardens and parkland. The estate is a sanctuary for some of the last remaining <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a> colonies in England.

The glen north-west of the house is spanned by an iron bridge, crossing the Debdon Burn, constructed to Armstrong's design at his <a href="Elswick%20Ordnance%20Company">Elswick Works</a> in the 1870s. It is a <a href="listed%20building">Grade II* listed structure</a> and was restored by the Trust, and reopened to the public in 2008–2009. The gardens themselves are listed Grade I, and some of the architectural and technological structures have their own historic listings. The Clock Tower, which regulated life on the estate, dates from the time of the construction of the shooting lodge, and might have been designed by the same architect; it is not by Shaw. It is possible that Armstrong himself designed the clock. Like the bridge, the Clock Tower has a Grade II* listing. The formal gardens, where Armstrong's great greenhouses stood and which were long separated from the main estate, have now been acquired by the Trust.

Cragside has featured in an <a href="Open%20University">Open University</a> Arts Foundation Course, <a href="Jonathan%20Meades">Jonathan Meades's</a> documentary series "Abroad Again in Britain", <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One's</a> "Britain's Hidden Heritage", and "Glorious Gardens from above", and <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV's</a> series "Inside the National Trust". The 2017 film "<a href="The%20Current%20War">The Current War</a>" was partly filmed at the estate. Cragside featured as the basis for the representation of Lockwood Manor in the 2018 movie .

Lynn Hill

Carolynn Marie "Lynn" Hill (born January 3, 1961) is a U.S. <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climber</a>. Widely regarded as one of the leading <a href="Climbing%20competition">competitive</a> <a href="sport%20climbing">sport climber</a>s in the world during the late 1980s and early 1990s, she is famous for making the <a href="first%20free%20ascent">first free ascent</a> of the difficult sheer rock face of "<a href="The%20Nose%20%28El%20Capitan%29">The Nose</a>" on <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a> in <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>, and for repeating it the next year in less than 24 hours. She has been described as both one of the best female climbers in the world and one of the best climbers of all time. One of the first successful women in the sport, Hill shaped rock climbing for women and became a public spokesperson, helping it gain wider popularity and arguing for sex equality. Hill has publicized climbing by appearing on television shows and documentaries and writing an autobiography, "".

Hill was a <a href="gymnastics">gymnast</a> early in life, nearly broke a world record <a href="powerlifting">lifting weights</a>, and ran competitively. She took to climbing at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and became a part of the climbing community in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> and <a href="Camp%204%20%28Yosemite%29">Camp 4</a> in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco <a href="Rock%20Master">Rock Master</a>. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: <a href="traditional%20climbing">traditional climbing</a>. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing "The Nose" of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the <a href="Patagonia%20%28clothing%29">Patagonia</a> gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.

Born in <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, Hill grew up in <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. She is the fifth of seven children; her mother was a dental hygienist and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a> but disliked the way girls "had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor". Thus, even though she was part of a successful <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim">California Angels</a>, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling "resistant to rules", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: "My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls—the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During <a href="High%20school%23United%20States">high school</a>, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.

In 1975, her sister and her sister's fiancé, Chuck Bludworth, took Hill on her first climbing trip; she was hooked, <a href="Lead%20climbing">leading</a> from the first day. For Hill, this activity became an escape from the emotional turmoil of her parents' divorce, and "by her late teens she identified less with her imperfect family in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a> than with an 'imperfect family of friends' at climbing areas". Hill took her first trip to <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite</a>, a central destination for climbers, at the age of 16, where she was introduced to the climbers at <a href="Camp%204%20%28Yosemite%29">Camp 4</a>. There she met Charlie Row, her first boyfriend. Their romance flourished; with him she climbed her first <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.11</a> and first <a href="Big%20wall%20climbing">big wall</a>.

As a young teenager, Hill climbed in southern California, primarily in <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20National%20Park">Joshua Tree National Park</a>. She earned money for day trips out to the park by working at a <a href="Carl%27s%20Jr.">Carl's Jr.</a> Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by <a href="Yvon%20Chouinard">Yvon Chouinard</a>'s ethic of "<a href="Clean%20climbing">leaving no trace</a>" on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of <a href="Beverly%20Johnson%20%28climber%29">Beverly Johnson</a> captured her imagination, particularly Johnson's 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a>. As Hill explains in her autobiography, "I was awed, but not just by the know-how and hard work she'd put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge—to climb one of the world's greatest big walls in one of the most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she'd given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves and not feel limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport."

Hill attended <a href="Fullerton%20College">Fullerton College</a> in the late 1970s, but she did not have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976–78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the <a href="Mountain%20rescue%20in%20the%20United%20States">search and rescue team</a>. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as "a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies". As Hill describes it, climbing in the late 1970s and early 1980s was "something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists". As she had earlier, Hill worked in order to be able to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers "these dirt-poor days ... [as] among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly."

Beverly Johnson had previously started to bridge the gender gap at Camp 4, but it remained strongly male-dominated. The community was particularly <a href="homosocial">homosocial</a>; its major historian calls it "edgy" rather than "oppressive" and argues that there was pressure on women to perform to men's standards and that "women had to contend with an army of men trying to maintain Camp 4 as a guy's domain". There was no coherent female climbing community; rather, female climbers tended to adopt the masculine attitudes of their compatriots. In her autobiography, Hill writes that climbing "back then was directed by a fraternity of men, and there was little encouragement of, or frankly, inclination for women to participate. Yet women climbers were out there." For example, from age 18 to 22, Hill climbed with <a href="Mari%20Gingery">Mari Gingery</a> every weekend, completing an ascent of "<a href="The%20Nose%20%28El%20Capitan%29">The Nose</a>" and then the first female-only ascent of "The Shield" on El Capitan over a period of six days.

Hill learned the essence of her climbing technique from the <a href="Stonemasters">Stonemasters</a> group during this time. She adopted the attitudes of <a href="traditional%20climbing">traditional climbing</a>, a style of climbing which emphasizes using removable protection rather than <a href="Bolt%20%28climbing%29">bolts</a> (which scar the rock) and rewards climbers who climb a new route from bottom to top without stopping or starting over. She also became a dedicated <a href="free%20climbing">free climber</a>, which emphasizes climbing an entire route without hanging on the rope or relying on equipment to skip difficult sections. Early on she was a fearless climber but after "a few death-defying experiences on routes with long run-outs" she learned to be wary of falling.

Hill climbed with and became involved with climber <a href="John%20Long%20%28climber%29">John Long</a> at the end of the 1970s. Their relationship began in the summer of 1978 when she heard him recite a poem he had written about a female climber and what kind of man she wanted.Hill and Long climbed together and worked out together, lifting weights and running. It was at his suggestion that she attempted to break the world record for the <a href="bench%20press">bench press</a> in her weight class (); however, while she could easily lift while training, in competition she froze. Hill and Long spent the winter of 1981 in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> climbing during the day and working nights at "dead end jobs" like pizza waitress.

The following year Hill and Long moved from Las Vegas to <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica, California</a> where she attended <a href="Santa%20Monica%20College">Santa Monica College</a> (SMC) and majored in biology. She was recruited by the track coach even though she had no competitive running experience. After training for a few months, she placed third in the <a href="1500%20meters">1500 meters</a> and fourth in the <a href="3000%20meters">3000 meters</a> at the state meet, helping SMC to win the state championship. To make ends meet, she worked at an outdoor store, as a gym teacher, and occasionally appeared on daredevil television shows.

In 1983, Hill was interviewed by "<a href="Ultrasport">Ultrasport</a>". They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview and as part of the trip she was taken to the <a href="Shawangunks">Shawangunks</a>, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to <a href="New%20Paltz%2C%20New%20York">New Paltz, New York</a>. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20New%20Paltz">State University of New York at New Paltz</a> and graduated with a degree in <a href="biology">biology</a> in 1985.

Hill started to participate in <a href="competition%20climbing">climbing competitions</a> in the mid-1980s, but one of her first significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to <a href="Free%20climbing">free climb</a> "Ophir Broke" in Ophir, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, which has a difficulty rating of <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.12d</a> and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest <a href="Crack%20climbing">crack climb</a> in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said "that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates the reason for this is that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: "The big lesson for me ... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping ... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all."

Living near the Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free climbing routes. In 1984 at <a href="Shawangunk%20Ridge">The Gunks</a> she performed an <a href="On-sight%20climbing">on-sight</a> first ascent of "Yellow Crack" (<a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.12c</a>) and "Vandals" (<a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.13a</a>); "Vandals" was the most difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of "Yellow Crack" was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time <a href="Russ%20Ruffa">Russ Ruffa</a> calling it "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen ... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." It was her climb of "Vandals" that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy ... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading "Tourist Treat" on-sight with only one fall, "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend <a href="Kevin%20Bein">Kevin Bein</a> called her, and "no man was climbing significantly better" than her.

As a result of Hill's impressive climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The <a href="French%20Alpine%20Club">French Alpine Club</a> invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the <a href="Verdon%20Gorge">Verdon Gorge</a>, <a href="Fontainebleau%20rock%20climbing">Fontainebleau</a>, and <a href="Buoux">Buoux</a>. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing "wildly acrobatic climbs" with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried <a href="sport%20climbing">sport climbing</a> in France for the first time that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in <a href="Sportroccia">Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia '86</a>, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the <a href="Rock%20Master">Rock Master</a> annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in <a href="Arco%2C%20Trentino">Arco</a> and one in <a href="Bardonecchia">Bardonecchia</a>, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to <a href="Catherine%20Destivelle">Catherine Destivelle</a> in a "disputed ruling" but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was "disorienting" because she did not understand the language, the "format" or the "judging" nor did the organizers of the competition. "There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response I got was, 'If the women climb without their tops, then we'll pay them the same.'" However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with "other strong women". In one interview, Hill said that "if there wasn't a Catherine Destivelle or <a href="Luisa%20Iovane">Luisa Iovane</a> ... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic." Destivelle became Hill's main competition in the late 1980s while <a href="Isabelle%20Patissier">Isabelle Patissier</a> emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s.

She became a professional climber in 1988 and the subsequent interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is "such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock ... You're in front of all these people ... You're there to "perform"." From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, she pointed out in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks just for the sake of a competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons.

Throughout the early 1980s, Hill had remained a <a href="Traditional%20climbing">traditionalist</a>, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted <a href="Hang%20dogs%23H">hang-dogging</a> (hanging on the rope at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of "Vandals", she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a "Great Debate" in 1986 at the <a href="American%20Alpine%20Club">American Alpine Club</a> at which a panel of all-star participants—including Hill—were invited to discuss the merits of the two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that "the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock ... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible ... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places—to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others".
From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's top sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco <a href="Rock%20Master">Rock Master</a>. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top ... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.

In January 1990, Hill set another landmark by becoming the first woman to <a href="Redpoint%20%28climbing%29">redpoint</a> a <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.14</a> (that is, she practiced free climbing the route before she was able to successfully climb it), "Masse Critique" in <a href="%C3%89venos">Cimaï</a>, France. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Tribout">J.B. Tribout</a>, who first ascended the route, challenged Hill, saying no woman would ever be able to climb it—Hill completed it in fewer tries than Tribout, after "nine days of exhausting effort". In 1992, it was described as the hardest rock climb ever made by a woman.

Hill has experienced only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in <a href="Buoux">Buoux</a>, France; after forgetting to tie a safety rope, she fell 85 ft (25 m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing for a few months to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.

Hill did not regard sport climbing to be real climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 and went back to traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, "the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession". In her autobiography, she also comments on the "bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) "<a href="The%20Nose%20%28El%20Capitan%29">The Nose</a>", a famous route on El Capitan in <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>.

Asked why she was motivated to climb "The Nose", Hill has said:
Hill first attempted to free climb "The Nose" in 1989 with <a href="Simon%20Nadin">Simon Nadin</a>, a climber she had met at the World Cup that year. Although he had never climbed <a href="Big%20wall%20climbing">big walls</a>, she felt at ease around him and both had a background in traditional climbing; they both shared a desire to free climb "The Nose" and agreed within hours of meeting to try the feat together. Their attempt to free climb "The Nose" failed. Four years later, in 1993, together with her partner <a href="Brooke%20Sandahl">Brooke Sandahl</a>, she became the first person, male or female, to free climb the route. Hill's original climbing grade for the "Free Nose" was <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.13b</a>. One of the most difficult <a href="Pitch%20%28ascent/descent%29">pitches</a>—"Changing Corners"—she rated at a <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.13b/c</a>, but she wrote in her autobiography that "rating the difficulty of such a pitch is almost impossible" and "the most accurate grade would be to call it 'once, or maybe twice, in a lifetime'". The rock face is nearly blank and there are next to no holds; to ascend the section, Hill had to use a "carefully coordinated sequence of opposite pressures between [her] feet, hands, elbows, and hips against the shallow walls of the corner" as well as turn her body completely around.

The next year, in 1994 she surpassed this achievement, by becoming the first person to free climb the entire route in a single 24-hour period. Usually the climb takes four to six days (Hill had previously done it in four) and most climbers are <a href="aid%20climbing">aid climbing</a>; that is, most climbers allow themselves to use mechanical aids to assist their climbing rather than just their own skill and bodies.

Hill wanted to join her effort with that of making a film that "would convey the history and spirit of climbing". Hill started endurance training in the spring for her summer ascent of "The Nose", aiming to be able to <a href="Glossary%20of%20climbing%20terms%23O">on-sight</a> a <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.13b</a> after climbing all day. She trained in <a href="Provence">Provence</a> and tested herself against "Mingus" in the <a href="Verdon%20Gorge">Verdon Gorge</a>, making the first on-sight free ascent of the route without a fall while simultaneously being the first woman to <a href="Glossary%20of%20climbing%20terms%23O">on-sight</a> a <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.13b</a>.

In her autobiography, Hill explains how she had "underestimated" how complicated climbing "The Nose" in a day would be with a film crew. Endless complications arose, such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute, the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid, and minor technical problems such as dead batteries. Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project. Her first attempt to free climb "The Nose" in a day was plagued with problems. She ran out of chalk after 22 pitches, very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat. She tried again soon after. On September 19 at 10pm, she and her partner Steve Sutton, began the ascent again, this time without a film crew. After 23 hours, she had free climbed the entire route. In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers, Joseph Taylor explains that Hill's ascent of "The Nose" demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">1960s counterculture</a> to become a "consumable experience". Hill staged what he describes as a "spectacle", filming the event "to capture the spontaneity of her one-day ascent", but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew.

The "Free Nose" and the "Free Nose in a day" remained unrepeated over 10 years after Hill's first ascents—despite numerous attempts by some of the best big wall climbers in the world. Over time, a consensus grade of <a href="Yosemite%20Decimal%20System">5.14a/b</a> has emerged for the most difficult pitch, known as pitch 27 or "Changing Corners", a fact which cements her Free Nose ascents as two of the most impressive achievements in climbing history. At the time, climbing legend <a href="Yvon%20Chouinard">Yvon Chouinard</a> called it "the biggest thing that has ever been done on rock" and <a href="Alexander%20Huber">Alexander Huber</a> later wrote that this climb "passed men's dominance in climbing and left them behind". He also regarded her statement upon completing the climb of "It goes, boys!" as reasonable although other climbers regarded it as provocative.
"The Nose" saw a second free ascent in 1998, when <a href="Scott%20Burke">Scott Burke</a> summitted after 261 days of effort. Then, on October 14, 2005, the team of <a href="Tommy%20Caldwell">Tommy Caldwell</a> and <a href="Beth%20Rodden">Beth Rodden</a> also free climbed "The Nose", and on October 16, 2005, Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours.

In 1995, Hill joined <a href="The%20North%20Face">The North Face</a> climbing team and was paid to travel around the world to climb. She first visited <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>'s <a href="Karavshin%20Valley">Karavshin Valley</a> to climb with <a href="Alex%20Lowe">Alex Lowe</a>, <a href="Kitty%20Calhoun">Kitty Calhoun</a>, <a href="Jay%20Smith%20%28climber%29">Jay Smith</a>, <a href="Conrad%20Anker">Conrad Anker</a>, <a href="Greg%20Child">Greg Child</a>, <a href="Dan%20Osman">Dan Osman</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Noble">Chris Noble</a>. They camped for a month and were cut off from the world, without even a radio. In her autobiography, Hill writes that "such isolation made me feel vulnerable". Hill was not used to <a href="mountain%20climbing">mountain climbing</a> (as opposed to <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a>) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her, with its increased risk of storms and rock slides. Furthermore, she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing. Rather than pursue ever higher climbs, therefore, she chose to climb in new places, such as Morocco, Vietnam, Thailand, Scotland, Japan, Madagascar, Australia, and South America; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general.

Hill started offering climbing camps in five locations in the United States in 2005, with plans for more. For <a href="US%24">US$</a>2,000, participants received five days of an "immersive adventure camp", including one-on-one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers. As of 2012 Hill was living in <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a> and still travelling widely. From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various <a href="climbing%20gear">climbing gear</a> companies. As of 2013, Hill was a sponsored athlete for the <a href="Patagonia%20%28clothing%29">Patagonia</a> gear and clothing company. While Hill used to easily obtain sponsorships, in 2010 she said in an interview that she was "too old" to obtain shoe sponsorships.

Hill repeatedly tells a story from when she was 14 years old and <a href="bouldering">bouldering</a> in <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20National%20Park">Joshua Tree</a>: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I not to be able to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex."

Long an advocate for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued that men and women can climb the same routes: "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on <a href="body%20composition">body composition</a>, size, and <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, explaining that climbing "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios[s]", less <a href="Body%20fat%20percentage">body fat</a>, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that "theoretically somebody as short as me could be the best in the world because it doesn't depend so much on height now ... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing."

Hill experienced discrimination throughout her climbing career and in an interview with <a href="John%20Stieger">John Stieger</a> in "<a href="Climbing%20%28magazine%29">Climbing</a>", she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to <a href="sexist">sexist</a> remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the "<a href="tomboy">tomboy</a>" she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.

Hill has been credited with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it and in part because <a href="Title%20IX">Title IX</a> funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt "responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion". Climber <a href="John%20Long%20%28climber%29">John Long</a> explains that Hill "was a prodigy and everyone knew as much ... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20National%20Park">Josh</a>, it was said Lynn shone owing to <a href="quartz%20monzonite">quartz monzonite</a>'s superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In <a href="Yosemite">Yosemite</a>, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose."

Hill has participated in various television productions, such as "<a href="Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28TV%29">Survival of the Fittest</a>", which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero <a href="Beverly%20Johnson%20%28climber%29">Beverly Johnson</a> who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for the men in the competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that <a href="NBC">NBC</a> canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on "<a href="The%20Guinness%20Game">The Guinness Game</a>", "<a href="That%27s%20Incredible%21">That's Incredible!</a>", and "<a href="Ripley%27s%20Believe%20it%20or%20Not">Ripley's Believe it or Not</a>". She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for "That's Incredible!" as "perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> that showed a photograph of her climbing.

In 1999, Hill appeared in "<a href="Extreme%20%28film%29">Extreme</a>", an <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> film on adventure sports. For that production, she and <a href="Nancy%20Feagin">Nancy Feagin</a> had been filmed the previous May crack climbing in <a href="Indian%20Creek%20%28climbing%20area%29">Indian Creek Valley</a> in Utah. She also appeared in "Vertical Frontier", a documentary about competitive climbing in California's Yosemite Valley.

In 2002, Hill collaboratively wrote an autobiography, "", with mountaineer and writer <a href="Greg%20Child">Greg Child</a>, published by <a href="W.W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W.W. Norton & Company</a>. As she describes the process, "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point ["sic"], because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer <a href="Rachel%20de%20Silva">Rachel de Silva</a> explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.

Hill met fellow Gunks climber <a href="Russ%20Raffa">Russ Raffa</a> on her first trip to New York and by 1984 he had become "her constant companion". On October 22, 1988, the two married; however, their relationship ended in March 1991 in part because Hill wanted children and because the couple rarely saw each other. At the same time, Hill moved to <a href="Grambois">Grambois</a>, France, to pursue her climbing career; she settled there because of the world-class climbing areas in the <a href="Lub%C3%A9ron">Lubéron</a> region and the many friends she had there. While living and climbing in Europe, Hill became fluent in both French and Italian.

Hill met her partner as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a climbing trip in <a href="Moab%2C%20Utah">Moab, Utah</a>, and at the age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, "I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made."

Ulysses (poem)

"Ulysses" is a poem in <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> by the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> poet <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> (1809–1892), written in 1833 and published in 1842 in his well-received <a href="Poems%20%28Tennyson%2C%201842%29">second volume of poetry</a>. An oft-quoted poem, it is popularly used to illustrate the <a href="dramatic%20monologue">dramatic monologue</a> form. Facing old age, mythical hero <a href="Odysseus">Ulysses</a> describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom, <a href="Ithaca">Ithaca</a>, after his far-ranging travels. Despite his reunion with his wife <a href="Penelope">Penelope</a> and son <a href="Telemachus">Telemachus</a>, Ulysses yearns to explore again.

The character of Ulysses (in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante's</a> Ulisse in his "<a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy%23Inferno">Inferno</a>" (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.

For much of this poem's history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, admiring him for his determination "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield". The view that Tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in his life—the death of his closest friend—that prompted him to write it. In the twentieth century, some new interpretations of "Ulysses" highlighted potential <a href="irony">ironies</a> in the poem. They argued, for example, that Ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family, and they questioned more positive assessments of Ulysses' character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature.
"Ulysses" and "The Lotos Eaters" are companion pieces but in tone and thought they are opposites, whereas "The Lotos Eaters" teaches us the lesson of rest and inaction, the second poem "Ulysses" inspires and excites us to be active and energetic in our life.

As the poem begins, Ulysses has returned to his kingdom, Ithaca, having made a long journey home after fighting in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the "savage race" (line 4) whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death—"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains" (24–26)—and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus will be a good king—"Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties" (39)—he seems to have lost any connection to his son—"He works his work, I mine" (43)—and the conventional methods of governing—"by slow prudence" and "through soft degrees" (36, 37). In the final section, Ulysses turns to his fellow mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past:

<poem>
</poem>

The speaker's language is unelaborated but forceful, and it expresses Ulysses' conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. There is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of Ulysses' words and the sounds that express them. For example, the poem's insistent <a href="iambic%20pentameter">iambic pentameter</a> is often interrupted by <a href="spondee">spondee</a>s (<a href="metrical%20feet">metrical feet</a> that consist of two long syllables); such laboured language slows the poem (and in other places may cast doubt upon the <a href="unreliable%20narrator">reliability</a> of Ulysses' utterances):

<poem>
</poem>

Observing their burdensome <a href="prosodic">prosodic</a> effect, the poet <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> remarked, "these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the "Iliad"."
Many of the poem's clauses carry over into the following line; these <a href="enjambment">enjambment</a>s emphasize Ulysses' restlessness and dissatisfaction.

The poem's seventy lines of <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a> are presented as a <a href="dramatic%20monologue">dramatic monologue</a>. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses' speech functions in this format; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a> to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a "revised version [of lines 1–5] for public consumption": a "savage race" is revised to a "rugged people".

The ironic interpretations of "Ulysses" may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily "<a href="unreliable%20narrator">unreliable</a>". According to critic Dwight Culler, the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator's accidental revelations. (Compare the more obvious use of this approach in Robert Browning's "<a href="My%20Last%20Duchess">My Last Duchess</a>".) Culler himself views "Ulysses" as a <a href="dialectic">dialectic</a> in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life; Ulysses moves through four emotional stages that are self-revelatory, not ironic: beginning with his rejection of the barren life to which he has returned in Ithaca, he then fondly recalls his heroic past, recognizes the validity of Telemachus' method of governing, and with these thoughts plans another journey.

Tennyson completed the poem on 20 October 1833, but it was not published until 1842, in his second collection of "<a href="Poems%20%28Tennyson%2C%201842%29">Poems</a>". Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, "Ulysses" was not revised after its publication.

Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior <a href="monologue">monologue</a>s, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.

Tennyson penned "Ulysses" after the death of his close <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> friend, the poet <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Hallam">Arthur Henry Hallam</a> (1811–1833), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy, writing verse, and travelling in <a href="southern%20France">southern France</a>, the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, and Germany. Tennyson considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman.

When Tennyson heard on 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, he was living in <a href="Somersby%2C%20Lincolnshire">Somersby</a>, Lincolnshire, in cramped quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, <a href="Emilia%20Tennyson">Emily</a>, who had been engaged to Hallam.

According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, "There is more about myself in "Ulysses", which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in "In Memoriam"." Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, "<a href="In%20Memoriam%20A.H.H.">In Memoriam A.H.H.</a>", begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.

Other critics find stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author that make "Ulysses" exceptional. W. W. Robson writes, "Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and 'committed' individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets." He finds that Tennyson's two widely noted personae, the "responsible social being" and the melancholic poet, meet uniquely in "Ulysses", yet seem not to recognize each other within the text.

Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources; his treatment of Ulysses is the first modern account. The <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> poet <a href="Homer">Homer</a> introduced Ulysses (<a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> in Greek), and many later poets took up the character, including <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, <a href="Dante">Dante</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>. Homer's "Odyssey" provides the poem's narrative background: in its eleventh book the prophet <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a> foretells that Ulysses will return to Ithaca after a difficult voyage, then begin a new, mysterious voyage, and later die a peaceful, "unwarlike" death that comes vaguely "from the sea". At the conclusion of Tennyson's poem, his Ulysses is contemplating undertaking this new voyage.

Tennyson's character, however, is not the lover of public affairs seen in Homer's poems. Rather, "Ulisse" from <a href="Dante">Dante</a>'s "<a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy%23Inferno">Inferno</a>" is Tennyson's main source for the character, which has an important effect on the poem's interpretation. Ulisse recalls his voyage in the "Inferno"'s 26th <a href="canto">canto</a>, in which he is condemned to the Eighth Circle of false counsellors for misusing his gift of reason. Dante treats Ulisse, with his "zeal …/ T'explore the world", as an evil counsellor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca. Tennyson projects this zeal into Ulysses' unquenched desire for knowledge:

<poem>
</poem>

The poet's intention to recall the Homeric character remains evident in certain passages. "I am become a name" (11) recalls an episode in the "Odyssey" in which <a href="Demodocus%20%28Homer%29">Demodocus</a> sings about Odysseus' adventures in the king's presence, acknowledging his fame. With phrases such as "There gloom the dark broad seas" (45) and "The deep / Moans round with many voices" (55–56), Tennyson seems to be consciously invoking Homer.

Critics have also noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race "That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me" (5) echoes <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet's</a> <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a>: "What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more." Tennyson's "How dull it is to pause, to make an end, / To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!" (22–23) recalls Shakespeare's Ulysses in "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</a>" (c. 1602):
<poem>
</poem>

The last movement of "Ulysses", which is among the most familiar passages in nineteenth-century English-language poetry, presents decisive evidence of the influence of Dante. Ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports, seas, and his mariners. The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson finally leaves Ulysses "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield" (70), recalling the Dantesque damnable desire for knowledge beyond all bounds. The words of Dante's character as he exhorts his men to the journey find parallel in those of Tennyson's Ulysses, who calls his men to join him on one last voyage. Quoting Dante's Ulisse:

<poem>
</poem>

However, critics note that in the Homeric narrative, Ulysses' original mariners are dead. A significant irony therefore develops from Ulysses' speech to his sailors—"Come, my friends, / 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world" (56–57). Since Dante's Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the "Inferno", Ulysses' entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell.

The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has provided one of the great debates among scholars of the poem. Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses' speech "affirmatively", or without <a href="irony">irony</a>. Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses, and further criticism has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses' character are the fault of the poet himself.

Key to the affirmative reading of "Ulysses" is the biographical context of the poem. Such a reading takes into account Tennyson's statements about writing the poem—"the need of going forward"—and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses' determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam's death. Ulysses is thus seen as an heroic character whose determination to seek "some work of noble note" (52) is courageous in the face of a "still hearth" (2) and old age. The passion and conviction of Tennyson's language—and even his own comments on the poem—signify that the poet, as was typical in the Victorian age, admired courage and persistence. Read straightforwardly, "Ulysses" promotes the questing spirit of youth, even in old age, and a refusal to resign and face life passively.

Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to "Ulysses" sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson's stature rose. After Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses' inconsistencies and Tennyson's conception of the poem in 1948, the ironic interpretation became dominant. Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of <a href="Byronic%20hero">Lord Byron's flawed heroes</a>, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses' resolute final utterance—"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield"—is undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics compare this line to <a href="Satan">Satan</a>'s "courage never to submit or yield" in <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>" (1667).

Ulysses' apparent disdain for those around him is another facet of the ironic perspective. He declares that he is "matched with an aged wife" (3), indicates his weariness in governing a "savage race" (4), and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A skeptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his "slow prudence" (36). However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—"blameless", "discerning", and "decent"—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson's poetry and within the classical tradition, where "blameless" is an attribute of gods and heroes.

Critic E. J. Chiasson argued in 1954 that Ulysses is without faith in an afterlife, and that Tennyson uses a "method of indirection" to affirm the need for religious faith by showing how Ulysses' lack of faith leads to his neglect of kingdom and family. Chiasson regards the poem as "intractable" in Tennyson's canon, but finds that the poem's meaning resolves itself when this indirection is understood: it illustrates Tennyson's conviction that "disregarding religious sanctions and 'submitting all things to desire' leads to either a <a href="wikt%3Asybaritic">sybaritic</a> or a brutal repudiation of responsibility and 'life'."

Other ironic readings have found Ulysses longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest. In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson's tendency toward the melancholic. <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> opines that "Tennyson could not tell a story at all". He finds Dante's treatment of Ulysses exciting, while Tennyson's piece is "an elegiac mood". "Ulysses" is found lacking in narrative action; the hero's goal is vague, and by the poem's famous last line, it is not clear for what he is "striving", or to what he refuses to yield. According to Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker, Tennyson's characters "move" through time and space to be moved inwardly. 
To Ulysses, experience is "somewhere out there",

Contemporary reviews of "Ulysses" were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author <a href="John%20Sterling%20%28author%29">John Sterling</a>—like Tennyson a member of the <a href="Cambridge%20Apostles">Cambridge Apostles</a>—wrote in the "<a href="Quarterly%20Review">Quarterly Review</a>" in 1842, "How superior is 'Ulysses'! There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble." Tennyson's 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a>. Quoting three lines of "Ulysses" in an 1842 letter to Tennyson—

—Carlyle remarked, "These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill whole Lachrymatories as I read."

English theologian <a href="Richard%20Holt%20Hutton">Richard Holt Hutton</a> summarized the poem as Tennyson's "friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will." The contemporary poet <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech "the least "plain", the most "un-Homeric", which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." A bit later, journalist and apologist <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">Gilbert Keith Chesterton</a> saw Ulysses as a "tribute to Christianity" as getting to the heart of the remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home."

Despite the critical acclaim "Ulysses" received, its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included—and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson's oeuvre is the result of two trends, according to Tennyson scholar <a href="Matthew%20Rowlinson">Matthew Rowlinson</a>: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported. He argues that "Ulysses" forms part of the prehistory of <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a "colonial administrator", and his reference to seeking a newer world (57) echoes the phrase "<a href="New%20World">New World</a>", which became common during the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. While "Ulysses" cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson's later work as <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a> sometimes argues for the value of Britain's colonies, or was accused of jingoism. Rowlinson invokes the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> theorist <a href="Louis%20Althusser">Louis Althusser</a>'s extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical, finding that Tennyson's poem "comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic".

In a 1929 essay, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> called "Ulysses" a "perfect poem". An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot's "<a href="Gerontion">Gerontion</a>" (1920). Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life's end. An excerpt from "Gerontion" reads as an ironic comment on the introductory lines of "Ulysses":

The Italian poet <a href="Giovanni%20Pascoli">Giovanni Pascoli</a> (1855–1912) stated that his long lyric poem "L'ultimo viaggio" was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a>'s prophecy that Ulysses would die "a mild death off the sea". Pascoli's Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.

"Ulysses" remains much admired, even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem. Professor of literature <a href="Basil%20Willey">Basil Willey</a> commented in 1956, "In 'Ulysses' the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [Tennyson] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling."
In the fifteenth edition of "<a href="Bartlett%27s%20Familiar%20Quotations">Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</a>" (1980), nine sections of "Ulysses", comprising 36 of the poem's 70 lines, are quoted, compared to only six in the ninth edition (1891).

Come, my friends, | 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.' (ll. 55-57)

Eurasian blackcap

The Eurasian blackcap ("Sylvia atricapilla") usually known simply as the blackcap, is a common and widespread <a href="typical%20warbler">typical warbler</a>. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. The blackcap's closest relative is the <a href="garden%20warbler">garden warbler</a>, which looks quite different but has a similar song.

The blackcap breeds in much of Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred habitat is mature <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers as well as other blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in <a href="bramble">bramble</a>s or scrub, and the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11 days. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in 11–12 days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, for the rest of the year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s in winter.

Despite extensive hunting in Mediterranean countries and the natural hazards of predation and disease, the blackcap has been extending its range for several decades, and is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>. Its rich and varied song has led to it being described as the "mock nightingale" and it has featured in literature, films and music. In <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Messiaen's</a> opera "<a href="Saint%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20d%27Assise">Saint François d'Assise</a>", the <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">saint</a> is represented by themes based on the blackcap's song.

The genus "Sylvia", the <a href="typical%20warbler">typical warbler</a>s, forms part of a large family of Old World warblers, the <a href="Sylviidae">Sylviidae</a>. The blackcap and its nearest relative, the <a href="garden%20warbler">garden warbler</a>, are an ancient <a href="superspecies">species pair</a> which diverged very early from the rest of the genus at between 12 and 16 million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus "Sylvia" and the garden warbler in "Epilais". These <a href="sister%20group">sister species</a> have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other "Sylvia" species except the <a href="lesser%20whitethroat">lesser whitethroat</a> and <a href="common%20whitethroat">common whitethroat</a>. The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the <a href="African%20hill%20babbler">African hill babbler</a> and <a href="Dohrn%27s%20thrush-babbler">Dohrn's thrush-babbler</a>, both of which should probably be placed in "Sylvia" rather than their current genera, "Pseudoalcippe" and "Horizorhinus" respectively.

The blackcap was one of the many <a href="Aves%20in%20the%2010th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">bird species originally described</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in the landmark 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", as "Motacilla atricapilla". The current genus name is from <a href="New%20Latin">Modern Latin</a> "silvia", a woodland sprite, related to "silva", a wood. The species name, like the English name, refers to the male's black cap. "Atricapilla" is from the Latin "ater", "black", and "capillus", "hair (of the head)".

<a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>s and <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>s of the blackcap have been found in a number of European countries; the oldest, dated to 1.2–1.0 million years ago, are from the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> of Bulgaria. Fossils from France show that the genus "Sylvia" dates back at least 20 million years.

The differences between subspecies are small, making subspecific boundaries hard to define, and the exact distribution of "S. a. heineken" is unclear, since birds from northwest Africa may be of this form. About 2% of male blackcaps on <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> are <a href="melanism">melanistic</a>, with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast. Melanistic females are rarer, and are characterised by grey-brown underparts. This dark <a href="morph%20%28zoology%29">morph</a> has also been recorded from the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, but not from <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. The melanistic birds were formerly sometimes considered to be a distinct subspecies, "S. a. obscura".

The blackcap is a mainly grey warbler with distinct male and female <a href="plumage">plumage</a>s. The <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate subspecies</a> is about long with a wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to the outer edge of each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is reddish brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed "Sylvia" species, such <a href="Sardinian%20warbler">Sardinian</a> and <a href="Orphean%20warbler">Orphean warbler</a>s have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap. They are also larger and have white edges on the tail.

Blackcaps have a complete <a href="Moulting">moult</a> in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding in the north of the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and <a href="crossbreed">cross-breeding</a> of captive birds shows that the timing is <a href="gene">gene</a>tically controlled.

The male's song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30 seconds. The song is repeated for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s and valleys in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the "Leiern" (drawling) song by the German <a href="ornithology">ornithologists</a> who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a <a href="great%20tit">great tit</a>'s call but more fluting. The main song is confusable with that of the garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the <a href="common%20nightingale">common nightingale</a>. The main call is a hard "tac-tac", like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking "sweet" alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.

Male blackcaps will sometimes sing even when incubating, especially with the second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.

The continental breeding range of the blackcap lies between the 14–30° July <a href="Isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherms</a>, and is occupied by the nominate subspecies, the other forms being restricted to islands or fringe areas in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and eastern Iberia. Birds on the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and in the milder west and south of the main Eurasian distribution often winter within the nesting range, but populations elsewhere are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>. The blackcap is a leap-frog migrant; birds from the north of the breeding range travel furthest south, whereas Mediterranean breeders move much shorter distances. The wintering areas overlap with the breeding range, but also include extensive areas in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> south to <a href="Lake%20Malawi">Lake Malawi</a>, and further north in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The large majority of birds wintering in eastern Africa are of the southwest Asian race, "S. a. dammholzi".

There is a migratory divide in Europe at <a href="longitude">longitude</a> 10–11°E. Birds to the west of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, on opposite sides of the migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.

In recent decades, substantial numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from <a href="bird%20feeder">bird table</a>s), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the <a href="Sahara">Sahara Desert</a>. These wintering birds come from Germany, and <a href="isotope%20analysis">isotope analysis</a> (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>.

The blackcap's main breeding habitat is mature deciduous woodland, with good scrub cover below the trees. Other habitats, such as parks, large gardens and overgrown hedges, are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for songposts and an established <a href="understory">understory</a>. Where other "Sylvia" warblers also breed, blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives, preferably those with a good canopy, such as <a href="Quercus%20robur">pedunculate oak</a>. In prime habitat, breeding densities reach 100–200 pairs per square kilometre (250–500 pairs per square mile) in northern Europe, and 500–900 pairs per square kilometre (1,250–2,250 pairs per square mile) in Italy. Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests. Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to .

The preferred winter habitat around the Mediterranean is scrub and olive orchards, where densities approach the levels found in the best breeding areas. The British wintering population is atypical, with 95% found in gardens, mostly in towns at altitudes below . In Africa, habitats include cultivated land, <a href="acacia">acacia</a> scrub, <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s and forest, and these warblers are found at altitudes up to in the east of the continent. Wintering birds wander in search of good fruit supplies, but often stay in good feeding areas, and return in subsequent winters. Migrants may occur in a wide variety of habitats, such as <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a> and <a href="fen">fen</a>, but show a preference for shrubland.

When male blackcaps return to their breeding areas, they establish a <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>. Adults that have previously bred return to the site they have used in previous summers, whereas inexperienced birds either wander until they find a suitable area, or establish a very large initial territory which contracts under pressure from neighbours. Territorial boundaries are established initially by loud singing, performed while the male displays with his crown raised, tail fanned and slow wingbeats. This display is followed, if necessary, by a chase, often leading to a fight. The typical territory size in a French study was , but in insect-rich tall <a href="maquis%20shrubland">maquis</a> in Gibraltar, the average was only . Females feed within a home range which may overlap other blackcap territories, and covers up to six times the area of the defended zone.

"Sylvia" warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as <a href="Conspecificity">conspecifics</a>. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are a feature of the "Sylvia" warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes <a href="interspecific%20competition">interspecific competition</a> and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.

Blackcaps first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, although both sexes may sometimes deviate from this. A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display involving raising the black crown feathers, fluffing the tail, slow wingbeats, and a short flapping flight. He also builds one or more simple nests (cock nests), usually near his songpost. The final nest, which may be one of the cock nests or built from scratch, is a neat cup of roots, stems and grasses lined with fine material such as hair. The nest is typically deep and across, and is built in the cover of <a href="bramble">bramble</a>, scrubs or trees. It is constructed mainly by the female, and may be up to above the ground, although lower than is more typical. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is typically 4–6 eggs (range 2–7), which are usually buff with grey and brown blotches and a few dark brown spots. The average size of the egg is .

The eggs are <a href="incubate%20%28bird%29">incubated</a> for an average of 11 days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 11–12 days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mob</a> a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.

Of eggs laid, 65–93% hatch successfully, and 75–92% of the chicks go on to fledge. The productivity (young fledged per nest) varies with location, level of predation and quality of habitat, but the national figure for the UK was 2.5. The adult annual survival rate is 43% (males 46%, females 29%), and 36% of juveniles live through their first year. The typical life expectancy is two years, but the record is 13 years and 10 months for a bird in the Czech Republic.

The blackcap feeds mainly on insects during the breeding season, then switches to fruit in late summer, the change being triggered by an internal <a href="chronobiology">biological rhythm</a>. When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries, <a href="pollen">pollen</a> and <a href="nectar">nectar</a> if there are insufficient insects available, then soon switch to their preferred diet. They mainly pick prey off <a href="leaf">foliage</a> and twigs, but may occasionally hover, flycatch or feed on the ground. Blackcaps eat a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey, although <a href="aphids">aphids</a> are particularly important early in the season, and <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s are also taken in large numbers. Small snails are swallowed whole, since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird's eggs. Chicks are mainly fed soft-bodied insects, fruit only being provided if invertebrates are scarce.

In July, the diet switches increasingly to fruit. The <a href="protein">protein</a> needed for egg-laying and for the chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat a wide range of small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a>. The <a href="mistle%20thrush">mistle thrush</a>, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; <a href="Sambucus%20nigra">elder</a> makes up a large proportion of the diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich <a href="olive">olive</a>s and <a href="Pistacia%20lentiscus">lentisc</a> are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.

The German birds wintering in British gardens rely on provided food, and the major items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only <a href="Christmas%20cake">Christmas cake</a>. Fruit is also eaten, notably <a href="cotoneaster">cotoneaster</a> (41% of the fruit consumed), <a href="ivy">ivy</a> and <a href="honeysuckle">honeysuckle</a>, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as <a href="common%20starling">starlings</a> and <a href="common%20blackbird">blackbirds</a>. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.

Blackcaps are caught by <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s in the breeding range, and by <a href="Eleonora%27s%20falcon">Eleonora's falcon</a>s on migration. <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>s and <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a>s take eggs and young, as do mammals such as <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, <a href="least%20weasel">weasels</a> and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s. Domestic cats are the most important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.

The only blood parasites found in a study of blackcaps trapped on migration were <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>ns from the genera "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" and "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>". Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of "<a href="Haemoproteus%20parabelopolskyi">H. parabelopolskyi</a>" are found only in the blackcap, and form a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan "<a href="Isospora%20ashmoonensis">Isospora ashmoonensis</a>" was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry <a href="parasitic%20worm">parasitic worm</a>s that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include <a href="Mallophaga">chewing lice</a> and <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, in his "<a href="History%20of%20Animals">History of Animals</a>", considered that the <a href="garden%20warbler">garden warbler</a> eventually <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosed</a> into a blackcap. The blackcap's song has led to it being described as the "mock nightingale" or "country nightingale", and <a href="John%20Clare">John Clare</a>, in "The March Nightingale" describes the listener as believing that the rarer species has arrived prematurely. "He stops his own and thinks the nightingale/Hath of her monthly reckoning counted wrong". The song is also the topic of Italian poet <a href="Giovanni%20Pascoli">Giovanni Pascoli</a>'s "La Capinera" [The Blackcap].

<a href="Giovanni%20Verga">Giovanni Verga</a>'s 1871 novel "Storia di una capinera", according to its author, was inspired by a story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by <a href="cholera">cholera</a> falls in love with a family friend, only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by <a href="Franco%20Zeffirelli">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, and its English-language version was retitled as "<a href="Sparrow%20%281993%20film%29">Sparrow</a>". In "<a href="Saint%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20d%27Assise">Saint François d'Assise</a>", an opera by <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Messiaen</a>, the orchestration is based on bird song. <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">St Francis</a> himself is represented by the blackcap.

Folk names for the blackcap often refer to its most obvious plumage feature (black-headed peggy, King Harry black cap and coal hoodie) or to its song, as in the "nightingale" names above. Other old names are based on its choice of nesting material (Jack Straw, hay bird, hay chat and hay Jack). There is a tradition of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> bases being named for birds. A former base near <a href="Stretton%2C%20Warrington">Stretton</a> in Cheshire was called <a href="RNAS%20Stretton%20%28HMS%20Blackcap%29">HMS "Blackcap"</a>.

The blackcap has a very large range, and its population in Europe is estimated at 25–49 million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia, the total population is between 80–196 million individuals. It is therefore classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>.

Blackcaps and other small birds are illegally trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a <a href="delicacy">delicacy</a>. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroes</a>, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, the spread of the blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining <a href="barred%20warbler">barred warbler</a>.

Garden warbler

The garden warbler ("Sylvia borin") is a common and widespread small <a href="bird">bird</a> that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed <a href="typical%20warbler">typical warbler</a> with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused with a number of other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song is similar to that of the <a href="Eurasian%20blackcap">blackcap</a>, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.

The preferred breeding habitat in Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of four or five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are <a href="incubate%20%28bird%29">incubated</a> for 11–12 days. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 10 days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, <a href="Common%20fig">figs</a> being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.

The garden warbler is hunted by <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s and <a href="domestic%20cat">domestic cat</a>s, and its eggs and nestlings are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. It may be host to various <a href="flea">flea</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s and internal <a href="parasitism">parasites</a>, and it is a host of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>. The large and fairly stable numbers and huge range of the garden warbler mean that it is classed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. Despite a small population decline in much of its European range, the bird's breeding distribution is expanding northwards in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.

The genus "Sylvia", the <a href="typical%20warbler">typical warbler</a>s, forms part of a large family of Old World warblers, the <a href="Sylviidae">Sylviidae</a>. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20 million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the <a href="Eurasian%20blackcap">blackcap</a>, are an ancient <a href="superspecies">species pair</a> which diverged very early from the rest of the genus, between 12 and 16 million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus "Sylvia" and the garden warbler in "Epilais". These <a href="sister%20group">sister species</a> have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other "Sylvia" species except the <a href="lesser%20whitethroat">lesser whitethroat</a> and <a href="common%20whitethroat">common whitethroat</a>.

The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the <a href="African%20hill%20babbler">African hill babbler</a> and <a href="Dohrn%27s%20thrush-babbler">Dohrn's thrush-babbler</a>, both of which should probably be placed in "Sylvia" rather than their current genera, "Pseudoalcippe" and "Horizorhinus" respectively.

The garden warbler was given the <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> "Motacilla borin" by the Dutch naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> in 1783. The current genus name is from <a href="New%20Latin">Modern Latin</a> "silvia", a woodland <a href="nymph">nymph</a>, related to "silva", a wood. The specific "borin" is derived from a local name for the bird in the <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> area of Italy; it derives from the Latin "bos", ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.

There are two recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>.


Intermediate birds occur where the recognised forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including "S. b. kreczmeri" in Poland and "S. b. pateffi" in Bulgaria, but these are not generally accepted as valid <a href="taxon">taxa</a>.

The garden warbler is long with a wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to for birds preparing to migrate. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts. It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower <a href="mandible">mandible</a>. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies "S. b. woodwardi" is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts. The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than confirms "S. b. woodwardi" when birds are trapped.

The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species. The <a href="melodious%20warbler">melodious</a> and <a href="icterine%20warbler">icterine warbler</a>s usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The <a href="booted%20warbler">booted warbler</a> is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. <a href="western%20olivaceous%20warbler">Western</a> and <a href="eastern%20olivaceous%20warbler">eastern olivaceous warbler</a>s are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile <a href="barred%20warbler">barred warbler</a>s, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.

Juvenile garden warblers have a partial <a href="moulting">moult</a> mainly involving the body plumage between June and September prior to <a href="bird%20migration">migration</a>. Adults also have a similar, but sometimes more extensive, partial moult in late summer, and a complete moult in their African wintering areas before the return migration.

The male's song, usually delivered by birds in dense cover, is a rich musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable with that of the blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp "kek-kek", which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping "tchurr-r-r-r" resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. The juvenile has a "quia" alarm vocalisation. The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both "Sylvia" warblers will also sing against <a href="common%20nightingale">common nightingale</a>s, which have a similar song despite being unrelated. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.

The garden warbler breeds in most of Europe between the <a href="isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherms</a> and east across temperate Asia to the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei River</a> in Siberia. Its range extends further north than any other "Sylvia" warbler. All populations are migratory, wintering in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> as far south as South Africa. Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest, reorientating to the south or southeast once in Africa, although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and across the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. "S. b. woodwardi" reaches Africa by a more easterly route, many birds passing through the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>. When garden warblers cross the Sahara, they fly at night, resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day. During their journey, they can metabolise not only <a href="body%20fat">body fat</a> but also up to 19% of their breast and leg muscles and 39% of their digestive tract. Many birds pause for a few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south.

The nominate subspecies occurs in the western and central parts of the winter range, although some birds occur as far east as Kenya. "S. b. woodwardi" winters in eastern and southern Africa. Movements in Africa are poorly known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years. There are only a handful of records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes are poorly known, but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean. This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">São Tomé and Príncipe</a>, Somalia, Yemen, <a href="Svalbard">Svalbard</a>, <a href="Jan%20Mayen">Jan Mayen</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>.

The breeding habitat of the garden warbler is open areas with dense bushes, including thickets and woodland edges. Shady areas and a bushy or <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> undergrowth are preferred, as are woods adjacent to rivers or <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s; in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> it favours thickets on the shores of small lakes. A tolerance of <a href="willow">willow</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a> and <a href="birch">birch</a> allows it to breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European "Sylvia" warbler. Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided, although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting. Despite its name, it is not a bird of gardens. In Africa, a wide range of habitats with trees are used, although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided. This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to in suitable mountain woodland, although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap, and in moister areas than the common whitethroat.

Garden warblers first breed when they are one year old, and are mainly <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, although the male at least may sometimes deviate from this. When males return to their breeding areas, they establish a <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>. "Sylvia" warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as <a href="Conspecificity">conspecifics</a>. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are a feature of the "Sylvia" warblers as a group, and it has been suggested that this promotes <a href="interspecific%20competition">interspecific competition</a> and helps to segregate territories between related species. However, it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression. There are typically 3–9 territories per hectare (1.2–3.6 per acre), but in prime habitat, such as moist willow or birch woodland or young <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> regrowth, there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare (4 per acre). Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at .

A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched. He will also build a number of simple nests (cock's nests) to show to his mate, although only rarely will she complete the structure, usually starting afresh. The nest is concealed in vegetation, the nature of which depends on local availability. "<a href="Rubus">Rubus</a>" species are commonly used in temperate regions, with willow predominating in alpine valleys. Sometimes, particularly in <a href="stinging%20nettle">stinging nettle</a>s, the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems, in the manner of a <a href="Eurasian%20reed%20warbler">reed warbler</a>. The nest is normally between above the ground, and very rarely higher than . The nest is a cup of dry grass, moss and twigs, with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair. It is larger and heavier than a blackcap's nest, averaging high and wide with a cup deep and wide.

The first eggs are laid in late April in southern Germany, early May in northwest Europe, and late May in Finland. The season is prolonged with some birds nesting as late as July. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is typically four or five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish or buff with grey, purple and brown blotches. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are <a href="incubate%20%28bird%29">incubated</a> for 11–12 days by both adults, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 10 days after hatching (range 9–12), leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks, and the family may stay together for a few days after that. The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure, the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible, even while still flightless. This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood, but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves. One brood per year is normal, although a few second broods are known.

The southward migration starts in mid-July, with larger numbers departing in August and peaking in early September. Most adults have gone by mid-September, although juveniles may linger for another month.

On average, just over 50% of breeding pairs are successful in producing at least one fledged young from a nest, with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success. In the UK, more than 50% of the failures are due to predation and about 30% result from food shortages in bad weather. The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles in their first year. The typical lifespan is two years, but a bird in Sweden lived to ten years and two months Much greater ages, up to 24 years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.

The garden warbler feeds mainly on insects in the breeding season, although other small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s such as spiders are also eaten. It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages at less than above the ground. After nesting, there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet, although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration; birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone. Berries and other soft fruit are preferred, and <a href="Common%20fig">figs</a> are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate. This predilection gives rise to the Italian "beccafico" (fig pecker) and Portuguese "felosa-das-figueiras" (fig-tree warbler) as names for this species. On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s for storage in <a href="adipose%20tissue">adipose tissue</a>.

In Africa, the warbler eats insects as well as berries, and the fruits of the introduced <a href="Lantana%20camara">Spanish flag</a> is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most <a href="internal%20organ">internal organ</a>s (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the <a href="testes">testes</a> quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from <a href="savanna">savanna</a> rather than the treeless <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> further north.

Fruit is normally picked by a perched bird, although there is a record of a <a href="Morus%20%28plant%29">mulberry</a> fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with <a href="conspecificity">conspecifics</a> and other fruit-eating <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s. Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.

The main predators of the garden warbler are <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s and domestic cats. Some <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s will also take adults, and the <a href="Eleonora%27s%20falcon">Eleonora's falcon</a> hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>s and <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">Eurasian magpie</a>s take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, <a href="least%20weasel">weasels</a> and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.

External parasites of the garden warbler include the <a href="flea">flea</a>s "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20gallinae">Ceratophyllus gallinae</a>" and "<a href="Moorhen%20flea">Dasypsyllus gallinulae</a>" and the <a href="mite">mite</a> "<a href="Syringophilosis%20borini">Syringophilosis borini</a>", named after its host. Two species of <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>n parasites in the genus "<a href="Isospora">Isospora</a>" occur in garden warblers, "<a href="Isospora%20sylvianthina">I. sylvianthina</a>" and "<a href="Isospora%20sylviae">I. sylviae</a>". Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, "<a href="Haemoproteus%20parabelopolskyi">Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi</a>" are found only in the garden warbler, and form a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.

The garden warbler has a very large range of 9,650,000 km (3,700,000 mi), and its population in Europe is estimated at 17–31 million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124 million individuals. There is no evidence of any serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

There has been a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, although the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.

In his "<a href="History%20of%20Animals">History of Animals</a>", <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> considered that the garden warbler eventually <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosed</a> into a <a href="blackcap">blackcap</a>. The composer <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a> used the song of the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece "<a href="La%20fauvette%20des%20jardins">La fauvette des jardins</a>", the title being the French name of the species. His <a href="Turangal%C3%AEla-Symphonie">Turangalîla-Symphonie</a>, a major work inspired by the legend of <a href="Tristan%20and%20Iseult">Tristan and Iseult</a>, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features the song of the warbler, along with those of the nightingale and <a href="common%20blackbird">blackbird</a>.

The garden warbler is prized as a gastronomic delicacy in Mediterranean countries. French <a href="Ethicurean">epicure</a> <a href="Jean%20Anthelme%20Brillat-Savarin">Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</a> said of the warbler when cooked like <a href="ortolan%20bunting">ortolan bunting</a> "if it were the size of a pheasant, it would be worth an acre of land". An Italian stuffed sardine dish "sarde a beccafico" derives its name from its supposed resemblance to the cooked birds, known in that country as "beccafico", fig-pecker.

Old names for the garden warbler, such as strawsmear, small straw and haychat, are often derived from its choice of nesting material, although the commonest of the English folk names was "pettychaps". These names were often shared with other warblers including the blackcap, common whitethroat and <a href="common%20chiffchaff">common chiffchaff</a>.

Tree swallow

The tree swallow ("Tachycineta bicolor") is a <a href="Bird%20migration">migratory bird</a> of the family <a href="Hirundinidae">Hirundinidae</a>. Found in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, the tree swallow was first described in 1807 by French <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="Louis%20Vieillot">Louis Vieillot</a> as "Hirundo bicolor". It has since been moved to its current genus, "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>", where its phylogenetic placement is in debate. The tree swallow has glossy blue-green , with the exception of the blackish wings and tail, and white . The bill is black, the eyes are dark brown, and the legs and feet are pale brown. The female is generally duller than the male, and the first-year female has mostly brown upperparts, with some blue feathers. Juveniles have brown upperparts, and a grey-brown-washed breast. The tree swallow breeds in the US and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. It winters along southern US coasts south, along the Gulf Coast, to Panama and the northwestern coast of South America, and in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>.

The tree swallow nests either in isolated pairs or loose groups, in both natural and artificial cavities. Breeding can start as soon as early May, although this date is advancing because of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, and it can end as late as July. This bird is generally <a href="socially%20monogamous">socially monogamous</a> (although about 8% of males are <a href="polygynous">polygynous</a>), with high levels of <a href="extra-pair%20paternity">extra-pair paternity</a>. This can benefit the male, but since the female controls copulation, the lack of resolution on how this behaviour benefits females makes the high level of extra-pair paternity puzzling. The female incubates the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of two to eight (but usually four to seven) pure white eggs, usually for 14 to 15 days. The chicks hatch slightly asynchronously, allowing for the female to prioritize which chicks to feed in times of food shortage. The chicks generally fledge about 18 to 22 days after hatching. The tree swallow is sometimes considered a <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>, due to the large amount of research done on it.

An aerial , the tree swallow forages both alone and in groups, eating mostly <a href="insect">insect</a>s. <a href="Mollusc">Mollusc</a>s, <a href="spider">spider</a>s, and fruit are also found in the diet. The nestlings, like the adult, primarily eat insects, fed to it by both the male and the female. This <a href="swallow">swallow</a> is vulnerable to parasites, but, when on nestlings, these do little damage. The effect of disease can become stronger as a tree swallow gets older, as some parts of the immune system decline with age. Acquired <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>-mediated immunity, for example, decreases with age, whereas both innate and acquired <a href="humoral%20immunity">humoral immunity</a> do not. Because of its large range and stable population, the tree swallow is considered to be <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. In the US, it is protected by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, and in Canada by the <a href="Migratory%20Birds%20Convention%20Act">Migratory Birds Convention Act</a>. This swallow is negatively affected by human activities, such as the clearing of forests; <a href="acidified%20lakes">acidified lakes</a> can force a breeding tree swallow to go long distances to find calcium-rich food items to feed to its chicks.

The tree swallow was described as "Hirundo bicolor" by <a href="Louis%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Pierre Vieillot</a> in his "Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amérique Septentrionale", published in 1807. The genus it is currently placed in, "<a href="Tachycineta">Tachycineta</a>", was established by <a href="Jean%20Cabanis">Jean Cabanis</a> in 1850. This <a href="swallow">swallow</a> is sometimes placed in the genus "Iridoprocne", along with the <a href="mangrove%20swallow">mangrove swallow</a>, <a href="white-rumped%20swallow">white-rumped swallow</a>, <a href="white-winged%20swallow">white-winged swallow</a>, and Chilean swallow. The placement was first made by <a href="Elliott%20Coues">Elliott Coues</a>, on the basis of its plumage. The tree swallow is also called the white-bellied swallow, for its white underparts.

The generally accepted genus name is from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "takhykinetos", "moving quickly", and the specific "bicolor" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and means "two-coloured". The other genus name, "Iridoprocne", comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "iris", meaning rainbow, and <a href="Procne">Procne</a>, a figure who supposedly turned into a swallow.

The position of the tree swallow in relation to other members of "Tachycineta" is unresolved. In studies based on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, this bird was given <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> placement (meaning it was the first offshoot in the species tree) within the North American-Caribbean <a href="clade">clade</a>, i.e. it was basal to the <a href="violet-green%20swallow">violet-green swallow</a>, which itself was basal to the <a href="Golden%20swallow">golden</a> and <a href="Bahama%20swallow">Bahama swallow</a>. Although mitochondrial DNA is advocated to be a better indicator of evolutionary changes because of its short <a href="coalescence%20%28genetics%29">coalescence</a> time (the time ago that two random gene copies had a common ancestor), analyses based on it can suffer because mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the mother, thus likely making it worse than <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> from multiple <a href="locus%20%28genetics%29">loci</a> at representing the phylogeny of a whole group. A study based on such nuclear DNA, contrasting with mitochondrial DNA studies, placed the tree swallow in the most basal position within "Tachycineta" as a whole (as a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to the rest of the genus).

The tree swallow has a length between about and a weight of approximately . The male has mostly glossy blue-green , the wings and tail being blackish. The and the cheek patch are white, although the coverts are grey-brown. The bill is black, eyes are dark brown, and the legs and feet are pale brown. The female can be differentiated from the male as the former is duller, and sometimes has a brown forehead. The first-year female also has brown upperparts, with a variable number of blue feathers. This brown feathering likely has the function of allowing exploration of nest sites, as the male is usually less aggressive to a first-year female. The second-year female sometimes retains some of this brown feathering. The juveniles can be distinguished by their brown upperparts and grey-brown-washed breast.

The tree swallow's song is three long and descending notes ending with a liquid warble. This song is repeated. Its alarm call is a "peeh" or "pee-deeh"; this call can serve to silence older nestlings that are begging while a predator is near.

The tree swallow breeds in North America. Its range extends to north-central Alaska and up to the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a> in Canada. It is found as far south as Tennessee in the eastern part of its range, California and New Mexico in the west, and Kansas in the centre. It occasionally breeds further south in the US. The wintering range is primarily southern US coasts and south, along the Gulf Coast, to Panama and the northwestern coast of South America. It also is found wintering in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. Vagrants are sometimes found in the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, the northern <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a>, <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, and Europe. When a swallow returns to nest, it usually does not change breeding sites.

The habitat of this swallow is primarily in open and wooded areas, especially those near water. The fact that it is able to live in open areas is due to the construction of nest boxes in such regions.

Because of the numerous studies on various aspects of this bird's biology, it has been recommended that the tree swallow be considered a <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>. Although it is aggressive during the breeding season, the tree swallow is sociable outside of it, forming flocks sometimes numbering thousands of birds.

The tree swallow usually nests in the same area to breed again; only about 14% of females and 4% of males disperse to breed at a new site per year. This dispersal, though, is influenced by breeding success; of the breeders that fail to fledge a chick, about 28% disperse, compared to the 5% that disperse when they are successful. Most do not disperse far, usually breeding at sites less than away from their original grounds. It nests both in loose groups and isolated pairs. When nesting in loose groups, nests are usually spaced apart, and those that are closer in distance are usually further apart in terms of laying date. In natural cavities, the tree swallow nests about apart from its neighbor. After a nest is found in pre-existing holes, usually in trees and artificial structures such as pipes and fence posts, and in nestboxes, the male perches near it and calls frequently. A lack of nest sites can cause fights between birds, sometimes resulting in deaths. This bird usually defends an area around the nest with a radius of about , as well as extra nests inside of that . These territories are defended by blocking the entrance to the nest and by chasing intruders. The nest hole is, on average, above ground level, although about 45% of them are less than above the ground. The nest cup itself is made from grass, moss, pine needles, and aquatic plants, which are collected mostly by the female, and lined with feathers, which are mostly collected by the male in fights. The feathers may serve the function of insulating the nest, helping to decrease incubation time and likely preventing <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> in chicks. In addition to an increased mass at fledging for chicks, eggs cool slower in nests with feathers than those without. However, a study published in 2018 did not find a significant correlation between the number of feathers in nests that were artificially warmed versus those that were not. Additionally, it found that nests in <a href="St.%20Denis%2C%20Saskatchewan">St. Denis, Saskatchewan</a>, used significantly less feathers than those in <a href="Annapolis%20Valley">Annapolis Valley</a>, despite the former being further north.
Courtship starts with a male tree swallow attacking an unknown female; this can be stimulated by the female doing a wing-fluttering flight, which is possibly an invitation to court. The male may then take a vertical posture, with a raised tail, slightly spread, and with wings slightly drooped. This stimulates the female to try and land on the male's back, but he flies to prevent this; this is repeated. After the male courts the female, he flies to his chosen nest site, and the female inspects it. The pair bond takes time to develop. During copulation, the male hovers over the female, and then mounts her, giving aggression calls. He then makes with the female while holding her neck feathers in his bill and standing on her slightly outstretched wings. Copulation occurs multiple times.

Eggs are laid from early May to mid-June and chicks fledge between mid-June and July, although the laying date is getting later because of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. When the eggs are laid is influenced by latitude, age of the female, and wing length of the female, which allows it to forage more efficiently. On average, birds in the southern part of the breeding range breed earlier than those in the northern portion. The female's wing length and age are both inversely correlated with the timing of breeding. It generally lays when the temperature and the abundance of food (that the female can catch) are good enough for females to start laying eggs. These observations support the theory that the tree swallow is an <a href="income%20breeder">income breeder</a> (breeding based on food conditions during the laying season). This species is generally <a href="socially%20monogamous">socially monogamous</a>, but up to 8% of breeding males are <a href="polygynous">polygynous</a>. Polygyny is influenced by territory: males having territories with nestboxes at least apart are more likely to be polygynous. It is suggested that this polygyny depends on the conditions during the laying season: better conditions, such as an abundance of food, allow females in polygyny who do not receive help in foraging to lay more eggs.

The tree swallow has high rates of extra-pair paternity, 38% to 69% of nestlings being a product of extra-pair paternity, and 50% to 87% of broods containing at least one nestling that was the result of an extra-pair copulation. One factor that might contribute to this is that females have control over copulation, making paternity guards ineffective. Although this is true, a 2009 study found correlational evidence between the copulation frequency and how far away laying was in terms of time, and that this likely influenced the result of brood paternity, there being a correlation between within-pair copulation frequency and the proportion of young the within-pair male sired. But, a 1993 and 1994 study did not find this latter correlation when it was studied. Extra-pair paternity does not change the level of parental care the male contributes in the tree swallow, contrary to other birds. The tree swallow also differs in terms of the composition of extra-pair fathers; in a study that found the paternity of 35 extra-pair nestlings, it was determined that 25 extra-pair young were from fathers from sites near the nest where the female is, about three from sites within , and seven that had fathers that were floaters (those present at breeding grounds that presumably do not breed). In the tree swallow, floating thus helps males in good condition produce more chicks, while allowing males in bad condition to be successful through parental care.

How extra-pair fathers are chosen and why females even breed with other males (because they can control copulation) is controversial. One theory, called the genetic compatibility hypothesis, states that increased offspring fitness results from increased <a href="heterozygosity">heterozygosity</a>, and thus that female tree swallows would prefer to mate with males that have more different <a href="allele">allele</a>s from them. This theory is justified on the basis that young produced from extra-pair mates usually are more heterozygous than within-pair offspring. Further supporting this theory, females are likely able to judge, after copulation, whether or not a male's sperm is of high quality and whether she should allow it to impregnate her. Another theory, called the good genes theory, says that females choose extra-pair males based on if they have good genes that would influence survival and mating success. This is supported on the basis that it is able to explain why some tree swallows do not have any extra-pair young, whereas others do. Although this is true, there is criticism for a lack of <a href="phenotypic">phenotypic</a> difference between extra-pair males and pair-bonded males. But, there are results that may be in support of this theory. For example, in a 2007 study, it was found that increased plumage brightness and increased age in extra-pair males, together, increased the number of extra-pair young. Another theory suggests that extra-pair paternity is context dependent, meaning that extra-pair young outperform within-pair young in certain situations, whereas within-pair young do better than extra-pair young in other environments. For example, extra-pair young have less developmental plasticity compared to within-pair young, meaning that within-pair young outperform extra-pair young when both were born in relatively unchallenging environments.

Studies attempting to prove the adaptability of extra-pair paternity for females have been criticized for the lack of positive effect that increased offspring fitness would have when compared with the potential cost of decreased fitness for the female. Thus, theories based on the non-adaptivity of extra-pair paternity for females have been postulated. These theories are based on <a href="Biological%20constraints">genetic constraint</a>, where <a href="pleiotropy">pleiotropic effects</a> (when an allele affects multiple phenotypes) produce benefits to behaviours that are otherwise maladaptive. The theory of intersexual <a href="Antagonistic%20pleiotropy%20hypothesis">antagonistic pleiotropy</a> says that strong selection for extra-pair paternity in males (as seen in this bird) overrides the <a href="weak%20selection">weak selection</a> against extra-pair paternity in females. The hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, meanwhile, argues that extra-pair paternity is present because the genes regulating it have pleiotropic effects on aspects of female fitness, like within-pair copulation rate.
The tree swallow lays a clutch of two to eight, although usually four to seven, pure white, and translucent at laying, eggs that measure about . These eggs are incubated by the female, usually after the second-to-last egg is laid, for 11 to 20 days, although most hatch after 14 to 15 days. About 88% of nests produce at least one nestling, although this is lowered by poor weather and a younger breeding female. They hatch slightly asynchronously, with an average of 28 hours between the time the first and final egg is laid. The laying order predicts the hatching order, the eggs generally hatching in the order they were laid. When a brood hatches asynchronously, a weight hierarchy is established, the nestlings hatched earlier weighing more than those hatched later. This allows for the female to prioritize which chick to give food to in times of food shortage, although this weight difference is less pronounced about 12 days into nesting, suggesting that this brood-reduction only has a significant effect early in the nestling period. Infanticide of the chicks and eggs sometimes occurs when a male is replaced by another male. Infanticide usually does not occur when the clutch is not complete, as replacement males then have a chance to fertilize at least one egg. When the male arrives during incubation, it sometimes commits infanticide, but other times adopts the eggs, as there is a chance that some eggs were sired from the replacement male. If the replacement male arrives after the chicks hatch, infanticide is usually committed, though the female will sometimes prevent this.

Nests produced by females of better condition often have sex ratios skewed towards high quality males. This is hypothesized to be because males have more variability in reproductive success, thus meaning a female in better condition can produce a male in good condition that may have better reproductive success (more than that of a female of similar condition).

The growth of nestling tree swallows is influenced by their environment. The growth of younger nestlings—those two to four days old—is positively influenced by a higher maximum temperature and an older age, and negatively influenced by a later hatching date. In older nestlings—those from nine to eleven days of age—growth is positively influenced, albeit to a lesser extent, by a higher maximum temperature and more abundant insects, and negatively influenced, again to less effect, by a later hatching date and an older age. In terms of thermoregulation, nestling tree swallows are able to thermoregulate at a capacity of 75% compared to the adult at an average age of 9.5 days when out of the nest, and from nine to four days when in the nest (depending on the size of the brood). These nestlings generally fledge after 18 to 22 days, with about 80% fledging success. Like hatching success, this value is reduced by unfavourable weather and a younger female. Chicks may be preyed on by snakes and raccoons. This predation can be exacerbated by begging calls. For their first year, the tree swallow has an average annual mortality rate of 79%, and a rate of 40% to 60% afterwards. The maximum lifespan recorded for this bird is 12 years.

The tree swallow forages up to above the ground singly or in groups. Its flight is a mix of flapping and gliding. During the breeding season, this is mostly within of the nest site. When it is foraging for nestlings, though, it usually goes up to from the nest, mostly staying in sight of it, and forages at a height up to . As well as being caught in flight, insects are sometimes taken from the ground, water, vegetation, and vertical surfaces.

The tree swallow eats mostly insects, with some molluscs, spiders, and fruit. In North America, flies make up about 40% of the diet, supplemented with beetles and ants. Otherwise, the diet is about 90% flies. The insects taken are a mix of aquatic and terrestrial organisms; the former is an important source of <a href="omega-3%20fatty%20acid">omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid</a>s. This is because, although the tree swallow can convert the precursor <a href="%CE%B1-Linolenic%20acid">α-Linolenic acid</a> into high unsaturated fatty acids like <a href="docosahexaenoic%20acid">docosahexaenoic acid</a>, it cannot do so in the quantities needed. The seed and berry food is mainly from the genus "<a href="Myrica">Myrica</a>", which is mainly taken in all four of the Northern Hemisphere seasons except summer. Crustaceans were also found to be important in the wintering diet in a study on <a href="Long%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Long Island, New York</a>.

Both sexes feed the nestlings, although the male feeds the chicks less than the females. There are about 10 to 20 feedings per hour. The hatching order affects how much a chick is fed; last-hatched nestlings (in cases where hatching is asynchronous) are likely fed less than those hatched earlier. Nestlings closer to the entrance of the nest are also more likely to be fed, as are those who started begging first. The diet itself is composed mostly of insects, those in the orders <a href="Diptera">Diptera</a>, <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>, and <a href="Odonata">Odonata</a> making up most of the diet. These insects are mostly up to in size, but sometimes are up to in length. In nests near lakes <a href="Freshwater%20acidification">acidified</a> by humans, calcium supplements, primarily fish bones, crayfish <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s, clam shells, and the shells of bird eggs, are harder to find. This forces the adult tree swallow to travel further than usual—sometimes up to away from the nest—to get these calcium supplements.

Despite its aerial skills, the tree swallows is susceptible to a wide range of predators, especially near their nests. Variously eggs, nestlings and (sometimes) adults are known to fall victim to <a href="Pantherophis%20obsoletus">black rat snakes</a>, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s, as well as <a href="chipmunk">chipmunk</a>s, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, <a href="domestic%20cat">domestic cat</a>s, and <a href="Peromyscus">deermice</a>. Raptorial birds are considered the main threat to this swallow. When it is flying, <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>s, kestrels, <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">merlins</a>, <a href="prairie%20falcon">prairie falcon</a>s and <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s are predators, while perched and roosting birds are sometimes ambushed by <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s, <a href="barred%20owl">barred owl</a>s, <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s, <a href="red-shouldered%20hawk">red-shouldered hawk</a>s, <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s and <a href="black-billed%20magpie">black-billed magpie</a>s. Whilst evasive flight is the usual antipredator response in free-flying swallows, mobbing behavior is common around the nest. A mobbing swallow rarely contacts the predator, instead swarming and dive bombing predators while making aggressive calls. It seems to alter the intensity of its attacks based on which predator approaches, with snakes and raptorial birds often drawing the most spirited attacks. It is likely that the tree swallow selects roosting sites in part by their accessibility by predators.

The tree swallow is vulnerable to various parasites, such as the blood parasite "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>". It is also susceptible to the flea "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20idius">Ceratophyllus idius</a>" and the feather mites "<a href="Pteronyssoides%20tyrrelli">Pteronyssoides tyrrelli</a>", "<a href="Trouessartia">Trouessartia</a>", and (likely) "<a href="Hemialges">Hemialges</a>". It is also probably afflicted by lice of the genera "<a href="Brueelia">Brueelia</a>" and "<a href="Myrsidea">Myrsidea</a>". There is a correlation between the number of fleas on a bird and the number of young it is caring for. This relationship is speculated to be a cause of an improved microclimate for fleas due to a larger clutch. Nestlings also suffer from parasites, like <a href="blow-fly">blow-flies</a> of the genus "<a href="Protocalliphora">Protocalliphora</a>", which results in a loss of blood by nestlings. These parasites, though, do not seem to have a significant effect on nestlings, and are found in a majority of nests. A study published in 1992 found that only 5.5% of the variation in nestling mass could be explained by the effects of parasitism.

In the breeding female tree swallow, humoral <a href="immunocompetence">immunocompetence</a> (HIC) is inversely correlated with laying date. This means that, on average, a bird that lays its egg earlier has a stronger antibiotic response to an <a href="antigen">antigen</a> than a bird that lays its egg later. A tree swallow that is handicapped by wing-clipping generally has a lower HIC. These relationships could be interpreted as supporting the conclusion that a female that lays earlier acquires a higher HIC, but the authors of the study that found the correlations believed this unlikely. Instead, they thought it showed that a better quality female is able to lay earlier due to that quality. The fact that a handicapped bird has a higher HIC suggests that it is sensitive to increases in workload.

In the tree swallow, some components of the immune system deteriorate with age. Acquired <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>-mediated immunity, for example, declines with age in the female tree swallow. But, the age of a female does not affect both the acquired and innate <a href="humoral%20immunity">humoral immunity</a>. The lack of deterioration in the former contrasts with some other studies of passerines. Because of this immunosenescence (a decrease in immune function with age), older females infected with a disease can visit their nest less and this can have a more pronounced effect on the growth of the nestlings than an infection in a younger female. Older females are also likely to lose weight because of an infection.

The tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. This is due to the bird's large range of about , and its stable population, estimated to be about 20,000,000 individuals. It is protected in the US by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, and in Canada by the <a href="Migratory%20Birds%20Convention%20Act">Migratory Birds Convention Act</a>. In some parts of the US, the range of this swallow has extended south, likely due to changes in land use, the reintroduction of beavers, and nestboxes installed for <a href="bluebird">bluebird</a>s. Tree swallows are negatively impacted by the clearing of forests, and there is a documented impact of the reduction of marshes, which reduce the habitat available for wintering. The tree swallow also has to compete for nest sites with the <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a> and <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>, both introduced to <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Acidification of lakes can force it to go relatively long distances to find calcium-rich items, and can result in chicks eating plastic. Other chemicals, like pesticides and other pollutants, can become highly concentrated in eggs, and <a href="Polychlorinated%20biphenyl">PCB</a>s are associated with the abandonment of a pair's clutch.

Cosmo Gordon Lang

William Cosmo Gordon Lang, 1st Baron Lang of Lambeth, (31 October 1864 – 5 December 1945), known as Cosmo Gordon Lang, was a Scottish <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> <a href="prelate">prelate</a> who served as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> (1908–1928) and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> (1928–1942). During the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdication crisis</a> of 1936, he took a strong moral stance, his comments in a subsequent broadcast being widely condemned as uncharitable towards the departed king.

The son of a Scots <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Presbyterian</a> minister, Lang abandoned the prospect of a legal and political career to train for the <a href="Anglican%20ministry">Anglican priesthood</a>. Beginning in 1890, his early ministry was served in slum parishes in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> and <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, except for brief service as an <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> college chaplain. In 1901 he was appointed <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Stepney">Bishop of Stepney</a> in London, where he continued his work among the poor. He also served as a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, London.

In 1908 Lang was nominated as Archbishop of York, despite his relatively junior status as a <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a> rather than a <a href="diocesan%20bishop">diocesan</a> bishop. His religious stance was broadly <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a>, tempered by the <a href="liberal%20Anglo-Catholicism">liberal Anglo-Catholicism</a> advocated in the "<a href="Lux%20Mundi%20%28book%29">Lux Mundi</a>" essays. He consequently entered the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> as a <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lord Spiritual</a> and caused consternation in traditionalist circles by speaking and voting against the Lords' proposal to reject <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>'s 1909 "<a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a>". This radicalism was not maintained in subsequent years. At the start of the First World War, Lang was heavily criticised for a speech in which he spoke sympathetically of the <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a>. This troubled him greatly and may have contributed to the rapid ageing which affected his appearance during the war years. After the war he began to promote church unity and at the 1920 <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> was responsible for the Church's Appeal to All Christian People. As Archbishop of York he supported controversial proposals for the <a href="1928%20Prayer%20Book">1928 revision</a> of the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> but, after acceding to Canterbury, he took no practical steps to resolve this issue.

Lang became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1928. He presided over the <a href="1930%20Lambeth%20Conference">1930 Lambeth Conference</a>, which gave limited church approval to the use of <a href="contraception">contraception</a>. After denouncing the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Italian invasion</a> of <a href="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</a> in 1935 and strongly condemning European <a href="anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a>, Lang later supported the <a href="Appeasement%23The%20conduct%20of%20appeasement%2C%201937%E2%80%9339">appeasement</a> policies of the British government. In May 1937 he presided over the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</a>. On retirement in 1942 Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth and continued to attend and speak in House of Lords debates until his death in 1945. Lang himself believed that he had not lived up to his own high standards. Others have praised his qualities of industry, his efficiency and his commitment to his calling.

Cosmo Gordon Lang was born in 1864 at the <a href="manse">manse</a> in <a href="Fyvie">Fyvie</a>, <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, the third son of the local <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> minister, the Reverend <a href="John%20Marshall%20Lang">John Marshall Lang</a>, and his wife Hannah Agnes Lang. Cosmo was baptised at Fyvie church by a neighbouring minister, the name "William" being added inadvertently to his given names, perhaps because the local <a href="laird">laird</a> was called William Cosmo Gordon. The additional name was rarely used subsequently. In January 1865 the family moved to <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> on John Lang's appointment as a minister in the <a href="Anderston">Anderston</a> district. Subsequent moves followed: in 1868 to <a href="Morningside%2C%20Edinburgh">Morningside</a>, Edinburgh and, in 1873, back to Glasgow when John Lang was appointed minister to the historic <a href="Barony%20Church">Barony Church</a>.

In Glasgow, Lang attended the Park School, a day establishment where he won a prize for an essay on English literature and played the occasional game of football; otherwise, he recorded, "I was never greatly interested in [the school's] proceedings." Holidays were spent in different parts of Scotland, most notably in <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a> to which, later in life, Lang would frequently return. In 1878, at the age of 14, Lang sat and passed his <a href="matriculation">matriculation</a> examinations. Despite his youth, he began his studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> later that year.

At the university Lang's tutors included some of Scotland's leading academics: the Greek scholar <a href="Richard%20Claverhouse%20Jebb">Richard Claverhouse Jebb</a>, the physicist <a href="Sir%20William%20Thomson">William Thomson</a> (who was later created Lord Kelvin) and the philosopher <a href="Edward%20Caird">Edward Caird</a>. Long afterwards Lang commented on the inability of some of these eminent figures to handle "the Scottish boors who formed a large part of their classes". Lang was most strongly influenced by Caird, who gave the boy's mind "its first real awakening". Lang recalled how, in a revelation as he was passing through <a href="Kelvingrove%20Park">Kelvingrove Park</a>, he expressed aloud his sudden conviction that: "The Universe is one and its Unity and Ultimate Reality is God!" He acknowledged that his greatest failure at the University was his inability to make any progress in his understanding of mathematics, "to me, then and always, unintelligible".

In 1881 Lang made his first trip outside Scotland, to London where he heard the theologian and orator <a href="Henry%20Parry%20Liddon">Henry Parry Liddon</a> preach in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. He also heard <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> debating in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>. Later that year he travelled to Cambridge to stay with a friend who was studying there. A visit to <a href="King%27s%20College%20Chapel">King's College Chapel</a> persuaded Lang that he should study at the College; the following January he sat and passed the entrance examination. When he discovered that as part of his degree studies he would be examined in mathematics, his enthusiasm disappeared. Instead, he applied to <a href="Balliol%20College">Balliol College</a>, Oxford, and was accepted. In mid-1882 he ended his studies at Glasgow with a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Scotland%29">Master of Arts</a> degree, and was awarded prizes for essays on politics and church history.

Lang started at Balliol in October 1882. In his first term he successfully sat for the Brakenbury Scholarship, described by his biographer John Gilbert Lockhart as "the Blue Ribbon of history scholarship at any University of the British Isles". In February 1883 his first speech at the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>, against the <a href="disestablishmentarianism">disestablishment</a> of the Church of Scotland, was warmly received; the chairman likened his oratory to that of the Ancient Greek statesman, <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>. He became <a href="President%20of%20the%20Oxford%20Union">the Union's president</a> in the <a href="Trinity%20term">Trinity term</a> of 1883, and the following year was a co-founder of the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Dramatic%20Society">Oxford University Dramatic Society</a> (OUDS). He was also a founding member of the highly exclusive <a href="Stubbs%20Society">Stubbs Society</a>.

Although Lang considered himself forward-thinking, he joined and became secretary of the Canning Club, the university's principal <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> society. His contemporary <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cecil%20of%20Chelwood">Robert Cecil</a> recorded that Lang's "progressive" opinions were somewhat frowned upon by traditional <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Tories</a>, who nevertheless respected his ability. Lang later assisted in the founding of the University settlement of <a href="Toynbee%20Hall">Toynbee Hall</a>, a mission to help the poor in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>. He had been first drawn to this work in 1883, after listening to a sermon in St Mary's Church, Oxford, by <a href="Samuel%20Augustus%20Barnett">Samuel Augustus Barnett</a>, Vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel. Barnett became the settlement's first leader, while Lang became one of its first undergraduate secretaries. He spent so much time on these duties that he was chided by the Master of Balliol, <a href="Benjamin%20Jowett">Benjamin Jowett</a>, for neglecting his studies. In 1886 Lang graduated with <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">first-class honours</a> in History; in October he failed to secure a Fellowship of <a href="All%20Souls%20College">All Souls College</a>, blaming his poor early scholastic training in Glasgow.

Lang's career ambition from early in life was to practise law, enter politics and then take office in some future Conservative administration. In 1887 he began his studies for the English Bar, working in the London chambers of <a href="William%20Robson%2C%20Baron%20Robson">W.S. Robson</a>, a future <a href="Attorney-General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney-General</a>, whose "vehement radicalism was an admirable stimulus and corrective to [Lang's] liberal Conservatism". During these years Lang was largely aloof from religion, but continued churchgoing out of what he termed "hereditary respect". He attended services at the <a href="Nonconformism">nonconformist</a> <a href="City%20Temple%20%28London%29">City Temple</a> church and sometimes went to St Paul's Cathedral. Of his life at that time he said: "I must confess that I played sometimes with those external temptations that our Christian London flaunts in the face of its young men."

In October 1888 Lang was elected to an All Souls Fellowship, and began to divide his time between London and Oxford. Some of his Oxford friends were training for ordination and Lang was often drawn into their discussions. Eventually the question entered Lang's mind: "Why shouldn't "you" be ordained?" The thought persisted, and one Sunday evening in early 1889, after a visit to the <a href="Cuddesdon%20College">theological college at Cuddesdon</a>, Lang attended evening service at the Cuddesdon parish church. By his own account, during the sermon he was gripped by "a masterful inward voice" which told him "You are wanted. You are called. You must obey." He immediately severed his connection with the Bar, renounced his political ambitions and applied for a place at Cuddesdon College. With the help of an All Souls contact, the essential step of his <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a> into the Church of England was supervised by the <a href="Edward%20King%20%28English%20bishop%29">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. Lang's decision to become an Anglican and seek ordination disappointed his Presbyterian father, who nevertheless wrote to his son: "What you think, prayerfully and solemnly, you ought to do – you must do – we will accept."

After a year's study at <a href="Ripon%20College%20Cuddesdon">Cuddesdon</a>, Lang was ordained as <a href="deacon">deacon</a>. He rejected an offer of the chaplaincy of All Souls as he wanted to be "up and doing" in a tough parish. Lang identified with the <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> tradition of the Church of England, in part, he admitted, as a reaction against his <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> upbringing in the Church of Scotland. His sympathies lay with the progressive wing of Anglo-Catholicism represented by the "<a href="Lux%20Mundi%20%28book%29">Lux Mundi</a>" essays, published in 1888 by a group of forward-looking Oxford theologians. Among these was <a href="Edward%20Stuart%20Talbot">Edward Stuart Talbot</a>, Warden of <a href="Keble%20College%2C%20Oxford">Keble</a>, who in 1888 had become Vicar of <a href="Leeds%20Parish%20Church">Leeds Parish Church</a>. Talbot had contributed the essay entitled "The Preparation for History in Christ" in "Lux Mundi". On ordination Lang eagerly accepted the offer of a <a href="curate">curacy</a> under Talbot, and arrived in Leeds in late 1890.

<a href="Leeds%20Parish%20Church">Leeds Parish Church</a>, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1841 after an elaborate ceremony, was of almost cathedral size, the centre of a huge parish ministered by many <a href="curate">curate</a>s. Lang's district was the Kirkgate, one of the poorest areas, many of whose 2,000 inhabitants were prostitutes. Lang and his fellow curates fashioned a clergy house from a derelict <a href="public%20house">public house</a>. He later moved next door, into a condemned property which became his home for his remaining service in Leeds. In addition to his normal parish duties, Lang acted temporarily as Principal of the <a href="Leeds%20Clergy%20School">Clergy School</a>, was chaplain to Leeds Infirmary, and took charge of a men's club of around a hundred members. On 24 May 1891 he was ordained to full priesthood.

Lang continued to visit Oxford when time allowed and on a visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at <a href="Magdalen%20College%2C%20Oxford">Magdalen College</a>. Other offers were open to him; the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Newcastle">Bishop of Newcastle</a> wished to appoint him vicar of the <a href="Newcastle%20Cathedral">cathedral church in Newcastle</a> and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.

As Magdalen's Dean of Divinity (college chaplain), Lang had <a href="pastoral%20care">pastoral duties</a> with the college's undergraduates and responsibility for the chapel and its choir. Lang was delighted with this latter obligation; his concern for the purity of the choir's sound led him to request that visitors "join in the service silently". In 1894 Lang was asked to add to his workload by acting as Vicar of the <a href="University%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin">University Church of St Mary the Virgin</a>, where <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a> had begun his Oxford ministry in 1828. The church had almost ceased to function when Lang took it over, but he revived regular services, chose preachers with care and slowly rebuilt the congregation. In December 1895 he was offered the post of Vicar of <a href="Portsea%2C%20Portsmouth">Portsea</a>, a large parish within <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on the south coast, but he was not ready to leave Oxford and refused. Some months later he had further thoughts; the strain of his dual appointment in Oxford was beginning to tell and, he claimed, "the thought of this great parish [of Portsea] and work going a-begging troubled my conscience." After discovering that the Portsea offer was still open, he decided to accept, though with some misgiving.

Portsea, covering much of the town of Portsmouth, was a dockside parish of around 40,000 inhabitants with a mixture of housing ranging from neat terraces to squalid slums. The large, recently rebuilt church held more than 2,000 people. Lang arrived in June 1896 to lead a team of more than a dozen curates serving the five districts of the parish. He quickly resumed the kind of urban parish work he had carried out in Leeds; he founded a Sunday afternoon men's conference with 300 men, and supervised the construction of a large conference hall as a centre for parish activities. He also pioneered the establishment of parochial church councils long before they were given legal status in 1919. Outside his normal parish duties, Lang served as chaplain to the local prison, and became acting chaplain to the 2nd Hampshire <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> Volunteer Corps.

Lang's relationship with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes spent too much time on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian <a href="Adrian%20Hastings">Adrian Hastings</a> singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of "extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism". Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature "Cosmo Cantuar" during a relaxed discussion with his curates ("Cantuar" is part of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>'s formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> to preach at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a>, her <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> home. Afterwards he talked with the Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates cost too much. He added: "If a curate proves unsatisfactory I can get rid of him. A wife is a fixture." He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an <a href="Honorary%20Chaplain%20to%20the%20Queen">Honorary Chaplain to the Queen</a>. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. As one of the Queen's chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.

In March 1901 Lang was appointed <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Stepney">Bishop of Stepney</a> and a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of St Paul's Cathedral. These appointments reflected his growing reputation and recognised his successful ministry in working-class parishes. He was <a href="Consecration%23Various%20Christian%20churches">consecrated</a> bishop by the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Frederick%20Temple">Frederick Temple</a>, in St Paul's Cathedral, on 1 May; his time would subsequently be divided between his work in the Stepney region and his duties at St Paul's.
The <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> honoured him with the degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Divinity">Doctor of Divinity</a> in late May 1901.

Lang's region of Stepney within the Diocese of London extended over the whole area generally known as London's <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a>, with two million people in more than 200 parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.

Lang's liberal conservatism enabled him to associate easily with Socialist leaders such as <a href="Will%20Crooks">Will Crooks</a> and <a href="George%20Lansbury">George Lansbury</a>, successive mayors of <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a>; he was responsible for bringing the latter back to regular communion in the Church. In 1905 he and Lansbury joined the Central London Unemployed Body, set up by the government to tackle the region's unemployment problems. That same year Lang took as his personal assistant a young Cambridge graduate and clergyman's son, <a href="Hugh%20Richard%20Lawrie%20Sheppard">Dick Sheppard</a>, who became a close friend and confidante. Sheppard was eventually ordained, becoming a radical clergyman and founder of the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>. Lang believed that socialism was a growing force in British life, and at a <a href="Church%20Congress">Church Congress</a> in <a href="Great%20Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a> in 1907 he speculated on how the Church should respond to this. His remarks reached "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", which warned that modern socialism was often equated with unrest, that "the cry of the demagogue is in the air" and that the Church should not heed this cry.

Much of the work in the district was supported by the East London Church Fund, established in 1880 to provide for additional clergy and lay workers in the poorest districts. Lang preached in wealthier parishes throughout Southern England, and urged his listeners to contribute to the Fund. He resumed his ministry to the army when, in 1907, he was appointed Honorary Chaplain to the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Imperial%20Yeomanry%20%28Rough%20Riders%29">City of London Imperial Yeomanry (Rough Riders)</a>. He became chairman of the <a href="Church%20of%20England%20Men%27s%20Society">Church of England Men's Society</a> (CEMS), which had been founded in 1899 by the merger of numerous organisations doing the same work. Initially he found it "a very sickly infant", but under his leadership it expanded rapidly, and soon had over 20,000 members in 600 branches. Later he became critical of the Church's failure to use this movement effectively, calling it one of the Church's lost opportunities.

Lang's appointment as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral required him to spend three months annually as the canon in residence, with administrative and preaching duties. Following his appointment as canon, he was also appointed Treasurer of the Cathedral. His preaching on Sunday afternoons caught the attention of <a href="William%20Temple%20%28archbishop%29">William Temple</a>, Lang's future successor at both York and Canterbury, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford. Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London's sermons, listening to Lang brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: "I can remember all his points, just because their connexion is inevitable... And for me, there is no doubt that this is the more edifying by far." Lang was a member of the cathedral's governing body, the Dean and Chapter, and was responsible for the organisation of special occasions, such as the service of thanksgiving for King <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VII</a>'s recovery from <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> in July 1902.

In late 1908 Lang was informed of his election as <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Montreal">Bishop of Montreal</a>. Letters from the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a> and the <a href="High%20Commissioner%20for%20Canada%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Canadian High Commissioner</a> urged him to accept, but the Archbishop of Canterbury asked him to refuse. A few weeks later a letter from <a href="Herbert%20Henry%20Asquith">Herbert Asquith</a>, the prime minister, informed Lang that he had been nominated <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>. Lang was only 44 years old, and had no experience as a diocesan bishop. On the issue of age, the "<a href="Church%20Times">Church Times</a>" believed that Asquith deliberately recommended the youngest bishop available, after strong political lobbying for the appointment of the elderly <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, <a href="John%20Percival%20%28bishop%29">John Percival</a>. Such a promotion for a suffragan, and within so short a period after ordination, was without recent precedent in the Church of England. Lang's friend <a href="Hensley%20Henson">Hensley Henson</a>, a future <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, wrote: "I am, of course, surprised that you go "straight" to an archbishopric ... But you are too meteoric for precedent." The appointment was generally well received, although the <a href="Protestant%20Truth%20Society">Protestant Truth Society</a> sought in vain to prevent its confirmation. Strong opponents of Anglo-Catholic practices, they maintained that as Bishop of Stepney Lang had "connived at and encouraged flagrant breaking of the law relating to church ritual".

Lang was enthroned at <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> on 25 January 1909. In 18 years since ordination he had risen to the second-highest position in the Church of England. In addition to his diocesan responsibilities for York itself, he became head of the entire <a href="Province%20of%20York">Northern Province</a>, and a member of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Believing that the <a href="Diocese%20of%20York">Diocese of York</a> was too large, he proposed reducing it by forming a new <a href="Diocese%20of%20Sheffield">Diocese of Sheffield</a>, which after several years' work was inaugurated in 1914. In the years following his appointment, Lang spoke out on a range of social and economic issues, and in support of improved working conditions. After taking his seat in the House of Lords in February 1909, he made his maiden speech in November in the debate on the controversial <a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a>, advising the Lords against their intention to reject this measure. He cast his first Lords vote against rejection, because he was "deeply convinced of the unwisdom of the course the Lords proposed to take". Although his speech was received with respect, Lang's stance was politely reproved by the leading Conservative peer <a href="Lord%20Curzon">Lord Curzon</a>.

Despite this socially progressive stance, Lang's political instincts remained conservative. He voted against the <a href="Home%20Rule%20Act%201914">1914 Irish Home Rule Bill</a> and opposed liberalisation of the divorce laws. After playing a prominent role in <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V's</a> coronation in 1911, Lang became increasingly close to the Royal Family, an association which drew the comment that he was "more courtier than cleric". His love of ceremony, and concern for how an archbishop should look and live, began to obscure other aspects of his ministry; rather than assuming the role of the people's prelate he began, in the words of his biographer Alan Wilkinson, to act as a "prince of the church".

When war broke out in August 1914, Lang concluded that the conflict was righteous, and that younger clergy should be encouraged to serve as military chaplains, although it was not their duty to fight. He thereafter was active in recruiting campaigns throughout his province. At a meeting in York in November 1914 he caused offence when he spoke out against excessive anti-German propaganda, and recalled a "sacred memory" of the <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a> kneeling with King Edward VII at the bier of Queen Victoria. These remarks, perceived as pro-German, produced what Lang termed "a perfect hail of denunciation". The strain of this period, coupled with the onset of <a href="alopecia">alopecia</a>, drastically altered Lang's relatively youthful appearance to that of a bald and elderly-looking man. His friends were shocked; the king, meeting him on the Royal train, apparently burst into guffaws of laughter.

Public hostility against Lang was slow to subside, re-emerging from time to time throughout the war. Lang continued his contribution to the war effort, paying visits to the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> and to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. He applied all his organisational skills to the Archbishop of Canterbury's National Mission of Repentance and Hope, an initiative designed to renew Christian faith nationwide, but it failed to make a significant impact.

As a result of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281917%29">Battle of Jerusalem</a> of December 1917, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>'s <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a> captured the <a href="Jerusalem">Holy City</a>, bringing it under Christian control for the first time since the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>. As Prelate of the <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Venerable Order of Saint John</a>, Lang led a service of celebration on 11 January 1918 at the Order's Grand Priory Church, <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>. He explained that it was 917 years since the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Order's hospital</a> had been founded in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and 730 years since they were driven out by <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>. "London is the city of the <a href="British%20Empire">Empire</a>'s commerce, but Jerusalem is the city of the soul, and it is particularly fitting that <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armies</a> should have delivered it out of the hands of the <a href="infidel">infidel</a>."

Early in 1918, at the invitation of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church of the United States</a>, he made a goodwill visit to America, praising the extent and willingness of America's participation in the war. The "Westminster Gazette" called this "one of the most moving and memorable visits ever paid by an Englishman to the United States".

After the war, Lang's primary cause was that of church unity. In 1920, as chairman of the Reunion Committee at the Sixth <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a>, he promoted an "Appeal to all Christian People", described by Hastings as "one of the rare historical documents that does not get forgotten with the years". It was unanimously adopted as the Conference's Resolution 9, and ended: "We ... ask that all should unite in a new and great endeavour to recover and to manifest to the world the unity of the Body of Christ for which He prayed." Despite initial warmth from the English <a href="Nonconformism%23Today">Free Churches</a>, little could be achieved in terms of practical union between <a href="episcopal%20polity">episcopal</a> and non-episcopal churches, and the initiative was allowed to lapse. Historically, the Appeal is considered the starting-point for the more successful <a href="ecumenism">ecumenical</a> efforts of later generations.

Lang was supportive of the <a href="Malines%20Conversations">Malines Conversations</a> of 1921–26, though not directly involved. These were informal meetings between leading British Anglo-Catholics and reform-minded European Roman Catholics, exploring the possibility of reuniting the Anglican and Roman communions. Although the discussions had the blessing of <a href="Randall%20Davidson">Randall Davidson</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelicals</a> were alarmed by them. Ultimately, the talks foundered on the entrenched opposition of the Catholic <a href="ultramontanism">ultramontanes</a>. A by-product of these conversations may have been the awakening of opposition to the revision of the Anglican <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Prayer Book</a>. The focus of this revision, which Lang supported, was to make concessions to Anglo-Catholic rituals and practices in the Anglican service. The new Prayer Book was overwhelmingly approved by the Church's main legislative body, the <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Church Assembly</a>, and by the House of Lords. Partly through the advocacy of the fervently evangelical <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Sir%20William%20Joynson-Hicks">Sir William Joynson-Hicks</a>, the revision was twice defeated in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, in December 1927 by 238 votes to 205 and, in June 1928, by 266 to 220. Lang was deeply disappointed, writing that "the gusts of Protestant convictions, suspicions, fears [and] prejudices swept through the House, and ultimately prevailed."

On 26 April 1923 King George V awarded Lang the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Chain">Royal Victorian Chain</a>, an honour in the personal gift of the Sovereign After the marriage of the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Duke of York</a> in 1923, Lang formed a friendship with the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20the%20Queen%20Mother">Duchess</a> which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. In 1926 he baptised Princess Elizabeth, the future <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, in the private chapel of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. In January 1927 Lang took centre-stage in the elaborate ceremonies which marked the 1,300th anniversary of the founding of <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>.

Archbishop Davidson resigned in July 1928 (he is believed to have been the first Archbishop of Canterbury ever to retire voluntarily). On 26 July Lang was notified by the Prime Minister, <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, that he would be the successor; William Temple would succeed Lang at York. Lang was enthroned as the new Archbishop of Canterbury on 4 December 1928, the first bachelor to hold the appointment in 150 years. A contemporary "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine article described Lang as "forthright and voluble" and as looking "like George Washington". Lang's first three years at Canterbury were marked by intermittent illnesses, which required periods of convalescence away from his duties. After 1932, he enjoyed good health for the rest of his life.

Lang avoided continuation of the Prayer Book controversy of 1928 by allowing the parliamentary process to lapse. He then authorised a statement permitting use of the rejected Book locally if the parochial church council gave approval. The issue remained dormant for the rest of Lang's tenure at Canterbury. He led the 1930 Lambeth Conference, where further progress was made in improving relations with the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a>es and the <a href="Old%20Catholic%20Church">Old Catholics</a>, although again no agreement could be reached with the non-episcopal Free Churches. On an issue of greater concern to ordinary people, the Conference gave limited approval, for the first time, to the use of contraceptive devices, an issue in which Lang had no interest. Through the 1930s Lang continued to work for Church unity. In 1933 the Church of England assembly formed a Council on Foreign Relations and, in the following years, numerous exchange visits with Orthodox delegations took place, a process only halted by the outbreak of war. Lang's 1939 visit to the <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople</a> is regarded as the high point of his ecumenical record. <a href="George%20Bell%20%28bishop%29">George Bell, Bishop of Chichester</a>, maintained that no one in the Anglican Communion did more than Lang to promote the unity movement.

When king <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> wanted to marry <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>, a divorced woman, in 1936, the archbishop led the opposition, insisting that Edward must abdicate. Lang was later lampooned in <a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a> for a lack of "Christian charity".

In 1937 the Oxford Conference on Church and Society, which later gave birth to the <a href="World%20Council%20of%20Churches">World Council of Churches</a>, produced what was according to the church historian Adrian Hastings "the most serious approach to the problems of society that the Church had yet managed", but without Lang's close involvement. By this time Lang's identification with the poor had largely vanished, as had his interest in social reform. In the Church Assembly his closest ally was the aristocratic <a href="Lord%20Hugh%20Cecil">Lord Hugh Cecil</a>; Hastings maintains that the Church of England in the 1930s was controlled "less by Lang and Temple in tandem than by Lang and Hugh Cecil". Lang got on well with <a href="Hewlett%20Johnson">Hewlett Johnson</a>, the pro-communist priest who was appointed <a href="Dean%20of%20Canterbury">Dean of Canterbury</a> in 1931.

Lang often spoke in the House of Lords about the treatment of Russian Christians in the Soviet Union. He also denounced the anti-semitic policies of the German government, and he took private steps to help European Jews. In 1938 he was instrumental in saving 60 rabbis from Burgenland, who would have been murdered by the Nazis had the archbishop not obtained them entry visas to England.

In 1933, having commented on the "noble task" of assisting India towards independence, he was appointed to the Joint Committee on the Indian Constitution. He condemned the Italian invasion of <a href="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</a> in 1935, appealing for medical supplies to be sent to the Abyssinian troops. As the threat of war increased later in the decade, Lang became a strong supporter of the government's policy of appeasing the European dictators, declaring the Sunday after the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> of September 1938 to be a day of thanksgivings for the "sudden lifting of this cloud". Earlier that year, contrary to his former stance, he had supported the Anglo-Italian agreement to recognise the conquest of Abyssinia, because he believed that "an increase of appeasement" was necessary to avoid the threat of war. Lang also backed the government's non-intervention policy in regard to the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, saying that there were no clear issues that required the taking of sides. He described the bombing of Guernica by the Germans, on 26 April 1937, as "deplorable and shocking". In October 1937 Lang's condemnation of <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Imperial Japanese Army actions in China</a> provoked hostile scrutiny by the Japanese authorities of the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20in%20Japan">Anglican Church in Japan</a>, and caused some in that church's leadership to publicly disassociate themselves from the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>.

On the domestic front, Lang supported campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty. He upheld the right of the Church to refuse the remarriage of divorced persons within its buildings, but he did not directly oppose <a href="A.P.%20Herbert">A.P. Herbert</a>'s Matrimonial Causes Bill of 1937, which liberalised the divorce laws – Lang believed "it was no longer possible to impose the full Christian standard by law on a largely non-Christian population." He drew criticism for his opposition to the reform of the ancient <a href="tithe">tithe</a> system, whereby many farmers paid a proportion of their income to the Church; in the subsequent "Tithe Wars", demonstrators at <a href="Ashford%2C%20Kent">Ashford, Kent</a> ceremonially burned his effigy.
Near the end of his term in office Lang led a deputation from several church groups to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Education</a>, to present a five-point plan for the teaching of religion in state schools. These points were eventually embodied in the <a href="Education%20Act%201944">1944 Education Act</a>.

Lang was responsible for drafting King George V's silver jubilee broadcast message in 1935, and the King's last two Christmas messages. This closeness to the throne was not maintained when the king died in January 1936 and was succeeded by his son, <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VIII</a>. The new king was wary of Lang, whom he had once admired. Edward now found Lang to be "rather ... accustomed to the company of princes and statesmen, more interested in the pursuit of prestige and power than the abstractions of the human soul".

Lang believed that, as Prince of Wales, Edward had not always been wise in his choice of friends and acquaintances, whose standards Lang was later to condemn as "alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people". The archbishop had been aware for some time of the King's relationship with the American <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>, then married to her second husband <a href="Ernest%20Simpson">Ernest Simpson</a>. In mid-1936 it became clear that the King intended to marry Simpson either before or shortly after his impending coronation, depending on the timing of her divorce from her husband. Lang agonised over whether he could, with good conscience, administer the Coronation Oath to the king in such circumstances, bearing in mind the Church's teaching on marriage. He confided to his diary his hopes that circumstances might change, or that he might be able to persuade the King to reconsider his actions, but the King refused to meet him. Lang kept close contact with the King's mother, <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>, the Prime Minister and the King's Private Secretary. The king believed that Lang's influence was strong, later recalling how from beginning to end he felt the archbishop's "shadowy, hovering presence" in the background.

The matter became public knowledge on 2 December 1936 when the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bradford%20%28diocese%29">Bishop of Bradford</a> made an indirect comment on the King's "need for Divine Grace". By then the king had unalterably decided that he would abdicate rather than give up Wallis Simpson. All attempts to dissuade him failed, and on 11 December he gave up his throne in favour of his brother, <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George VI</a>. Two days later Lang broadcast a speech, in which he said: "From God he received a high and sacred trust. Yet by his own will he has ... surrendered the trust." The king's motive had been "a craving for private happiness" that he had sought "in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage". The speech was widely condemned for its lack of charity towards the departed king and provoked the writer <a href="Gerald%20Bullett">Gerald Bullett</a> to publish a satirical punning rhyme:

According to the writer <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a>, Lang's broadcast "dealt a disastrous blow to religious feeling throughout the country".

Lang did not disguise his relief that the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." On 12 May 1937, Lang <a href="Coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">crowned George VI</a> with full pomp in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. "Time" magazine recorded: "All through the three-hour ceremony, the most important person there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." He also said of the Coronation: "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." "Thank God that is over!" said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" cried the archbishop. "I only wish it was beginning over again."

When the Second World War began in September 1939, Lang saw his main duty as the preservation of spiritual values during what he deemed to be an honourable conflict. He opposed strategies such as indiscriminate bombing, and on 21 December 1940, in a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" signed jointly with Temple and <a href="Arthur%20Hinsley">Cardinal Hinsley</a>, Lang expressed support for the pope's <a href="Sword%20of%20the%20Spirit">Five Peace Points initiative</a>. Lang was sympathetic to the <a href="Sword%20of%20the%20Spirit">Sword of the Spirit</a> campaign, founded by <a href="Arthur%20Hinsley">Cardinal Hinsley</a> in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a>, Lang's London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.

After Germany's attack on Russia in June 1941, Lang said that the Russians must now be regarded as allies, without forgetting or condoning the excesses of the past. His relations with <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, prime minister since May 1940, were difficult because "he [Churchill] knows nothing about the Church, its life, its needs or its personnel". There was therefore "uncertainty as to what motives or how much knowledge may determine his decisions [on Church matters]".

During 1941 Lang considered retirement. His main concern was that a <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> – "perhaps the most fateful Lambeth Conference ever held" – would need to be called soon after the war. Lang felt that he would be too old to lead it and that he should make way for a younger man, preferably William Temple. On 27 November he informed the prime minister, Winston Churchill, of his decision to retire on 31 March 1942. His last official act in office, on 28 March, was the <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a> of Princess Elizabeth.

On his retirement Lang was raised to the <a href="peerage%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">peerage</a> as Baron Lang of Lambeth, of Lambeth in the County of Surrey. He thus remained in the House of Lords, where he attended regularly and contributed to debates. He worried about money, despite a pension, a large <a href="grace%20and%20favour">grace and favour</a> house at <a href="Kew">Kew</a>, and some generous cash gifts from well-wishers. In 1943 he spoke in the House of Lords in support of the <a href="Beveridge%20Report">Beveridge Report</a> on social insurance, and on 9 February 1944 he reiterated his earlier opposition to obliteration bombing. In October 1944 Lang was greatly distressed by the sudden death of William Temple, his successor at Canterbury, writing: "I don't like to think of the loss to the Church and Nation... But 'God knows and God reigns'."
On 5 December 1945 Lang was due to speak in a Lords debate on conditions in Central Europe. On his way to <a href="Kew%20Gardens%20station%20%28London%29">Kew Gardens station</a> to catch the London train, he collapsed and was taken to hospital, but was found to be dead on arrival. A post-mortem attributed the death to heart failure. In paying tribute the following day, <a href="Christopher%20Addison%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Addison">Lord Addison</a> said that Lang was "not only a great cleric but a great man... we have lost in him a Father in God." His body was cremated and the ashes taken to the Chapel of St Stephen Martyr, a side chapel at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>.

The <a href="probate">probate</a> value of Lang's estate was £29 541 (approximately £ in 2019).

Although Lang was a bishop in England for longer than anyone else in the twentieth century, Hastings says that "of no other is it so hard to address his true significance". Biographer George Moyser says:

According to biographer Lockhart he was a complex character in whom "a jangle of warring personalities... never reached agreement among themselves." Lockhart writes that while Lang's many years of high office saw progress in the cause of Christian reunion, the mark he left on the Church was relatively small; many believed it could have been larger and deeper. While Lang's oratorical and administrative gifts were beyond doubt, Hastings nevertheless claims that as Archbishop of Canterbury, Lang displayed no effective leadership or guidance, turning away from reform and content to be the "final sentinel to the "ancien régime"". Wilkinson says that Lang dealt conscientiously with problems as they arose, but without any overall strategy.

In Hastings's view, Lang was probably more sympathetic to Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a <a href="cassock">cassock</a> as everyday dress and to wear a <a href="mitre">mitre</a> on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> to do so. Lang believed that in relation to the supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.

Despite Lang's long involvement with the poorest of society, after becoming Archbishop of York he increasingly detached himself from everyday life. The historian Tom Buchanan wrote that Lang's sympathy with ordinary people was replaced by "an upper class affectation and a delight in the high society in which his office allowed him to move". No archbishop has been as close as Lang to the Royal Family; a <a href="Channel%20Four">Channel Four</a> television history of the British monarchy maintained that Lang "held a view of Christianity in which the monarchy, rather than the cross, stood centre stage as the symbol of the nation's faith". Successive generations of the Royal Family considered him their friend and honoured him. King George V appointed him to the largely ceremonial post of <a href="Lord%20High%20Almoner">Lord High Almoner</a>, and after the 1937 Coronation George VI created him a <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (GCVO), a rare honour which, like the Royal Victorian Chain, lay in the private gift of the Sovereign. A friend, commenting on the transformation of Lang's perspective, said of him: "He might have been <a href="Thomas%20Wolsey">Cardinal Wolsey</a> or St Francis of Assisi, and he chose to be Cardinal Wolsey."

Lang also received numerous <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary doctorates</a> from British universities. His portrait was painted many times; after sitting for Sir <a href="William%20Orpen">William Orpen</a> in 1924, Lang reportedly remarked to Bishop Hensley Henson of Durham that the portrait showed him as "proud, prelatical and pompous". Henson's recorded reply was "To which of these epithets does Your Grace take exception?"

At an early stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no objection to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. However, in Robert Beaken's book, <a href="Cosmo%20Lang.%20Archbishop%20in%20War%20and%20Crisis">Cosmo Lang. Archbishop in War and Crisis</a>, space is given over to a discussion of Lang's sexuality. Beaken is largely successful in showing that Lang was probably not a repressed homosexual, but a lonely figure who found it difficult to form close personal relationships of any kind. In fact he did refuse to change the law in the Church of England regarding Homosexual Scandals in 1938 and was a known conservative regarding divorce and remarriage of divorcees. He also had close friendships with colleagues such as Dick Sheppard, and with <a href="Wilfrid%20Parker">Wilfrid Parker</a>, his one-time <a href="domestic%20chaplain">domestic chaplain</a> to whom he wrote admitting his personal loneliness, and of his need for "someone in daily nearness to love". He enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after a visit to the <a href="Rowntree%27s">Rowntree's</a> chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had "stirred up all the instincts of my youth... very little subdued by the passage of years".

George Bell, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> who had earlier praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure to take a lead after the Prayer Book rejection of 1928 meant that the Church of England had been unable to revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's "laissez-faire" approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had failed to live up to his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.

Lang wrote several books, including a novel of the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201745">Jacobite rising of 1745</a>. This had its origins in stories told by Lang to the Magdalen College choirboys during his tenure as Magdalen's Dean of Divinity.

Geology of the Lassen volcanic area

The geology of the Lassen volcanic area presents a record of sedimentation and volcanic activity in the area in and around <a href="Lassen%20Volcanic%20National%20Park">Lassen Volcanic National Park</a> in <a href="Northern%20California">Northern California</a>, U.S. The park is located in the southernmost part of the <a href="Cascade%20Mountains">Cascade Mountain Range</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of the United States. Pacific Oceanic <a href="plate%20tectonics">tectonic plates</a> have plunged below the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> in this part of North America for hundreds of millions of years. Heat from these <a href="Subduction">subducting</a> plates has fed scores of <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> over at least the past 30 million years (see <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest">Geology of the Pacific Northwest</a>) and is also responsible for activities in the Lassen volcanic area.

Between 3 and 4 million years ago, volcanic-derived mud flows called <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s streamed down several major mountains that included nearby but now extinct Mount Yana and Mount Maidu to become the Tuscan Formation. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>ic and later <a href="andesite">andesitic</a> to <a href="dacite">dacitic</a> flows of <a href="lava">lava</a> covered increasingly larger areas of this formation to eventually form the <a href="volcanic%20plateau">lava plateau</a> that the park sits on. About 600,000 years ago, <a href="Mount%20Tehama">Mount Tehama</a> started to rise as a <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> in the southwestern corner of the park, eventually reaching an estimated in height. Following a series of eruptions approximately 350,000 years ago, its cone collapsed into itself to form a wide <a href="caldera">caldera</a>.

Roughly 27,000 years ago, a dacite <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a> quickly pushed its way through Tehama's destroyed north-eastern flank, becoming the approximately shorter <a href="Lassen%20Peak">Lassen Peak</a>. Lassen's shape was significantly altered by <a href="glacial%20erosion">glacial erosion</a> from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a>. Since then, smaller dacite domes such as the 1,100-year-old <a href="Chaos%20Crags">Chaos Crags</a> have formed around Lassen. <a href="Phreatic">Phreatic</a> (steam explosion) eruptions, dacite and andesite lava flows along with <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a> formation have persisted into modern times. Most notable of these is the mid to late 17th century eruption and formation (Tree Ring dates) of <a href="Cinder%20Cone%20and%20the%20Fantastic%20Lava%20Beds">Cinder Cone</a> and the early 20th century eruption of Lassen Peak. The only activity since then has been the constant bubbling of <a href="mud%20pot">mud pot</a>s and steaming of <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s from the various <a href="geothermal%20areas%20in%20Lassen%20Volcanic%20National%20Park">geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park</a>. However, a potential exists for renewed vigorous volcanic activity that could threaten life and property in the area.

The Lassen volcanic area lies at the southern extremity of the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, which extends northward some from <a href="Lassen%20Peak">Lassen Peak</a> within the park through <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and into <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Lassen Peak and the 16 other major <a href="Cascade%20Volcanoes">Cascade Volcanoes</a> form a segment of a ring of volcanoes that circle the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> known collectively as the '<a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>.' The Cascade Volcanoes are fed by heat generated as the <a href="Gorda%20Plate">Gorda</a> and <a href="Juan%20de%20Fuca%20Plate">Juan de Fuca</a> tectonic plates are being <a href="subduction">subducted</a> below the much larger but lighter <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>. Lying some offshore, the <a href="divergent%20plate%20boundary">spreading center</a> of the Gorda Plate pushes out about of new crust toward the coast of Northernmost California and southern <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> every year.

The composition of the molten rock (magma) that feeds volcanism in the Lassen volcanic area ranges widely in its content of <a href="silica">silica</a> or ; the higher the silica content, the greater the ability of the magma to trap and hold on to gas and water vapor. When high-silica (<a href="dacite">dacitic</a>) magma rises to the Earth's surface, the trapped gases and vapors can erupt explosively to produce ash clouds and <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s that consist of superheated gas, ash and volcanic fragments. Dacite magma that is extruded nonexplosively as lava forms <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s because it is too viscous (sticky) to flow far away from its source. Low-silica (<a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic) magma is more fluid and usually erupts as lava in less explosive eruptions than dacite because gas and water vapor escape easily from it. Eruptions of basalt magma typically produce elongate lava flows, as well as build <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s (piles of small frothy lava fragments or 'cinders') around volcanic vents.

Basaltic volcanism in the Lassen volcanic area occurs mainly along chains of vents aligned in a north or northwest direction, parallel to regional faults. Examples include Poison Buttes, Subglacial Buttes, Tumble Buttes, the Prospect Peak-Red Cinder area, the east side of the Hat Creek Valley and Potato Buttes-Sugarloaf area, and the Red Lake Mountain area. Prolonged basaltic volcanism at a single site can produce a sizeable edifice, like the broad, relatively flat <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es of Prospect Peak and
Sifford Mountain.

Northwest of the park lies the <a href="Klamath%20Mountains">Klamath Mountains</a> (a collective term for the <a href="Siskiyou%20Mountains">Siskiyou</a>, <a href="Trinity%20Mountains">Trinity</a>, <a href="Salmon%20Mountains">Salmon</a> and <a href="Marble%20Mountains%20%28Siskiyou%20County%29">Marble</a> mountain ranges). To the west lies the <a href="Sacramento%20Valley">Sacramento Valley</a>. Just south of the park begins the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, and to the east lie the <a href="Modoc%20Plateau">Modoc Plateau</a> and then the <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a>.

All rock now exposed in the area of the park is <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic</a>, but this has not always been the case. For hundreds of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form <a href="mountain">mountain</a>s, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="mud">mud</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.

About 70 million years ago, the area where the Cascade Range is now situated was under the most recent encroachment by the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="NPS-Lassen-Volcanoes/Lava Flows"></ref> The rocks that make up the modern Sierra Nevada and the <a href="Klamath%20Mountains">Klamath Mountains</a> were already in existence but deeply buried. Some 70 million years before (140 million years before present), the rocks that now make up the Klamaths broke away from the rocks that now make up the Sierras and moved west, leaving the flooded 'Lassen Strait.' This broad depression was a <a href="sound%20%28geography%29">seaway</a> that connected the marine basin in <a href="California">California</a> with that in east central Oregon.

The entire western portion of North America was being deformed from the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a> starting around 70 million years ago. Gradually during millions of years, crustal rocks were folded and fractured and the seas driven away. This same bending and breaking of rocks relieved pressure on the hot material beneath the Earth's crust and permitted <a href="magma">magma</a> to rise toward the surface. Volcanoes burst into activity starting 30 million years ago from Washington southward along the Cascades and in the area now occupied by the Sierra Nevada. This activity continued until approximately 11 or 12 million years ago. Lava and ash reached a thickness of up to in some areas, forming what is now known as the western Cascades. These have been eroded until they are now rolling hills.

Meanwhile, toward the end of this activity, eruptions of a different kind took place on an unprecedented scale in eastern Oregon and Washington. From innumerable cracks, floods of highly fluid basaltic lava spread to cover an area of over . Now known as the <a href="Columbia%20Plateau">Columbia Plateau</a>, this great lava bed of <a href="flood%20basalt">flood basalt</a> covers much of Oregon, Washington and even parts of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. Northern California's <a href="Modoc%20Plateau">Modoc Plateau</a> is a thinner basaltic flow which some geologists associate with the Columbia Plateau, but there are technical objections to this. The <a href="High%20Cascades">High Cascades</a> took shape as a distinct mountain belt as a result of this upheaval and the bending of the thick blanket of volcanic rocks. During the next 10 million years, a series of new basaltic volcanic cones similar to the <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es now found in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> were built.

Between two and three million years ago, during the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> was uplifted and tilted westward. A series of volcanic mudflows (<a href="lahar">lahar</a>s) from three major source areas contributed debris that covered almost to form the oldest distinctive <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> in the High Cascades. The resulting <a href="Tuscan%20Formation">Tuscan Formation</a> is not exposed anywhere in the national park but it is just below the surface in many places within it. The oldest pyroclastic material in the formation is 3 or 4 million years old. The youngest part of the formation consists of interbedded <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a> and volcanic <a href="breccia">breccia</a>s that are 2 million years old.

One major source of the formation was Mount Yana; centered a few miles (5 km) southwest of Butt Mountain and south of the park. Mount Yana had probably reached its full size of in elevation and in diameter before Mount Maidu, the second source, had acquired half its growth. Mount Maidu, which eventually surpassed Mount Yana in size, was centered over what is now the town of <a href="Mineral%2C%20California">Mineral, California</a> but has been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years (the grassy plain around the town is Maidu's <a href="caldera">caldera</a>). A third source situated north of Latour Butte made a lesser contribution to the formation. Minor sources included an area near Hatchet Mountain Pass (northwest of <a href="Burney%20Mountain">Burney Mountain</a>), <a href="dike%20%28geology%29">dikes</a> south and southwest of Inskip Hill and possibly Campbell Mound (north of <a href="Chico%2C%20California">Chico, California</a>).

Meanwhile, within the park boundary other volcanic events were taking place. Basaltic lavas poured forth in the vicinity of Willow Lake in the southwestern portion of the park. These were followed by a very thick sequence of very fluid <a href="andesite">andesitic</a> lavas which erupted near Juniper Lake and flowed westward about four miles (6 km). At about the same time, other andesitic lavas poured from several vents on the central <a href="plateau">plateau</a> to cover an area of at least . Included among these flows were the Twin Lake lavas of black porphyritic andesite, which are notable in that they contain <a href="xenocryst">xenocryst</a>s of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. The Flatiron andesites spread over the southwestern part of the park area around this time. Apparently, the vents of these lavas renewed activity at a much later date to form three <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s: Hat Mountain, Crater Butte and Fairfield Peak.

Somewhat later, andesitic lavas poured out from what is now Reading Peak and mainly flowed to the south and east, reaching the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.

From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large conical <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> called <a href="Mount%20Tehama">Mount Tehama</a> (also called Brokeoff Volcano) in what is now the southwest corner of the park. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and <a href="tephra">tephra</a> (<a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a>, <a href="breccia">breccia</a>, and <a href="pumice">pumice</a>) with increasing amounts of <a href="tephra">tephra</a> with elevation.

Tehama eventually reached an elevation of about , was wide at its base, and contained of material. Its principal vent lay in the neighborhood of what is now <a href="Sulphur%20Works">Sulphur Works</a>, but a second vent from which no lavas issued lay on the eastern flank of <a href="Little%20Hot%20Springs%20Valley">Little Hot Springs Valley</a>. Contrary to popular belief, <a href="Bumpass%20Hell">Bumpass Hell</a> is not one of Tehama's main vents since it is located outside of the <a href="caldera">caldera</a>.
It is possible that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for this possible collapse may have been the release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.

Four <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es (Raker and Prospect Peaks, Sifford Mountain and Mount Harkness) grew to elevations of between at the corners of the central plateau. Raker Peak erupted andesite lavas while basalt flowed from the others. Each of these volcanoes developed a cinder cone on its summit during their last stages of <a href="volcanic%20eruption">eruption</a>. Later, a mass of <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> was forced through the north flank of Sifford Mountain and a plug of <a href="dacite">dacite</a> was pushed up through the west flank of Raker Peak.

In the past 50,000 years, at least seven major episodes of dacitic volcanism produced <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s and pyroclastic deposits in the Lassen volcanic area, and another five episodes produced basaltic and <a href="andesite">andesitic</a> (<a href="silica">silica</a> content between basalt and dacite) lava flows. Eruptions have occurred at sites including Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat (explosive dacite eruptions followed by dome growth) and Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak (basalt eruptions). In addition, about 30 smaller volcanoes erupted basaltic lavas in the larger region surrounding the Lassen volcanic center.

<a href="Radiometric%20dating">Radiometric dating</a> indicates that around 31,000 years ago a new vent opened up on the northeastern slope of Tehama, probably close to where <a href="Lassen%20Peak">Lassen Peak</a> now stands. Streams of fluid dacite flowed chiefly toward the north, reaching a thickness of and covering perhaps . Known as the Loomis Sequence, these pre-Lassen dacites are the black, glassy, columnar lavas that now encircle Lassen Peak.

Sometime between 25,000 and 31,000 years ago, Lassen Peak, a Pelean lava dome volcano, was pushed up through the pre-Lassen dacites. Lassen grew past the normal maximum size of plug dome volcanoes, , and reached a height of above the surrounding plateau in as little as a few years. The surface of the growing pile of about a of lava crumbled continually, forming enormous banks of <a href="Scree">talus</a>. When Lassen Peak formed it looked much like the nearby <a href="Chaos%20Crags">Chaos Crags</a> domes do today, with steep sides covered by angular rock talus. Lassen Peak's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a>. At least one of Lassen's glaciers extended as far as from the volcano itself.

Later, but not precisely dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which at first glance appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily <a href="glacial%20erosion">glaciated</a> and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000 years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.

<a href="Glaciation">Glaciation</a> has played an important but incompletely understood role in the park. <a href="Glacier">Glacier</a>s existed throughout the park area during most of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.

Reading Peak formed a second center from which ice moved north into Hat Creek and Summit Creek. Ice moving southward united with some of the above glaciers and emptied into Warner Valley. On the central plateau, the ridge connecting Hat Mountain with Crater Butte served as a divide between ice flowing northward to Badger Flat and Hat Creek and that moving southward to Corral Meadows, Kings Creek and Warner Valley. Ice from Mt. Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley.

The crest of Saddle Mountain served as a divide with ice north of it moving into the depression containing Snag and Butte Lakes, while those to the south entered Warner Valley. The ice varied from a thickness of in Warner Valley to much thinner sheets in the higher mountains.

Subsequent to the rise of Lassen Peak, several dacitic <a href="pumice">pumice</a> cones developed in a rift extending northwest from the base of Lassen Peak. Then about 1,100 years ago several dacitic domes, the Chaos Crags, protruded through these cones and obliterated all but half of the southernmost cone. At least 300 years ago a series of large avalanches, possibly triggered by <a href="phreatic%20eruption">steam explosions</a>, occurred on the north side of the Crags. These avalanches created their own 'air cushions' that helped accelerate them to speeds exceeding and push them partway up Table Mountain. The resulting wilderness of debris, the Chaos Jumbles, covers an area of . Manzanita Lake was formed as a result of Manzanita Creek being dammed by the debris. Steam rose from the domes of Chaos Crags until 1857.
Around the mid-18th century a series of eruptions produced <a href="Cinder%20Cone%20and%20the%20Fantastic%20Lava%20Beds">Cinder Cone</a> in the northeast corner of the park, mantling an area of with ejecta in the process. Ash falling on the streams of lava pouring from the cone's east flank formed the Painted Dunes. A flow of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>-studded basalt lava (the Fantastic Lava Beds) poured from the Cinder Cone and dammed the streams that fed nearby Butte Lake to the north, forming Snag Lake to the south. In the late 18th century Cinder Cone had its most recent eruption and lava flow.

Explosions recurred at irregular intervals on Lassen Peak for most of 1914. Later, on May 19, 1915, a mass of lava rose in the summit crater and spilled down the western side of the volcano. Extensive lahars (mudflows) were created on the northeastern side as snowbanks were melted. The resulting debris swept down the slope. Divided by Raker Peak, part of this mudflow raced down Lost Creek; the remaining flow passed over the rise east of the park road and rushed down Hat Creek. A wide barren swath was torn through the forest.

A great explosion blasted out a new crater three days later on May 22, 1915. A volcanic cloud rose , but a portion of the explosive force was deflected downward. The resulting <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a> of super-heated gas, rocks and ash roared down the same path taken by the mudflow, resulting in further damage along the headwaters of Hat and Lost Creeks. Ash from the eruption blew eastward with some fine ash falling at least as far as from the volcano.

The last major eruptions of Lassen Peak occurred in April through June 1917, when a new crater was created at the summit of the mountain. Less explosive activity continued through 1921. Some authorities, such as the <a href="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a>, consider the eruption of Mount Lassen to have ended on June 29, 1917.

Since then, the volcano has been dormant, although some steam still rises from small vents in its summit and on its flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>).

The most common volcanic activity over the last 50,000 years in the Lassen volcanic area consists of small to moderate-sized eruptions that produce basaltic lava flows and localized ash falls. These eruptions typically last a few months to a year, but may continue for several years. They can cover more than with lava flows, build cinder cones as high as , and blanket many square miles or square kilometers with ash a few inches (several cm) to about three feet (one meter) deep. Because these eruptions are relatively nonviolent, they rarely cause <a href="human">human</a> fatalities.
Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area typically begin with steam explosions caused by the interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8 km) of the vent with a thick layer of <a href="pumice">pumice</a>, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>, particularly those with <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>s.

The areas of highest hazard are those that could be affected by <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s and <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (see map). These areas, including Hat Creek Valley, are those in the immediate vicinity and downhill from likely eruption sites. Fallout of ash will affect areas downwind at the time of an eruption. Within the hazard zones, relative hazard is gradational, decreasing away from the location of potential vents.

After an initial explosive eruption, extrusion of <a href="gas">gas</a>-depleted <a href="dacite">dacite</a> magma commonly forms <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such a sequence of events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000 years ago.

Interaction of hot pyroclastic flows with <a href="snow">snow</a> and <a href="ice">ice</a> can generate highly mobile flows of mud and debris (called <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s) that may rush down valleys leading away from a volcano. Because of this, active volcanoes that have a significant snow and ice cover can be particularly dangerous. The lahars that threatened residents of the Lassen area in May 1915 were generated by relatively small eruptions of Lassen Peak. Nonetheless, they traveled down creek beds as far as and released floods that affected valleys for downstream.

Additional volcano hazards at Lassen are <a href="rockfall">rockfall</a>s and <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s not directly related to eruptions. Recently erupted volcanic domes are unstable and can collapse, generating small to large rockfalls. Approximately 350 years ago, collapse of one of the Chaos Crags domes generated huge rockfalls, creating an area now called the Chaos Jumbles. The first and largest of these traveled downslope and was able to climb up the side of Table Mountain. The trigger for the rockfall is unknown, but it was most likely a large <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>. Normal weathering also weakens fractured volcanic rock and contributes to small rockfalls. In the summer of 1994, a rockfall of occurred on the northeastern flank of Lassen Peak. During periods of extreme <a href="rain">rain</a>fall or snow melt, mudflows are sometimes generated by mobilization of loose volcanic debris and soil on the slopes of volcanoes.

The only current visible activity in the Lassen volcanic area is from the various <a href="geothermal%20areas%20in%20Lassen%20Volcanic%20National%20Park">geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park</a>; boiling <a href="hot%20springs">hot springs</a>, bubbling <a href="mud%20pot">mud pot</a>s and fuming <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s. Most of these features lie in or are closely adjacent to <a href="Mount%20Tehama">Mount Tehama</a>'s caldera. In each thermal area, the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole at Bumpass Hell and on the northwest flanks of Lassen Peak.

The hottest and most vigorous hydrothermal features in the Lassen volcanic area are at Bumpass Hell, which marks the principal area of upflow and steam discharge from the Lassen hydrothermal system. A prominent steam plume marks the site of Big Boiler, the largest fumarole (steam and volcanic-gas vent) in the park. The temperature of the high-velocity steam jetting from it has been measured as high as . A thin crust of material often covers these boiling hot features, making them a serious burn hazard to anyone walking off trail. The steam-heated waters of the features are typically <a href="acid">acid</a>ic and, even if cool enough, are not safe for bathing.

Flag of Singapore

The national flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> became self-governing within the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. It was reconfirmed as the <a href="national%20flag">national flag</a> when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, it was the only state flag in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> not to have a 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, <a href="charge%20%28heraldry%29">overlaid</a> in the <a href="flag%20terminology">canton</a> (upper-left quadrant) by a white <a href="crescent">crescent</a> moon facing a <a href="pentagon">pentagon</a> of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.

Vessels at sea do not use the national flag as an <a href="ensign">ensign</a>. <a href="Merchant%20vessel">Merchant vessel</a>s and <a href="pleasure%20craft">pleasure craft</a> fly a <a href="civil%20ensign">civil ensign</a> of red charged in white with a variant of the crescent and stars emblem in the centre. Non-military government vessels such as <a href="coast%20guard">coast guard</a> ships fly a <a href="state%20ensign">state ensign</a> of blue with the national flag in the canton, charged with an eight-pointed red and white <a href="compass%20rose">compass rose</a> in the lower <a href="flag%20terminology">fly</a>. <a href="Republic%20of%20Singapore%20Navy">Naval</a> warships fly a <a href="naval%20ensign">naval ensign</a> similar to the state ensign, but in white with a red compass rose emblem.

Rules defined by the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act govern the use and display of the national flag. These have been relaxed to allow citizens to fly the flag from vehicles during national holidays and from homes at any time of the year.

Singapore was under British rule in the 19th century, having been amalgamated into the <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a> together with <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a> and <a href="Penang">Penang</a>. The flag that was used to represent the Settlements was a British <a href="Blue%20Ensign">Blue Ensign</a> containing three gold crowns—one for each settlement—separated by a red inverted <a href="pall%20%28heraldry%29">pall</a>, which resembles an inverted Y.

The Settlement of Singapore had no separate flag, although the city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in 1911. During the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Singapore">occupation of Singapore</a> by the Japanese during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the Japanese <a href="Flag%20of%20Japan">national flag</a> was used on land by the military and during public events. Soon after the Second World War, Singapore became an independent <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a> and adopted its own flag. It was modified from the Straits Settlements flag to reduce the number of crowns from three to one.

Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire on 3 June 1959. Six months later, upon the installation of the new "<a href="Yang%20di-Pertuan%20Negara">Yang di-Pertuan Negara</a>" (head of state) on 3 December 1959, the national flag was officially adopted, along with the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Singapore">state coat of arms</a> and the national anthem "<a href="Majulah%20Singapura">Majulah Singapura</a>" ("Onward Singapore"). Then-<a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Singapore">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="Toh%20Chin%20Chye">Toh Chin Chye</a> discussed the creation of the national flag in a 1989 interview:

The design of the flag was completed in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Singapore">Cabinet</a> decided against this, as red was regarded as a rallying point for <a href="communism">communism</a>. According to an account given by <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modeled off the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">flag of the People's Republic of China</a> and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.

On 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. When presenting the motion to the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Singapore">Legislative Assembly of Singapore</a> on 11 November 1959, <a href="S.%20Rajaratnam">Sinnathamby Rajaratnam</a>, the Minister for Culture, stated: "National flags, crest and anthem express symbolically the hopes and ideals of a people... The possession of a national flag and crest is, for a people, symbolic of self-respect."

In September 1962, the people of Singapore <a href="Singaporean%20national%20referendum%2C%201962">voted to join the Federation of Malaysia</a>. The process was completed on 16 September 1963, when the <a href="Flag%20of%20Malaysia">Malaysian flag</a> was hoisted on Singapore by Prime Minister <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>. The Singapore flag was reconfirmed as the national flag when Singapore became fully independent from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.

The Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules define the flag's composition and the symbolism of its elements: red symbolises "universal brotherhood and equality of man", and white, "pervading and everlasting purity and virtue". The <a href="Lunar%20phase">waxing</a> <a href="crescent">crescent</a> moon "represents a young nation on the ascendant". The five stars "stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality". During the second half of the 20th century, the <a href="star%20and%20crescent">star and crescent</a> symbol came to be recognized as a symbol of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, and Singapore's flag came to be seen in this context by the nation's Muslim activists. Singapore and <a href="Flag%20of%20Nepal">Nepal</a> are the only non-Muslim nations to have a crescent moon in their national flags, and along with <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the only two countries partially or completely located in <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> to feature the <a href="Southern%20Cross">Southern Cross</a> on its flag.

The ratio of the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the manufacturing of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is <a href="Pantone">Pantone</a> 032. According to guidelines published by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%2C%20Communications%20and%20the%20Arts">Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts</a> (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, but it must be in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes , and . The material that is recommended for the national flag is <a href="Bunting%20%28textile%29">bunting wool</a>.

Until 2004, the flag was used exclusively on or in front of buildings owned by the government, ministries, statutory boards and educational institutions on a year-round basis. The flag could only be flown by individuals and non-governmental organisations during the month of August to mark the country's national day on 9 August. During the National Day celebrations period (1 July – 30 September), rules governing the flying of the national flag outside buildings are relaxed. The flag may be displayed on any vehicle (other than a hearse), vessel or aircraft, and may be incorporated as part of any costume or attire, so long as this is done in a respectful manner.

These restrictions on individuals and non-governmental organisations were relaxed in 2004 to allow the flag to be flown year-round under certain conditions. A statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts (now <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%2C%20Communications%20and%20the%20Arts%20%28Singapore%29">MICA, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts</a>) said that "[t]he national flag, national anthem and Singapore lion head... are our most visible symbols of our sovereignty, pride and honour" and urged Singaporeans to use those "rallying" symbols to "identify with the nation".

No rationale was provided for the changes, although <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> correspondents noted that the government had recently been trying to rally patriotic sentiment dampened by economic issues. (In 2003, unemployment in Singapore reached a 17-year-high of 5.9%, and the <a href="severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome">severe acute respiratory syndrome</a> (SARS) epidemic in East Asia seriously affected the island's tourist trade, causing <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> to suffer a financial loss for the first time in its history.)

Following requests by Singaporeans, guidelines for the use of the flag were further broadened in 2006 to give residents a variety of opportunities to express their loyalty to Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the <a href="Singapore%20National%20Day%20Parade">National Day Parade</a>. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.

Singaporean citizens, government and non-governmental organisations may display or fly the national flag throughout the year to identify themselves with the nation, and especially encouraged to do so during occasions of national celebration or national significance. Non-Singaporean businesses and organisations are also allowed to display the flag throughout the year. The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules made under the "Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act". It is an offence to knowingly contravene specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty is a fine not exceeding <a href="Singapore%20dollar">S$</a>1,000.

The Singaporean government dictates that no person may treat the national flag with disrespect, such as allowing the flag to touch the ground. The flag must not be displayed below any other flag, emblem or object; dipped in salute to any person or thing; or displayed or carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.

Within Singapore, the national flag takes precedence over all other flags, subject to <a href="Flag%20protocol">international practice</a>. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must be in a position of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, to the left of the other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the <a href="Standard-bearer">standard bearers</a> if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.

When the flag is displayed on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations and be behind and above any person speaking from the platform or stage. If it is displayed from a staff standing on the platform or stage, it must be on the right side of the person speaking from the platform or stage. Finally, when the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.
When the flag is displayed outside a building, it shall be displayed on or in front of the building only from a flagpole. If the flag is flown at night, it should be properly illuminated. The flag must not be displayed on any motor vehicle except on one in which the <a href="President%20of%20Singapore">President of Singapore</a> or any Government minister is travelling on official business. The flag may not be displayed on any private vessel or aircraft.

No person may use or apply the flag or any image of it for any commercial purposes or as part of any furnishing, decoration, covering or receptacle, except in such circumstances as may be approved (by MICA) in which there is no disrespect for the flag. Further, it is not permitted to use the flag as part of any trademark, or to produce or display any flag which bears any graphics or word superimposed on the design of the national flag. The flag or any image of it may also not be used or applied as or as part of any costume or attire.

The Government may ask for the flag to be lowered to <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a> in the event of the death of an important person or for <a href="national%20mourning">national mourning</a>. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any worn out or damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed of and not left visible in dustbins.

Singaporeans are encouraged to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the <a href="People%27s%20Action%20Party">People's Action Party</a>, the ruling party in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Singapore">Parliament</a>, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, without the need for the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.

On National Day in 2007 at the <a href="Padang%2C%20Singapore">Padang</a>, 8,667 volunteers holding up red and white umbrellas formed the largest-ever representation of Singapore's flag at an event organised by Young NTUC, a youth movement associated with the <a href="National%20Trades%20Union%20Congress">National Trades Union Congress</a>.

Outside the National Day celebrations period, the national flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions. A picture of the flag is commonly found in each classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at the beginning of the school day at which the national flag is raised , the <a href="Majulah%20Singapura">national anthem</a> is sung and the <a href="Singapore%20National%20Pledge">national pledge</a> is taken.

The national flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, although this is considered incorrect, as such vessels are required to hoist proper <a href="national%20colours">national colours</a> either when entering or leaving port. The <a href="ensign">ensign</a> is red and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a circle, all in white. The national flag is not used by <a href="coast%20guard">coast guard</a> ships and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns.

The Singapore Government makes announcements regarding the lowering of the flag to half-mast in the event of a death of an important personage or mourning affecting the nation. The flag has been flown at half-mast during the funerals of former <a href="President%20of%20Singapore">presidents</a> and senior politicians, and on 9 January 2005 as a mark of respect for those who perished in the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Asian tsunami disaster</a>.

Singaporean composer Lim Su Chong composed a song in 1969 entitled "Five Stars Arising" which took the elements of the national flag as its theme. The lyrics of the song speak of a new moon, five stars and a new flag "arising out of the stormy sea". The moon is "[y]outhful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil as can be", each of the stars is "a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to see" and the flag is "[c]rimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure and free". The song is often sung during National Day celebrations.

In January 2003, Singaporean artist Justin Lee Chee Kong was prevented by the <a href="Media%20Development%20Authority">Media Development Authority</a> (MDA) from exhibiting a painting entitled "Double Happiness— A Fantasy in Red", which consisted of an image of the Singapore flag with various red images of the <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese character</a>s for <a href="Double%20Happiness%20%28calligraphy%29">double happiness</a>. The move was made on the grounds that "the National Flag is a national symbol and no words or graphics should be superimposed on it".

Lee reported that the work was simply a display of one's love for their country and an expression of joy at Singapore's success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be "treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon". When interviewed by "<a href="The%20New%20Paper">The New Paper</a>", he said "I know as a citizen that we are not allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist." He also complained about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a national flag made of hair at the <a href="Esplanade%20-%20Theatres%20on%20the%20Bay">Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay</a>. Lee felt the use of hair to create the nation's flag meant that the flag was in the wrong colours, and was distasteful.

Also in 2003, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> performed in Singapore as part of their 2002/2003 <a href="Licks%20World%20Tour">Licks World Tour</a>. At the first performance, there were two <a href="inflatable%20doll">inflatable doll</a>s on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.

In August 2007, a Singaporean pub, Loof, sent an electronic direct mailer (e-flyer) to at least 1,500 members on its mailing list featuring a close-up shot of the crotch of a female model wearing a red swimsuit or pair of underpants bearing the crescent and five stars of the national flag. This was done as part of the pub's publicity campaign for its National Day events. According to Loof's marketing manager, "[T]he ad was definitely not meant as an insult to the country or anyone. I hope that the ad will be taken in the spirit of humour and fun."

A majority of people polled by "The New Paper" felt the advertisement was disrespectful and in bad taste. MICA said that the advertisement did not breach the law as it only reproduced some components of the flag—it did not, for example, incorporate the flag's red and white background together. However, K.U. Menon, director of MICA's National Resilience Division, said: "MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the national flag with disrespect. [...] Symbols should be treated with some measure of dignity and we hope Loof will withdraw the ad on its own initiative."

In November 2010, during the Asian Games held in China, the Singaporean men's water polo team's swim trunks came under controversy for inappropriately displaying elements of the Singaporean Flag. Critics deemed the garment insulting and an embarrassment to the country, with the crescent moon positioned in the centre of the brief, directly over the crotch area. The garment had been designed by the team itself but had not received prior approval from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. However, even after the controversy came to light, the team was still able to continue wearing it as competition rules did not permit changing a team's uniform midway through the Games. The team was apologetic over the blunder and promised to tweak the design after that competition.

In addition to the national flag and ensigns, there are other flags used for official purposes.

Referendum Party

The Referendum Party was a <a href="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptic</a>, <a href="single%20issue%20party">single-issue</a> political party that was active in the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> to be held on the nature of the UK's membership of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the British electorate wanted to either be part of a <a href="United%20States%20of%20Europe">federal European state</a> or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a European free-trade bloc without wider political functions.

The party was founded by the Anglo-French multi-millionaire businessman and politician <a href="James%20Goldsmith">James Goldsmith</a> in November 1994. A Eurosceptic who had previously had close links to the UK's governing <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, he was also an elected <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a> for the <a href="Movement%20for%20France">Movement for France</a> party. He used his financial resources and contacts to promote the new venture, in which he was assisted by other former Conservatives. The party's structure was centralised and hierarchical, giving Goldsmith near total control over its operations. Although not offering party membership, it claimed to have 160,000 registered "supporters", an exaggerated number. In 1997, the party gained a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for two weeks when <a href="George%20Gardiner%20%28politician%29">George Gardiner</a>, the MP for <a href="Reigate%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Reigate</a>, defected to it from the Conservatives shortly before that year's general election.

In the build-up to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a>, the Referendum Party spent more on press advertising than either the incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. It stood candidates in 547 of the 659 constituencies, more than any <a href="minor%20party">minor party</a> had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>. Following the election, <a href="Psephology">psephologists</a> argued that the impact of the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its supporters reformed as a Eurosceptic <a href="pressure%20group">pressure group</a> called the <a href="Democracy%20Movement">Democracy Movement</a>, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UK Independence Party</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201998%29">Democratic Party</a>.

The United Kingdom joined the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) in 1973, which transformed itself into the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) in 1993 via the <a href="Maastricht%20Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>. The EU differed from the EEC in having greater political authority, resulting in some reduction of the sovereignty of its member-states. The UK's ratification of the treaty in 1992, followed by its passing of the <a href="European%20Communities%20%28Finance%29%20Act">European Communities (Finance) Act</a> in 1994–95, had generated much controversy and infighting within the UK's <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, which was then in government under Prime Minister <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>. This caused much damage to Major's administration, which was increasingly unpopular among the British population. Various British newspapers, among them "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>", "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", had adopted a consistently Eurosceptic position. Opinion polls suggested growing opposition to aspects of the EU in the UK. More widely, the acceleration of the EU's integration process had resulted in the growth of Eurosceptic parties across many of its member states.

The Anglo-French businessman <a href="James%20Goldsmith">James Goldsmith</a> announced the formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a <a href="superstate">superstate</a> governed by centralised institutions in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an <a href="economic%20protectionism">economic protectionist</a>, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the <a href="General%20Agreement%20on%20Tariffs%20and%20Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a>, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.

Goldsmith had prior political experience, having been elected as a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a> (MEP) in France as part of the Eurosceptic <a href="Movement%20for%20France">Movement for France</a> coalition <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%201994%20%28France%29">in June 1994</a>. Although <a href="Frank%20Goldsmith">his father</a> had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a> <a href="Ross%20Perot%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201992">in the United States</a> and <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> in Italy.

According to the political scientists <a href="Matthew%20Goodwin">Matthew Goodwin</a> and Robert Ford, the Referendum Party was "a classic <a href="Single-issue%20politics">single-issue</a> party". Similarly, the political scientists Neil Carter, Mark Evans, Keith Alderman, and Simon Gorham described it as a "single-issue movement" that had attributes of both a <a href="political%20party">political party</a> and a <a href="Advocacy%20group">pressure group</a>. While it took part in elections, it focused on a single issue and stated that if it got <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">Members of Parliament</a> (MP) elected their sole aim would be to secure a referendum. It also claimed that on achieving its main aim, the party would disband, unlike most political parties; as Goldsmith put in his October 1995 "Statement of Aims": "This is a single-issue biodegradable party which will be dissolved once we have achieved our aim."

The referendum question which the party proposed was announced on 28 November 1996: "Do you want the United Kingdom to be part of a federal Europe or do you want the United Kingdom to return to an association of sovereign nations that are part of a common trading market?" The political scientists <a href="David%20Butler%20%28psephologist%29">David Butler</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Kavanagh">Dennis Kavanagh</a> noted that this question was often mocked for its "unrealistic ambiguity", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the "Referendum Only Party". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was "wholly agnostic" about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. However, the wording of the party's main question led one group of political scientists to note that it "clearly revealed Goldsmith's Eurosceptic colours" and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.

In its first year, the Referendum Party had little established organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance to be accompanied with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise to carry out a political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included <a href="Lord%20McAlpine">Lord McAlpine</a>, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the <a href="Conservative%20Campaign%20Headquarters">Conservative Central Office</a> staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.

Rather than having members who paid a joining fee, the Referendum Party had "supporters" who could voluntarily donate money if they wished. By February 1997, the party claimed that it had 160,000 registered supporters, although some of these individuals had only requested information about it and had not actively registered as "supporters". The party issued a newspaper, "News from the Referendum Party", to attract wider attention to its aims and broaden its support. One issue, published in February 1996, was delivered to 24 million households at an estimated cost of £2 million.

The party also sought to attract the support of prominent figures from business, the arts, and academia, inviting them to its major events. In October 1996, it held a national conference in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, in which forty speakers addressed an audience of 5,000. Among the speakers were the actor <a href="Edward%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Edward Fox</a>, the ecologist <a href="David%20Bellamy">David Bellamy</a>, the politician <a href="George%20Thomas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Tonypandy">George Thomas</a>, and the zookeeper <a href="John%20Aspinall%20%28zoo%20owner%29">John Aspinall</a>. The conference had been staged largely to impress the media, at a cost of £750,000, although unsympathetic media outlets were reportedly banned from attending. By the time of the conference, the party was increasingly reflecting its Eurosceptic intentions, particularly with the use of slogans like "No Surrender to Brussels".

Early supporters fell largely into three types: committed Eurosceptics, disaffected Conservatives, and those who—though not necessarily being Eurosceptic—strongly believed that the British population deserved a referendum on EU membership. At the time the new party was largely seen as a threat to the governing Conservative Party, which was experiencing high levels of mid-term unpopularity. In September 1995, the party began recruiting candidates to contest the next general election. Goldsmith was also able to obtain celebrity endorsements. Despite Goldsmith's longstanding criticism of the mainstream media—he had previously stated that "reporting in England is a load of filth"—the party used its finances to promote its message in the media. It hired <a href="Ian%20Beaumont">Ian Beaumont</a>, who had formerly been the press officer to Thatcher's government, to work for it. The party paid for many full-page and some double-page advertisement in the UK's national newspapers, as well as two cinema advertisements. This generated criticism from those who accused it of "cheque-book politics" in the manner of Perot in the US. This financial backing and infrastructure contrasted with that of another single-issue Eurosceptic Party, the <a href="UK%20Independence%20Party">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP), which was operating with little finances and a skeleton organisation at the time.

Although the party had faced criticism and mockery, it gained much media exposure.
Two months before the 1997 election, the party gained an MP in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> when <a href="George%20Gardiner%20%28politician%29">George Gardiner</a>, the Conservative MP for <a href="Reigate%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Reigate</a>, switched allegiance to the Referendum Party after his local Conservative branch deselected him due to critical comments that he had made about Major.

By the time of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a>, polls suggested that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the <a href="euro">euro</a> currency.

The Referendum Party decided not to contest any of the <a href="by-election">by-election</a>s that took place in 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its selection of candidates, who had only one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt that the event had been a public relations exercise rather than a concerted effort to train candidates.

Goldsmith's party was the biggest spender on press advertising in the 1997 campaign; it spent three times as much as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a <a href="Videotape%23Professional%20cassette%20formats">videocassette</a> to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: "The most important video you'll ever watch", "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on." The 12-minute film, presented by the former "<a href="That%27s%20Life%21">That's Life!</a>" presenter <a href="Gavin%20Campbell%20%28presenter%29">Gavin Campbell</a>, warned of a coming "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through "eerie sound effects", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor <a href="Helmut%20Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a> striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film "manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock."

The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> also permitted the party one five-minute <a href="party%20political%20broadcast">party political broadcast</a> because it was fielding over 50 candidates. The party insisted that it should have three such broadcasts, but the BBC claimed that this was disproportionate for a smaller, new party with no elected representation. The party took the issue to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a>, which sided with the BBC. The broadcast featured Goldsmith talking directly to the camera, arguing for a referendum. Goldsmith implied that the BBC had a pro-EU agenda by referring to it as the "Brussels News Corporation", also claiming that there was a "conspiracy of silence" negatively impacting the coverage received by his party.

In 1996, both the Conservative and Labour Parties committed to the idea that they would require a referendum on any proposed <a href="Economic%20and%20Monetary%20Union%20of%20the%20European%20Union">economic and monetary union</a> with the EU; the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> had already committed to this idea. It is difficult to quantify what role the Referendum Party had on the adoption of this position. Goldsmith condemned the Conservatives' pledge as an "empty gesture". Concerned that they would lose votes to the Referendum Party, many in the Conservative Party were pressing Major to enter talks with Goldsmith, although the Prime Minister refused to engage in any formal dialogue. The electoral threat posed by Goldsmith's party was taken seriously among the Conservatives, with senior party figures like Major, <a href="Ken%20Clarke">Ken Clarke</a>, <a href="Douglas%20Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a>, <a href="Brian%20Mawhinney">Brian Mawhinney</a> and <a href="Michael%20Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a> launching vitriolic and often personal criticisms of Goldsmith and his group. Hurd declared that "the government's policy must not be put at the mercy of millionaires who play with British politics as a hobby or as a boost to newspaper sales".

In the general election, candidates for the Referendum Party stood in 547 constituencies, the most that any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. None of these candidates were in Northern Ireland. This was because Goldsmith had made an agreement with Northern Ireland's <a href="Ulster%20Unionist%20Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> that he would not field any candidates against them if their one MEP joined his <a href="Europe%20of%20Nations">Europe of Nations</a> grouping in the European Parliament, something that ensured that the grouping remained large enough to retain its Parliamentary funding. It also avoided putting up candidates in constituencies where the leading candidate (65 of them Conservatives, 26 Labour and 2 Liberal Democrats) was considered sympathetic to the Referendum Party's call for a referendum. Goldsmith appeared to acknowledge that it was unlikely to win any of the contested seats, stating that the party's success would be "judged solely by its total number of votes". The party officially launched its electoral campaign on 9 April 1997 at <a href="Newlyn">Newlyn</a> in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, where Goldsmith sought to whip up Eurosceptic sentiment among fishermen who were angry with the restrictions imposed by EU fishing quotas.

In the election, which took place on 1 May 1997, the Referendum Party polled 811,827 votes. This represented 2.6% of the national total, and the party averaged 3.1% in the seats which it contested. 42 of the party's candidates gained over 5% of the vote and thus saw the return of their deposits, which were then priced at £500 each; 505 deposits were lost.
The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media attention was focused on the seat of <a href="Putney%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Putney</a>, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP <a href="David%20Mellor">David Mellor</a>; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of <a href="English%20nationalism">English nationalism</a> rather than <a href="British%20nationalism">British nationalism</a>. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.

The general election resulted in a victory for <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>'s Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Labour's victory was considered a <a href="landslide%20victory">landslide</a>, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many and the impact of the Referendum Party was not a major factor.

The Referendum Party nevertheless may have cost the Conservatives certain seats. Many Conservatives themselves believed that this was the case. As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of polling data, "voters for the Referendum Party were certainly not a cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. Hardly anyone who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith's party." Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath "et al." noted that "voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues." Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their Euroscepticism.

According to analysis by the political scientist <a href="John%20Curtice">John Curtice</a> and <a href="Psephology">psephologist</a> <a href="Michael%20Steed">Michael Steed</a>, "only a handful of the Conservatives' losses of seats can be blamed on the intervention of the Referendum Party". Their estimate was that only four seats would have been Conservative without the Referendum Party standing. For this reason, Butler and Kavanagh stated that the Referendum Party "had only a limited effect on the Conservative' fortunes". On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had a greater impact on the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote. Their analysis further suggested that there were 16 seats where the involvement of the Referendum Party directly cost the Conservative candidate their victory, and a further three where it was a contributing factor to the Conservatives' failure.

Immediately after the election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement.

Huia

The huia (; "Heteralocha acutirostris") is an extinct species of <a href="Callaeidae">New Zealand wattlebird</a>, <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> of New Zealand. The last confirmed sighting of a huia was in 1907, although there were credible sightings as late as the early 1960s.

Its <a href="extinction">extinction</a> had two primary causes. The first was rampant <a href="Overexploitation">overhunting</a> to procure huia skins for <a href="Taxidermy">mounted specimens</a> and their tail feathers for hat decorations. The second major cause was the widespread <a href="Deforestation%20in%20New%20Zealand">deforestation</a> of the lowlands of the North Island by European settlers to create pasture for agriculture. Most of these forests were ancient, ecologically complex <a href="primary%20forest">primary forest</a>s, and huia were unable to survive in regenerating <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a>s.

It was already a rare bird before the <a href="History%20of%20New%20Zealand%23Early%20contact%20period">arrival of Europeans</a>, confined to the <a href="Ruahine%20Range">Ruahine</a>, <a href="Tararua%20Range">Tararua</a>, <a href="Rimutaka%20Range">Rimutaka</a> and <a href="Kaimanawa%20Range">Kaimanawa mountain ranges</a> in the south-east of the North Island. It was remarkable for having the most pronounced <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in bill shape of any bird species in the world. The female's beak was long, thin and arched downward, while the male's was short and stout, like that of a <a href="crow">crow</a>. Males were long, while females were larger at . The sexes were otherwise similar, with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a green sheen. The huia was a bird of deep metallic, bluish-black plumage with a greenish iridescence on the upper surface, especially about the head. The tail feathers were unique among endemic birds in having a broad white band across the tips.

The birds lived in forests at both <a href="Montane%20forest">montane</a> and lowland elevations – they are thought to have moved seasonally, living at higher elevation in summer and descending to lower elevation in winter. Huia were <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and ate adult insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of <a href="Flora%20of%20New%20Zealand">native plants</a>. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood, while the female's longer, more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and <a href="ornithology">ornithology</a> textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction.

The huia is one of New Zealand's best-known extinct birds because of its bill shape, its sheer beauty and special place in <a href="M%C4%81ori%20culture">Māori culture</a> and <a href="M%C4%81ori%20mythology">oral tradition</a>. The bird was regarded by <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> as "<a href="Tapu%20%28Polynesian%20culture%29">tapu</a>" (sacred), and the wearing of its skin or feathers was reserved for people of high status.

The genus name, "Heteralocha", derives from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ἕτερος" "different" and "ἄλοχος" "wife". It refers to the striking difference in bill shape between male and female. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "acutirostris", derives from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "acutus", meaning "sharp pointed", and "rostrum", meaning "beak", and refers to the beak of the female.

<a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> described the huia in 1836 as two species: "Neomorpha acutirostris" based on a female specimen, and "N. crassirostris" based on a male specimen—the epithet "crassirostris" derives from the Latin "crassus", meaning "thick" or "heavy", and refers to the male's short bill. In 1840, <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> proposed the name "N. gouldii", arguing that neither of Gould's names was applicable to the species. In 1850, <a href="Jean%20Cabanis">Jean Cabanis</a> replaced the name "Neomorpha", which had been previously used for a <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a> genus, with "Heteralocha". In 1888 Sir <a href="Walter%20Buller">Walter Buller</a> wrote: "I have deemed it more in accordance with the accepted rules of zoological nomenclature to adopt the first of the two names applied to the species by Mr Gould; and the name "Neomorpha" having been previously used in ornithology, it becomes necessary to adopt that of "Heteralocha", proposed by Dr Cabanis for this form."

The huia appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of <a href="passerines">passerines</a> in the country of New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family <a href="Callaeidae">Callaeidae</a>, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the <a href="Saddleback%20%28bird%29">saddleback</a> and the <a href="k%C5%8Dkako">kōkako</a>. The only close relative to the family is the <a href="stitchbird">stitchbird</a>; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.

The huia had black plumage with a green metallic tinge and distinctive rounded bright orange <a href="Wattle%20%28anatomy%29">wattle</a>s at the <a href="gape">gape</a>. In both sexes, the eyes were brown; the beak was ivory white, greyish at the base; the legs and feet were long and bluish grey while the claws were light brown. Huia had twelve long glossy black tail feathers, each tipped for with a broad band of white. Immature huia had small pale wattles, duller plumage flecked with brown, and a reddish-buff tinge to the white tips of the tail feathers. The beak of the young female was only slightly curved. <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> referred to certain huia as "huia-ariki", "chiefly huia". The "huia-ariki" had brownish plumage streaked with grey, and the feathers on the neck and head were darker. This variant may have been a partial <a href="albinism">albino</a>, or perhaps such birds were simply of great age. Several true albino huia were recorded. A white specimen painted by <a href="John%20Gerrard%20Keulemans">John Gerrard Keulemans</a> around 1900 may have been the result of progressive greying or <a href="leucism">leucism</a>, rather than albinism; the current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. 

Although sexual dimorphism in bill shape is found in other birds, such as the <a href="Ptiloris">riflebirds</a>, <a href="Epimachus">sicklebills</a> and other wood-excavating birds including some species of <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>, it was most pronounced in the huia. The beak of the male was short at approximately and slightly arched downwards and robust, very similar to that of the closely related saddleback, while the female's beak was finer, longer at around , and decurved (curved downward) like that of a <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a> or <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>. The difference was not only in the bone; the <a href="rhamphotheca">rhamphotheca</a> grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood-boring beetle larvae. The skulls and mandibles of the huia and saddleback are very similar, the latter essentially miniatures of the former.

There are two possible explanations for the evolution of this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen because of a lack of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.

Another, less obvious aspect of the huia's sexual dimorphism was the minor size difference between the sexes. Males were long, while females were larger at . Additionally, the tail of the male was about in length and the wingspan was between , while the female's tail was and the female's wingspan was .

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> deposits and <a href="midden">midden</a> remains reveal that the huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a>, extending from the northernmost tip at <a href="Cape%20Reinga">Cape Reinga</a> to <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> and the <a href="Aorangi%20Range">Aorangi Range</a> in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the <a href="karst">karst</a> of the <a href="Waitomo%20Caves">Waitomo Caves</a> area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and <a href="Hawke%27s%20Bay%20Region">Hawke's Bay</a>; it seems to have preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. The huia vanished from the northern and western North Island following Māori settlement in the 14th century, due to over-hunting, forest clearance, and introduced <a href="Polynesian%20rat">kiore</a> preying on nests. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s it was only found south of a line from the <a href="Raukumara%20Range">Raukumara Range</a> in the east, across the <a href="Kaimanawa%20Range">Kaimanawa Range</a>, to the <a href="Turakina%20River">Turakina River</a> in the <a href="Rangitikei%20District">Rangitikei</a> in the west. In the south, its range extended to the <a href="Wairarapa">Wairarapa</a> and the <a href="Rimutaka%20Range">Rimutaka Range</a> east of Wellington. Reports collected by <a href="Walter%20Buller">Walter Buller</a> and a single "waiata" (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.

The huia inhabited both of the two principal forest types in New Zealand. They were primarily found in <a href="Temperate%20rainforest%23New%20Zealand%20temperate%20rain%20forests">broadleaf-podocarp</a> forests where there was a dense understorey, but occasionally also in southern beech ("<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>") forest. The species was observed in native vegetation including mataī ("<a href="Prumnopitys%20taxifolia">Prumnopitys taxifolia</a>"), rimu ("<a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">Dacrydium cupressinum</a>"), kahikatea ("<a href="Dacrycarpus%20dacrydioides">Dacrycarpus dacrydioides</a>"), northern rātā ("<a href="Metrosideros%20robusta">Metrosideros robusta</a>"), maire ("<a href="Nestegis">Nestegis</a>"), hinau ("<a href="Elaeocarpus%20dentatus">Elaeocarpus dentatus</a>"), totara ("<a href="Podocarpus%20totara">Podocarpus totara</a>"), rewarewa ("<a href="Knightia%20excelsa">Knightia excelsa</a>"), mahoe ("<a href="Melicytus%20ramiflorus">Melicytus ramiflorus</a>"), and taraire ("<a href="Beilschmiedia%20tarairi">Beilschmiedia tarairi</a>"), and at sea level in karaka ("<a href="Corynocarpus%20laevigatus">Corynocarpus laevigatus</a>") trees at <a href="Turakirae%20Head">Cape Turakirae</a>. It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming.

The huia's movements are little known, but it was most likely sedentary. The huia is thought to have undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.

The huia, with the previously endangered saddleback, were the two species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore <a href="Guild%20%28ecology%29">guild</a> in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace's line</a>; their <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and "Nothofagus" forests; one was the huia and the other was the <a href="New%20Zealand%20kaka">kaka</a>.

The huia foraged mainly on decaying wood. Although it was considered a specialist predator of the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of the <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> huhu beetle ("<a href="Prionoplus%20reticularis">Prionoplus reticularis</a>"), it also ate other insects—including <a href="weta">weta</a>—insect larvae, spiders, and fruit.

Insects and spiders were taken from decaying wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its <a href="adze">adze</a>-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by "gaping" motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature of the head and neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed <a href="depressor%20jaw%20muscles">depressor jaw muscles</a>, and an <a href="internal%20occipital%20crest">occipital crest</a> that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.
Pairs did not cooperate in feeding, at least not in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist <a href="Walter%20Buller">Walter Buller</a> of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of <a href="niche%20differentiation">niche differentiation</a>, reducing <a href="intraspecific%20competition">intraspecific competition</a> between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.

The New Zealand forest relies heavily on <a href="frugivorous">frugivorous</a> birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are probably dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau ("<a href="Elaeocarpus%20dentatus">Elaeocarpus dentatus</a>"), pigeonwood ("<a href="Hedycarya%20arborea">Hedycarya arborea</a>") and various species of "<a href="Coprosma">Coprosma</a>" are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea ("<a href="Dacrycarpus%20dacrydioides">Dacrycarpus dacrydioides</a>"). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the <a href="moa">moa</a> and <a href="North%20Island%20piopio">piopio</a>, and the diminishing range of many others, including the <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>, <a href="weka">weka</a>, and <a href="k%C5%8Dkako">kōkako</a>, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1 cm in diameter, <a href="kereru">kereru</a> are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.

Like so many other aspects of its biology, the vocalisations of the huia are not well known, and present knowledge is based on very few accounts. The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles, "peculiar and strange", but also "soft, melodious and flute-like". An imitation of the bird's call survives as a recording of 1909 huia search team member Henare Hamana whistling the call (see "External links"). Huia were often silent. When they did vocalise, their calls could carry considerable distances – some were audible from up to away through dense forest. The calls were said to differ between sexes, though there are no details. Calls were given with the bird's head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical. Most references describe huia calls as heard in the early morning; one records it as the first bird to sing in the <a href="Dawn%20chorus%20%28birds%29">dawn chorus</a>, and captive birds were known to "wake the household". Like the <a href="Whitehead%20%28bird%29">whitehead</a>, huia behaved unusually before the onset of wet weather, being "happy and in full song". The bird's name is <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>: it was named by Māori for its loud distress call, a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as "uia, uia, uia" or "where are you?". This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry. Chicks had a "plaintive cry, pleasant to the ear", would feebly answer imitations by people, and were very noisy when kept in tents.

A species of parasitic <a href="Philopteridae">phtilopterid</a> <a href="louse">louse</a>, "<a href="Rallicola%20extinctus">Rallicola extinctus</a>", was only known to live on the huia, and apparently became <a href="Coextinction">extinct with its host</a>. In 2008, a new species of feather mite, "Coraciacarus muellermotzfeldi", was described from dried corpses found in the feathers of a huia skin held by a European museum. While the genus "Coraciacarus" has a wide range of hosts globally, the presence of a representative of the genus on a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird was an "enigmatic phenomenon". The discoverers suggested the mite could have been horizontally transferred from one of the two native, migratory species of <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a> (Cuculiformes).

A quiet, social bird, the huia was <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a>, and pairs probably paired for life. The bird was usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes groups of four or more were encountered. <a href="Walter%20Buller">Walter Buller</a> records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other, constantly uttering a "low affectionate twitter", even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair and a further, wild pair "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" and uttering these noises. The male is said to have fed the female in courtship. It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest "lacks evidence". When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female "manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards". A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: "I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms ... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief". The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest, and birds could easily be captured by hand.

Little is known about the huia's reproduction, as only two eggs and four nests were ever described. The only known huia egg to still exist is in the collection of the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</a>. The breeding season for mating, building nests, laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring (October–November). It is thought they nested solitarily; pairs are said to have been <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> and the birds would remain on their territories for life. Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season; the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3–5, 4, 2–4 and 1–4. These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles, and measured . <a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> was mostly by the female, though there is evidence that the male also had a small role, as rubbed-bare <a href="brooding%20patch">brooding patch</a>es that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November. The incubation period is unknown. Eggshells were apparently removed from the nest by adults. The brood size was usually one or two, though there was the odd record of up to three chicks in a single nest. Nests were constructed in varying places: in dead trees, the crooks of large branches, tree hollows, on branches, or "on or near the ground", and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines. The nest itself was a large saucer-shaped structure, up to 350 mm in diameter and 70 mm deep, with thick walls of dry grass, leaves and "withered stems of herbaceous plants". A central small, shallow cup of soft materials such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs. After hatching, young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months, by which time they appeared adult.

In Māori culture, the "white heron and the Huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes, worn by people of high rank". The bold and inquisitive nature of the huia made it particularly easy to capture. Māori attracted the huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a "tari" (a carved pole with a noose at the end) or snare, or killed it with clubs or long spears. Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair, which would then call out, attracting its mate, which could be easily captured. Opinion on the quality of huia meat as food varied wildly; although not usually hunted for this purpose, the huia was considered "good eating" in pies or curried stew by some, but a "tough morsel" and "unfit to eat" by others.

Although the huia's range was restricted to the southern North Island, its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as <a href="pounamu">pounamu</a> and shark teeth, or given as tokens of friendship and respect. Through this trade, the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand. They were stored in intricately carved boxes called "<a href="waka%20huia">waka huia</a>", which were hung from the ceilings of chiefs' houses. Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate the heads of the deceased. The "marereko", described by <a href="Edward%20Robert%20Tregear">Edward Robert Tregear</a> as an "ancient war-plume", consisted of twelve huia feathers. The highly valued "pōhoi" was an ornament made from the skin of the huia: the bird was skinned with the beak, skull and wattles attached and the legs and wings removed, carefully dried, and the resulting ornament worn from the neck or ears. Dried huia heads were also worn as pendants called "ngutu huia". A captured huia would be kept in a small cage so that its tail feathers could be plucked as they grew to full size.

The bird was also kept by Māori as a pet, and like the <a href="Tui%20%28bird%29">tui</a>, it could be trained to say a few words. There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European settlers in a small village in the <a href="Tararua%20District">Forty-Mile Bush</a> in the 19th century.

New Zealand has released several postage stamps portraying the huia, and the New Zealand sixpence circulated from 1933 to 1966 featured a female huia on the reverse.

The degree to which the huia was known and admired in New Zealand is reflected in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species. There are several roads and streets named after the huia in the North Island, with several in Wellington (including Huia Road in <a href="Eastbourne%2C%20New%20Zealand">Days Bay</a> – not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of <a href="East%20Harbour%20Regional%20Park">East Harbour Regional Park</a>) and also in Auckland, where there is even a <a href="Huia%2C%20New%20Zealand">Huia</a> suburb in <a href="Waitakere%20City">Waitakere</a>. A <a href="Huia%20River">river</a> on the west coast of the South Island and the <a href="Huiarau%20Range">Huiarau Range</a>s in the central North Island are also named after the bird. The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains: "Huiarau" means "a hundred huia". Businesses include the public swimming pool in <a href="Lower%20Hutt">Lower Hutt</a>, a <a href="Marlborough%20Region">Marlborough</a> winery, and <a href="Huia%20Publishers">Huia Publishers</a>, which specialises in Māori writing and perspectives. The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century, to the son of members of a lower North Island "<a href="iwi">iwi</a>" concerned about the bird's rapid decline, and although uncommon, it is still used today in New Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys (e.g. <a href="Huia%20Edmonds">Huia Edmonds</a>), of both European and Māori descent.

Tail feathers of the extinct huia are very rare and they have become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for <a href="NZ%24">NZ$</a>8,000, much higher than the $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a> feather at auction in the United States.

In the 2016 New Zealand film "<a href="Hunt%20for%20the%20Wilderpeople">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a>" two of the characters encounter a huia, and eventually set out to obtain proof of their sighting.

The huia was found throughout the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. Māori are estimated to have arrived around 750 years ago, and by the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction, hunting, and introduced rats had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a "<a href="r%C4%81hui">rāhui</a>" (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. After European settlement the huia's numbers began to decline more quickly, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.

Like the extinctions of other New Zealand birds such as the <a href="North%20Island%20piopio">piopio</a> in the 19th century, the decline of the huia was poorly studied. Massive deforestation occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern <a href="Hawkes%20Bay">Hawkes Bay</a>, the <a href="Manawatu">Manawatu</a> and the <a href="Wairarapa">Wairarapa</a>, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a>s. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.

It appears that predation by invasive mammalian species including <a href="Black%20rat">ship rat</a>s, cats, and <a href="mustelid">mustelid</a>s was an additional factor in the decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand <a href="Acclimatisation%20societies%20in%20New%20Zealand">acclimatisation societies</a> peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it spent a lot of time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the <a href="common%20myna">common myna</a>.

Habitat destruction and the predations of introduced species were problems faced by all New Zealand birds, but in addition the huia faced massive pressure from hunting. Due to its pronounced sexual dimorphism and its beauty, huia were sought after as <a href="taxidermy">mounted specimens</a> by wealthy collectors in Europe and by museums all over the world. These individuals and institutions were willing to pay large sums of money for good specimens, and the overseas demand created a strong financial incentive for hunters in New Zealand. This hunting was initially by naturalists. Austrian taxidermist <a href="Andreas%20Reischek">Andreas Reischek</a> took 212 pairs as specimens for the natural history museum in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> over a period of 10 years, while New Zealand ornithologist <a href="Walter%20Buller">Walter Buller</a> collected 18 on just one of several expeditions to the <a href="Rimutaka%20Range">Rimutaka Range</a>s in 1883. Others keen to profit soon joined in. Buller records that also in 1883, a party of 11 Māori obtained 646 huia skins from the forest between the <a href="Manawatu%20Gorge">Manawatu Gorge</a> and <a href="Akitio">Akitio</a>. Several thousand huia were exported overseas as part of this trade. Infrastructure development within lowland forest did not help the situation: hundreds of huia were shot around road and rail construction camps. 

The rampant and unsustainable hunting was not just financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.

There were some attempts to conserve the huia, but they were few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a> in New Zealand was still very much in its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a <a href="r%C4%81hui">rāhui</a> on the <a href="Tararua%20Range">Tararua Range</a>. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including <a href="Kapiti%20Island">Kapiti Island</a>, <a href="Little%20Barrier%20Island">Little Barrier Island</a> and <a href="Resolution%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Resolution Island</a>, were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for <a href="Baron%20Rothschild">Lord Rothschild</a>, along with the last collected live pair of <a href="laughing%20owl">laughing owl</a>s.

The <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke</a> and <a href="Duchess%20of%20York">Duchess of York</a> (later <a href="George%20V">George V</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an official Māori welcome in <a href="Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, a guide took a huia tail feather from her hair and placed it in the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold for as much as £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.

The decline of the huia over the southern half of the North Island occurred at markedly different rates in different locations. Areas where dramatic declines were observed in the 1880s included the Puketoi Range, the <a href="Hutt%20Valley">Hutt Valley</a> and Tararuas, and the <a href="Pahiatua">Pahiatua</a>-<a href="Dannevirke">Dannevirke</a> area. The species was abundant in a few places in the early 20th century between Hawke's Bay and the Wairarapa; a flock of 100–150 birds was reported at the summit of the Akatarawa–Waikanae track in 1905; they were still "fairly plentiful" in the upper reaches of the <a href="Rangitikei%20River">Rangitikei River</a> in 1906 – and yet, the last confirmed sighting came just one year later.

The last official, confirmed huia sighting was made on 28 December 1907 when W. W. Smith saw three birds in the forests of the Tararua Ranges. Unconfirmed, "quite credible" reports suggest that extinction for the species came a little later. A man familiar with the species reported seeing three huia in Gollans Valley behind York Bay (between <a href="Petone">Petone</a> and <a href="Eastbourne%2C%20New%20Zealand">Eastbourne</a> on Wellington Harbour), an area of mixed beech and podocarp forest well within the bird's former range, on 28 December 1922. Sightings of the huia were also reported there in 1912 and 1913. Despite this, naturalists from the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Dominion Museum</a> in Wellington did not investigate the reports. The last credible reports of huia come from the forests of <a href="Te%20Urewera%20National%20Park">Te Urewera National Park</a>, with one from near Mt Urutawa in 1952 and final sightings near <a href="Lake%20Waikareiti">Lake Waikareiti</a> in 1961 and 1963. The possibility of a small huia population still surviving in the Urewera ranges has been proposed by some researchers, but is considered highly unlikely. No recent expeditions have been mounted to find a living specimen.

Students at <a href="Hastings%20Boys%27%20High%20School">Hastings Boys' High School</a> organised a conference in 1999 to consider <a href="cloning">cloning</a> the huia, their school emblem. The tribe <a href="Ng%C4%81ti%20Huia">Ngāti Huia</a> agreed in principle to support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a>, and a California-based Internet start-up volunteered $100,000 of funding. However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</a>, said that the complete huia <a href="genome">genome</a> could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.

Mortara case

The Mortara case () was an Italian "<a href="cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre">cause célèbre</a>" that captured the attention of much of Europe and North America in the 1850s and 1860s. It concerned the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>' seizing from a Jewish family in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> of one of their children, six-year-old Edgardo Mortara (August 27, 1851 – March 11, 1940), on the basis of a former servant's testimony that she had administered <a href="emergency%20baptism">emergency baptism</a> to the boy when he fell sick as an infant. Mortara grew up as a Catholic under the protection of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a>—who refused his parents' desperate pleas for his return—and eventually became a priest. The domestic and international outrage against the pontifical state's actions may have contributed to its downfall amid the <a href="Italian%20unification">unification of Italy</a>.

In late 1857, Bologna's <a href="inquisitor">inquisitor</a> Father Pier Feletti heard that Anna Morisi, who had worked in the Mortara house for six years, had secretly baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith">Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition</a> held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be kidnapped from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and kidnapped Edgardo the following evening.

After the child's father was allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly different narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted to return to his family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the <a href="catechism">catechism</a> perfectly and wanted his parents to become Catholics as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's kidnapping, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> <a href="Capture%20of%20Rome">captured the city in 1870</a>, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was <a href="Holy%20Orders%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">ordained</a> in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara spent most of his life outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.

For many, the Vatican's actions encapsulated all that was wrong with the Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair as one of the most significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian <a href="David%20Kertzer">David Kertzer</a> has marked the start of a wider re-examination.

For more than a millennium, starting around 754, the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> were territories in Italy under the direct sovereign rule of the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>. The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>'s control over <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and a neighbouring swathe of central Italy was generally seen as a manifestation of the Pope's secular <a href="Temporal%20power%20%28papal%29">"temporal" power</a>, as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy. After the end of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in 1815, the other main <a href="Historical%20states%20of%20Italy">Italian states</a> were the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Kingdom of Sardinia</a>—governed from <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> on the mainland by <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20II%20of%20Italy">King Victor Emmanuel II</a>—the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a> in the south, and the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Tuscany">Grand Duchy of Tuscany</a> in the west. The <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French occupation during the 1790s</a> had led the Pope's popularity and spiritual authority to greatly increase, but had also severely damaged the geopolitical credibility of the Papal States. The historian <a href="David%20Kertzer">David Kertzer</a> suggests that by the 1850s "what had once appeared so solid—a product of the divine order of things—now seemed terribly fragile".

<a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a>, elected in 1846, was initially widely seen as a great reformer and moderniser who might throw his weight behind the growing movement for <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian unification</a>—referred to in Italian as the Risorgimento (meaning "Resurgence"). When the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Italian%20states">revolutions of 1848 broke out</a>, however, he refused to support a pan-Italian campaign against the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, which controlled <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy%E2%80%93Venetia">Lombardy–Venetia</a> in the north-east. This prompted a popular uprising in the Papal States, Pope Pius's flight to the Two Sicilies, and the proclamation in 1849 of the short-lived <a href="Roman%20Republic%20%2819th%20century%29">Roman Republic</a>, which was crushed by Austrian and French intervention in support of the Pope. Rome was thereafter guarded by French troops while Austrians garrisoned the rest of the Papal States, much to the resentment of most of the inhabitants. Pope Pius shared the traditional pontifical view that the Papal States were essential to his independence as head of the Catholic Church. He regained some of his popularity during the 1850s, but the drive for Italian unification spearheaded by the Kingdom of Sardinia continued to unsettle him.

The Jews of the Papal States, numbering 15,000 or so in 1858, were grateful to Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on <a href="Weekly%20Torah%20portion">that week's Torah portion</a> and aimed at their <a href="conversion%20to%20Christianity">conversion to Christianity</a>. He had also torn down the gates of the <a href="Roman%20Ghetto">Roman Ghetto</a> despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority still lived in the ghetto.

Edgardo Levi Mortara, the sixth of eight children born to Salomone "Momolo" Mortara, a Jewish merchant, and his wife Marianna ("née" Padovani), was born on 27 August 1851 in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, one of the <a href="Papal%20Legations">Papal Legations</a> in the pontifical state's far north. The family had moved in 1850 from the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Modena%20and%20Reggio">Duchy of Modena</a>, just west of Bologna. Bologna's Jewish population of about 900 had been expelled in 1593 by <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VIII">Pope Clement VIII</a>. Some Jews, mostly merchants like Edgardo's father, had started to settle in Bologna again during the 1790s, and by 1858 there was a Jewish community of about 200 in the city. The Jews of Bologna practised Judaism discreetly, with neither a <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> nor a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>. The Papal States officially forbade them to have Christian servants, but observant Jewish families perceived <a href="gentile">gentile</a> maids as essential because they were not covered by <a href="Halakha">Jewish laws</a>, and thus provided a way for Jews to have <a href="Shabbos%20goy">household tasks carried out</a> while still observing their <a href="Shabbat">Sabbath</a>. In practice Church authorities turned a blind eye, and almost every Jewish family in Bologna employed at least one Catholic woman.

A few months after Edgardo's birth, the Mortara family engaged a new servant: Anna "Nina" Morisi, an 18-year-old Catholic from the nearby village of <a href="San%20Giovanni%20in%20Persiceto">San Giovanni in Persiceto</a>. Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She had come to the city, following her three sisters, to work and save money towards a <a href="dowry">dowry</a> so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at this time. Many employers would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not; they paid for Morisi to spend the last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife's home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an <a href="orphanage">orphanage</a>, as the Papal States required unwed mothers to do, then returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857; soon after that she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.

In October 1857 the <a href="inquisitor">inquisitor</a> of Bologna, the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> friar Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, learned of rumours to the effect that a secret <a href="baptism">baptism</a> had been administered to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic in the eyes of the Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be kidnapped from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be <a href="Salvation%20%28Christianity%29">saved</a> and go to <a href="Heaven%20%28Christianity%29">Heaven</a>, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.
The servant identified in the rumours was Anna Morisi. After receiving written permission to investigate from the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith">Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition</a> (also called the Holy Office), the body of <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinals</a> responsible for overseeing and defending <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20theology">Catholic doctrine</a>, Feletti interrogated her at the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Domenico">Basilica of San Domenico</a> in Bologna. Morisi averred that while she was employed by the Mortaras, their infant son Edgardo had fallen gravely sick while in her care, leading her to fear he might die. She said that she had performed an <a href="emergency%20baptism">emergency baptism</a> herself—sprinkling some water on the boy's head and saying: "I baptise you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"—but had never revealed this to the child's family. Edgardo had since recovered. Feletti had Morisi swear to keep the story quiet and sent a transcript of the meeting to Rome, requesting permission to kidnap the now six-year-old Edgardo from his family.

It is not known by historians whether Pope Pius IX was involved in any of the early Holy Office discussions over Mortara, or was otherwise aware of Feletti's initial investigation. He was its official head but he only occasionally attended its meetings, and was not likely to be consulted about what the cardinals saw as routine matters. For the Holy Office, situations such as that reported by Feletti presented a profound quandary—on the one hand the Church officially disapproved of <a href="forced%20conversion">forced conversion</a>s, but on the other it held that the baptismal sacrament was sacrosanct and that if it had been properly administered, the recipient was thereafter a member of the Christian communion. In accordance with the 1747 papal bull "<a href="Postremo%20mense">Postremo mense</a>", the laws of the Papal States held that it was illegal to kidnap a child from non-Christian parents for baptism (unless it was dying), but if such a child was indeed baptised the Church was held to bear responsibility to provide a Christian education and remove it from its parents. The cardinals considered Morisi's account and ultimately accepted it as bearing "all the earmarks of the truth without leaving the least doubt about the reality and the validity of the baptism she performed". Feletti was instructed to arrange Edgardo's kidnapping and transport to the <a href="House%20of%20Catechumens">House of Catechumens</a> in Rome, where instruction was given to those newly converted or in the process of converting to Catholicism.

A detail of papal <a href="carabinieri">carabinieri</a> (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini arrived at the Mortara apartment in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: "Signor Mortara, I am sorry to inform you that you are the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to kidnap Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked that they would have to kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene."

Lucidi offered to let Edgardo's father accompany them to the inquisitor to discuss the matter with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. When the men begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.

The Mortaras spent the morning of 24 June attempting to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's <a href="Papal%20legate">cardinal legate</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Milesi%20Pironi%20Ferretti">Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti</a>, or the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Bologna">Archbishop of Bologna</a>, <a href="Michele%20Viale-Prel%C3%A0">Michele Viale-Prelà</a>, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided to take steps to make the kidnapping as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.

Momolo came home to find the apartment empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and stole Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police down the stairs to the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.

With no way of knowing where the boy had been taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, supported by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a>, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's kidnapping to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode as an example of papal tyranny.

Anxious to protect the Papal States' precarious diplomatic position, the <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a> <a href="Giacomo%20Antonelli">Giacomo Antonelli</a> liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, as opposed to the usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.

The attempts of the Mortaras and their allies to identify who was supposed to have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he had heard it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.

The younger Angelo Padovani went with De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani recalled finding her in tears. After the visitors assured her that they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide died at the age of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's kidnapping: "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their <a href="hearsay">hearsay</a> account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true."

Edgardo was visited by his father several times under the supervision of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.

The central theme in almost all renditions of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe that as a result of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on. ... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment."

There were many different versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying to learn as much as possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> in <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Sorrows">sorrow</a>, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for <a href="Mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">mass</a>, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic "L'armonia della religione colla civiltà," he had learned the <a href="catechism">catechism</a> perfectly within a few days, "blesse[d] the servant who baptised him," and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> periodical "<a href="La%20Civilt%C3%A0%20Cattolica">La Civiltà Cattolica</a>" in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope."

According to Kertzer, the proponents of this pro-Church narrative did not seem to realise that to many these accounts sounded "too good to be true" and "absurd". Kertzer comments: "If Edgardo in fact told his father that he did not want to return with him, that he now regarded the Pope as his true father and wanted to devote his life to converting the Jews, this message seems not to have registered with Momolo." Liberals, Protestants and Jews across the continent ridiculed the Catholic press reports. A booklet published in Brussels in 1859 outlined the two contrasting narratives, then concluded: "Between the miracle of a six-year-old apostle who wants to convert the Jews and the cry of a child who keeps asking for his mother and his little sisters, we don't hesitate for a moment." Mortara's parents furiously denounced the Catholic accounts as lies, but some of their supporters were less certain about where Edgardo's loyalties now lay. These included Scazzocchio, who had attended some of the disputed meetings at the Catechumens.

Momolo returned to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote to him that if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.

Carlo Maggi, a Catholic acquaintance of Momolo's who was also a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.

Momolo set out for Rome again on 11 October 1858, this time bringing Marianna with him in the hope that her presence might make a stronger impression on the Church and Edgardo. Anxious about the possible consequences of a dramatic reunification between mother and son, the rector Enrico Sarra took Edgardo from Rome to <a href="Alatri">Alatri</a>, his own home town about away. The Mortaras tracked them to a church in Alatri, where from the door Momolo saw a priest saying mass—and Edgardo by his side assisting him. Momolo waited outside, and afterwards persuaded the rector to let him see his son. Before this meeting could take place, the Mortaras were arrested on the orders of the Mayor of Alatri, himself following a request from <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Alatri">the town's bishop</a>, and despatched back to Rome. Antonelli was not impressed, thinking this an undignified line of action that would give obvious ammunition to the Church's detractors, and ordered Sarra to bring Edgardo back to the capital to meet his parents.

Edgardo returned to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms when he first saw her. Marianna later said: "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror ... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: "'Si, mia cara mamma", I will never forget to say the "<a href="Shema%20Yisrael">Shema</a>" every day.'" One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.

The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, described a boy very much resolved to stay where he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations to return to the Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to "La Civiltà Cattolica", Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article went so far as to claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">commandment</a> that a child should <a href="Honour%20thy%20father%20and%20thy%20mother">honour his father and mother</a>—"La Civiltà Cattolica" countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it "your most affectionate little son". <a href="Louis%20Veuillot">Louis Veuillot</a>, the <a href="Ultramontanism">ultramontane</a> editor of the "<a href="L%27Univers">L'Univers</a>" newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older ... so that he can speak to them of <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>, of God, and of the most Holy Mary."

Having made no progress in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara returned to Bologna in early December 1858, and soon afterwards moved to <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, in Piedmont. The case—an <a href="anti-Catholicism">anti-Catholic</a> "publicist's dream", to quote Kertzer—had by now become a massive controversy in both Europe and the United States, with voices across the social spectrum clamouring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his parents. Mortara became a "<a href="cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre">cause célèbre</a>" not only for Jews but for Protestant Christians as well, particularly in the United States, where <a href="anti-Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-Catholic sentiment abounded</a>—"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" published more than 20 articles on the case in December 1858 alone. In Britain, "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" presented the Mortara case as evidence that the Papal States had "the worst government in the world—the most insolvent and the most arrogant, the cruelest and the meanest". The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad steadfastly defended the Pope's actions. The pro-Church articles often took on an overtly <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitic</a> character, charging for example that if coverage in Britain, France or Germany was critical this was hardly a surprise "since currently the newspapers of Europe are in good part in the hands of the Jews". Scazzocchio suggested that the press storm attacking the Church was actually counter-productive for the Mortara family's cause, as it angered the Pope and thereby steeled his resolve not to compromise.

Regardless of whether Pope Pius IX had been personally involved in the decision to kidnap Mortara from his parents—whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press—what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore that erupted over the matter. He adopted the position, based on "Postremo mense", that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian family would be incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a> one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle. Those angered included <a href="Napoleon%20III">Emperor Napoleon III</a> of France, who found the situation particularly vexing as the pontifical government owed its very existence to the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope's temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics; the scandal over Mortara weakened this considerably and, according to the historian Roger Aubert, provided the final straw that changed French policy. In February 1859 Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy—most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.

It was then an annual custom for the Pope to receive a delegation from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" The Pope then calmed down somewhat: "So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so far as he could see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.

Pope Pius IX's determination to keep Edgardo developed into a strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cloak and calling out: "Where's the boy?" At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: "My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." He then said to others present: "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and accused me of being barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father."

The Italian Jewish appeals brought the attention of <a href="Moses%20Montefiore">Sir Moses Montefiore</a>, the president of the <a href="Board%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>, whose willingness to travel great distances to help his co-religionists—as he had over the <a href="Damascus%20affair">Damascus blood libel</a> of 1840, for example—was already well known. From August to December 1858 he headed a special British committee on Mortara that relayed reports from Piedmont to British newspapers and Catholic clergymen, and happily noted the support expressed by British Protestants, particularly the <a href="Evangelical%20Alliance">Evangelical Alliance</a> led by <a href="Culling%20Eardley">Sir Culling Eardley</a>. After unsuccessfully attempting to have the British government lodge an official protest with the Vatican, Montefiore resolved to personally travel to Rome to present a petition to the Pope calling for Edgardo to be returned to his parents. He arrived in Rome on 5 April 1859.

Montefiore failed to gain an audience with the Pope, and was received by Cardinal Antonelli only on 28 April. Montefiore gave him the Board of Deputies' petition to pass on to the Pope, and said that he would wait in the city a week for the pontiff's reply. Two days later, news reached Rome that fighting had broken out between Austrian and Piedmontese troops in the north—the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">War of 1859</a> had begun. While most foreign dignitaries fled Rome as quickly as possible, Montefiore waited in vain for the Pope's response; he finally left on 10 May. On his return to Britain more than 2,000 leading citizens—including 79 mayors and <a href="Provost%20%28civil%29">provosts</a>, 27 peers, 22 Anglican bishops and archbishops and 36 <a href="member%20of%20parliament">members of parliament</a>—signed a protest calling the Pope's conduct a "dishonour to Christianity", "repulsive to the instincts of humanity". Meanwhile, the Church quietly had Edgardo <a href="Confirmation%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">confirmed</a> as a Catholic in a private chapel on 13 May 1859. Edgardo was by this time no longer in the Catechumens but at <a href="San%20Pietro%20in%20Vincoli">San Pietro in Vincoli</a>, a basilica elsewhere in Rome where Pope Pius had personally decided the boy would be educated.

As the war turned against the Austrians, the garrison in Bologna left early in the morning on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a>. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor <a href="Luigi%20Carlo%20Farini">Luigi Carlo Farini</a> issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.

Momolo Mortara spent late 1859 and January 1860 in Paris and London, trying to rally support. While he was away his father Simon, who lived about west of Bologna in <a href="Reggio%20Emilia">Reggio Emilia</a>, successfully asked the new authorities in Romagna to launch an inquiry into the Mortara case. On 31 December 1859 Farini ordered his justice minister to pursue the "authors of the kidnapping". Filippo Curletti, the new director-general of police for Romagna, was put in charge of the investigation. After two officers identified the erstwhile inquisitor Feletti as having given the order to kidnap Edgardo, Curletti and a detachment of police went to San Domenico and arrested him at about 02:30 on 2 January 1860.

The police inspectors questioned Feletti, but each time they asked about anything to do with Mortara or his kidnapping the monk said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of the Holy Office. When Curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to the Mortara case, Feletti said that they had been burned—when asked when or how, he repeated that on Holy Office matters he could say nothing. Pressed further, Feletti said: "As far as the activities that I carried out as Inquisitor of the Holy Office of Bologna, I am obliged to explain myself to one forum only, to the Supreme Sacred Congregation in Rome, whose Prefect is His Holiness Pope Pius IX, and to no-one else." After the police searched the convent for documents relating to the Mortara case—they found nothing—the inquisitor was escorted to prison. The news that Feletti had been arrested caused the press storm surrounding Mortara, which had died down somewhat, to flare up again across Europe.

Father Feletti's trial was the first major criminal case in Bologna under the new authorities. The magistrate Francesco Carboni announced on 18 January 1860 that Feletti and Lieutenant-Colonel Luigi De Dominicis would be prosecuted, but not Lucidi or Agostini. When Carboni interviewed Feletti in prison on 23 January, the friar said that in seizing Edgardo from his family he had only carried out instructions from the Holy Office, "which never promulgates any decree without the consent of the Roman Pontiff". Feletti then recounted a version of the Church narrative of the case, stating that Edgardo had "always remained firm in his desire to remain a Christian" and was now studying successfully in Rome. He predicted in conclusion that Edgardo would one day be the "support and pride" of the Mortara family.

On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave an account of the case that contradicted the inquisitor's at almost every turn; in Rome, he said, Edgardo had been "frightened, and intimidated by the rector's presence, [but] he openly declared his desire to return home with us". Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo's crib and "reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die". She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour's servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism. As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, indeed saying he could not even remember Morisi. The "Regina" in Morisi's story was identified as Regina Bussolari; though Morisi averred to have told her the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had only spoken with Morisi "once or twice, when she was going up to the storage room to get something", and never about anything to do with the Mortaras' children.

Elena Pignatti, who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that "seven or eight years ago ... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and it was said that he was going to die. Around then, one morning ... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets <a href="indulgence">indulgence</a>; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.

Bussolari's denial that she had discussed any baptism with Morisi raised the question of who could have reported the rumours to the inquisitor in the first place. On 6 March, Carboni interviewed Morisi again and pointed out the inconsistencies between her story and the testimony of the Mortara family doctor, the Mortaras themselves, and both Lepori and Bussolari. She replied: "It's the Gospel truth". Carboni put it to Morisi that she might have invented the whole story out of spite against the Mortara family in the hope that the Church might reward her. When Carboni asked Morisi if she had been to San Domenico apart from for her interrogation, she stated that she had been there on two other occasions to try to secure a dowry from Father Feletti. Carboni suggested that Morisi must have herself prompted the interrogation by recounting Edgardo's baptism during one of these visits—Morisi insisted that the interrogation had been first and the other two visits later.

After one last interview with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni informed him that so far as he could see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion ... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".

Feletti faced a court trial under the code of laws in effect in Bologna at the time of Edgardo's kidnapping. Carboni proposed that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child kidnapped. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.

The hearing before a panel of six judges on 16 April 1860 was attended by neither the Mortara family nor Feletti—the former because they were in Turin and learned of the trial date only two days beforehand, and the latter because he refused to recognise the new authorities' right to put him on trial. With the evidence gathered by Curletti and Carboni already in hand, the prosecution had no witnesses to call. The prosecutor Radamisto Valentini, a lawyer fighting his first major case, declared that Feletti had ordered the kidnapping alone and on his own initiative, and then turned his focus to Carboni's second point of how the authorities in Rome could have possibly concluded that Morisi's story was genuine. Valentini went over Morisi's account in detail, arguing that even if things had happened as she said, the baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid. He then highlighted the inconsistencies between her testimony and the other accounts, condemned Morisi as a silly girl "corrupted by the foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers ... [who] rolled over without shame with them", and finally charged that Feletti had ordered the kidnapping himself out of <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a> and "an inquisitor's hatred of Judaism".

Jussi found himself in the unusual position of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.

The judging panel, headed by Calcedonio Ferrari, ruled following a swift deliberation that Feletti should be released as he had acted under instructions from the government of the time. The interval between the priest's arrest and his trial, coupled with the swift progress being made towards Italian unification, meant that the Mortara case had lost much of its prominence, so there was little protest against the decision. The Jewish press expressed disappointment—an editorial in the Italian Jewish paper "L'Educatore israelitico" suggested that it had perhaps been unwise to target Feletti rather than someone more senior. In France "Archives Israélites" took a similar line, positing: "what good does it do to strike at the arm when it is the head that in this case conceived, carried out, and sanctioned the attack?"

The Mortaras were not surprised by the verdict in Feletti's trial. Momolo hoped that his son might be a major topic of discussion at an international conference on the future of Italy, but was disappointed when no such summit materialised. His cause and visit to Paris partly motivated the formation in May 1860 of the <a href="Alliance%20Isra%C3%A9lite%20Universelle">Alliance Israélite Universelle</a>, a Paris-based organisation dedicated to the advancement of Jewish civil rights across the world. As the Italian nationalist armies advanced through the peninsula, the fall of Rome seemed imminent. In September 1860 the Alliance Israélite Universelle wrote to Momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force, as "getting your child back is the cause of all Israel". A separate plan was formulated by Carl Blumenthal, an English Jew serving in <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>'s nationalist volunteer corps: Blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen, seize Edgardo and spirit him away. Garibaldi approved this plan in 1860, but it was apparently called off after one of the conspirators died.

The Pope remained steadfastly determined not to give Edgardo up, declaring: "What I have done for this boy, I had the right and the duty to do. If it happened again, I would do the same thing." When the delegation from Rome's Jewish community attended their annual meeting at the Vatican in January 1861, they were surprised to find the nine year-old Edgardo at the pontiff's side. The new <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> was proclaimed a month later with Victor Emmanuel II as king. A reduced incarnation of the Papal States, comprising Rome and its immediate environs, endured outside the new kingdom because of Napoleon III's reluctance to offend his Catholic subjects by withdrawing the French garrison. He pulled these troops out in 1864 following the transport to the Catechumens of another Jewish child, nine-year-old Giuseppe Coen from the Roman Ghetto. The removal of the French garrison brought the <a href="Roman%20Question">Roman Question</a> to the fore in the Italian parliament. The statesman <a href="Marco%20Minghetti">Marco Minghetti</a> dismissed a proposed compromise whereby Rome would become part of the kingdom with the Pope retaining some special powers, saying: "We cannot go to guard the Mortara boy for the Pope." The French garrison returned in 1867, following an unsuccessful attempt by Garibaldi to capture the city.

In early 1865, at the age of 13, Edgardo became a novice in the <a href="Canons%20Regular%20of%20the%20Lateran">Canons Regular of the Lateran</a>, adding the Pope's name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote repeatedly to his family, he recalled, "dealing with religion and doing what I could to convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith," but received no reply until May 1867 – his parents, who were now living in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> broke out. Italian troops <a href="Capture%20of%20Rome">captured the city</a> on 20 September 1870.

Momolo Mortara followed the <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian Army</a> into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he was preceded by his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his hand in front of him and shouted: "Get back, Satan!" When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: "Before you get any closer to me, take off that assassin's uniform." Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome . . . they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [then] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General <a href="Alfonso%20Ferrero%20La%20Marmora">Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora</a>, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.

Edgardo found shelter in a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, where he lived under an assumed name. In 1872 he moved to a monastery at <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> in France, where Pope Pius regularly corresponded with <a href="Louis-%C3%89douard-Fran%C3%A7ois-Desir%C3%A9%20Pie">the bishop</a> about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was <a href="Ordination">ordained</a> as a priest – with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, as well as a lifetime trust fund of 7,000 <a href="Italian%20lira">lire</a> to support him.

Father Mortara spent most of the rest of his life outside Italy, travelling throughout Europe and preaching. It was said that he could give sermons in six languages, including <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, and read three more, including Hebrew. "As a preacher he was in great demand," Kertzer writes, "not least because of the inspirational way he was able to weave the remarkable story of his own childhood into his sermons. As he recounted it, his saga was the stuff of faith and hope: A story of how God chose a simple, illiterate servant girl to invest a small child with the miraculous powers of divine grace, and in doing so rescued him from his Jewish family – good people but, as Jews, on a God-forsaken path."

Momolo Mortara died in 1871, shortly after spending seven months in prison during his trial over the death of a servant girl who had fallen from the window of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to <a href="Perpignan">Perpignan</a> in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.

Following Marianna's death in 1890, it was reported in French newspapers that she had finally, on her deathbed and with Edgardo beside her, become a Christian. Edgardo refuted this: "I have always ardently desired that my mother embrace the Catholic faith," he wrote in a letter to "Le Temps", "and I tried many times to get her to do so. However, that never happened". A year later, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara returned to Italy for the first time in two decades to preach in Modena. A sister and some of his brothers came out to hear his sermon, and for the rest of his life Edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in Italy. During a 1919 sojourn in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61 years before. By this time he had settled at the abbey of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>, Belgium. Bouhay had a sanctuary to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a special connection, the <a href="Lourdes%20apparitions">Lourdes apparitions</a> of 1858 having occurred in the same year as his own conversion to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara resided at Bouhay for the rest of his life and died there on 11 March 1940, at the age of 88.

The Mortara case is given little attention in most Risorgimento histories, if it is mentioned at all.
The first book-length scholarly work was Rabbi <a href="Bertram%20Korn">Bertram Korn</a>'s "The American Reaction to the Mortara Case: 1858–1859" (1957), which was devoted entirely to public opinion in the United States and, according to Kertzer, often incorrect about details of the case. The main historical reference until the 1990s was a series of articles written by the Italian scholar Gemma Volli and published around the centenary of the controversy in 1958–60. When David Kertzer began studying the case he was surprised to find that many of his Italian colleagues were not familiar with it, while specialists in Jewish studies across the world invariably were—Mortara had, as Kertzer put it, "[fallen] from the mainstream of Italian history into the ghetto of Jewish history". Kertzer explored many sources not previously studied and eventually published "The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara" (1997), which has become the standard reference work for the affair.

The Mortara case was, in the view of Timothy Verhoeven, the greatest controversy to surround the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, as it "more than any other single issue . . . exposed the divide between supporters and opponents of the Vatican". Abigail Green writes that "this clash between liberal and Catholic worldviews at a moment of critical international tension ... gave the Mortara affair global significance—and rendered it a transformative episode in the Jewish world as well". Mortara himself suggested in 1893 that his abduction had been, for a time, "more famous than that of the <a href="The%20Rape%20of%20the%20Sabine%20Women">Sabine Women</a>".

In the months before Pius IX's <a href="beatification">beatification</a> by the Catholic Church in 2000, Jewish commentators and others in the international media raised the largely forgotten Mortara episode while analysing the Pope's life and legacy. According to Dov Levitan, the basic facts of the Mortara case are far from unique, but it is nevertheless of particular importance because of its effect on public opinion in Italy, Britain and France, and as an example of "the great sense of Jewish solidarity that emerged in the latter half of the 19th century [as] Jews rose to the cause of their brethren in various parts of the world". The "Alliance Israélite Universelle", whose formation had been partly motivated by the Mortara case, grew into one of the most prominent Jewish organisations in the world and endures into the 21st century. The case is the subject of <a href="Francesco%20Cilluffo">Francesco Cilluffo</a>'s two-act opera "<a href="Il%20caso%20Mortara">Il caso Mortara</a>", which premiered in New York in 2010. The <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>-language publication by <a href="Vittorio%20Messori">Vittorio Messori</a> in 2005 of Mortara's unpublished <a href="Castilian%20language">Castilian</a> memoirs, available in English since 2017 under the title "Kidnapped by the Vatican? The Unpublished Memoirs of Edgardo Mortara", reignited the debate anew.

According to <a href="Michael%20Goldfarb%20%28author%20and%20journalist%29">Michael Goldfarb</a>, the Mortara controversy provided "an embarrassing example of just how out of touch with modern times the Church was", and demonstrated that "Pope Pius IX was incapable of bringing the Church into the modern era". Kertzer takes a similar line: "The refusal to return Edgardo contributed to the growing sense that the Pope's role as temporal ruler, with his own police force, was an anachronism that could no longer be maintained." Kertzer goes so far as to suggest that as a primary motivator for the French change of stance that precipitated Italian unification in 1859–61, this "story of an illiterate servant girl, a grocer, and a little Jewish child from Bologna" may well have changed the course of both Italian and Church history.

Maus

Maus is a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish Jew</a> and <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor. The work employs <a href="postmodernism">postmodernist</a> techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. Critics have classified "Maus" as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres. In 1992, it became the first graphic novel to win a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> (the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20Special%20Citations%20and%20Awards">Special Award in Letters</a>).

In the <a href="Frame%20story">frame-tale</a> timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material for the "Maus" project he is preparing. In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> to his parents' liberation from the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>. Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman's troubled relationship with his father, and the absence of his mother, who committed suicide when he was 20. Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>. The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.

A three-page strip also called "Maus" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War II. The recorded interviews became the basis for the graphic novel, which Spiegelman began in 1978. He serialized "Maus" from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in "<a href="Raw%20%28magazine%29">Raw</a>", an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20Mouly">Françoise Mouly</a>, who also appears in "Maus". A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986 brought the book mainstream attention; a second volume collected the remaining chapters in 1991. "Maus" was one of the first graphic novels to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.

Most of the book weaves in and out of two timelines. In the <a href="Frame%20story">frame tale</a> of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the <a href="Rego%20Park%2C%20Queens">Rego Park</a> neighborhood of New York City in 1978–79. The story that Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s and continues until the end of <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> in 1945.

In Rego Park in 1958, a young Art Spiegelman complains to his father that his friends have left him behind. His father responds in broken English, "Friends? Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you could see what it is, friends!"

As an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged. Vladek has remarried to a woman called Mala since the suicide in 1968 of Art's mother Anja. Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences. Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city of <a href="Cz%C4%99stochowa">Częstochowa</a> and how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to <a href="Sosnowiec">Sosnowiec</a> to become a manufacturer. Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book and Art reluctantly agrees. Anja suffers a breakdown due to <a href="postpartum%20depression">postpartum depression</a> after giving birth to their first son Richieu, and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover. After they return, political and <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> tensions build until Vladek is <a href="Conscription">drafted</a> just before the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Nazi invasion</a>. Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a>. After his release, he finds Germany has <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">annexed Sosnowiec</a> and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the <a href="General%20Government">German protectorate</a>. He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.

During one of Art's visits, he finds that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the <a href="underground%20comix">underground comix</a> magazines Art contributed to. Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. In "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the <a href="Psychiatric%20hospital">mental hospital</a>, and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying, "You "murdered" me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!" Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.

In 1943, the Nazis move the Jews of the <a href="Sosnowiec%20Ghetto">Sosnowiec Ghetto</a> to Srodula and march them back to Sosnowiec to work. The family splits up—Vladek and Anja send Richieu to <a href="Zawiercie">Zawiercie</a> to stay with an aunt for safety. As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children and Richieu to escape the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>. In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans. Vladek's bunker is discovered and he is placed into a "ghetto inside the ghetto" surrounded by <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>. The remnants of Vladek and Anja's family are taken away. Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker. When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.

In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, but it is a trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) and take them to <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>, where they are separated until after the war.

Art asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read. Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself. Art is enraged and calls Vladek a "murderer".

The story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of "Maus" have appeared in a collected edition. Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives and finds himself "totally blocked". Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor. Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, "maybe it's better not to have any more stories". Art replies with a quote from <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>: "Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness", but then realizes, "on the other hand, he "said" it".

Vladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the —the process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution. Despite the danger, Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages. As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to <a href="Gross-Rosen%20concentration%20camp">Gross-Rosen</a> within the Reich and then to <a href="Dachau%20concentration%20camp">Dachau</a>, where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches <a href="typhus">typhus</a>.

The war ends, the camp survivors are freed and Vladek and Anja reunite. The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, "I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now." The final image is of Vladek and Anja's tombstone—Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.

Art Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman. An aunt poisoned their first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis four years before Spiegelman's birth. He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951. During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.

Spiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16. He spent a month in <a href="New%20York%20State%20Inebriate%20Asylum">Binghamton State Mental Hospital</a> in 1968 after a <a href="Mental%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>. Shortly after he got out, his mother committed suicide. Spiegelman's father was not happy with his son's involvement in the <a href="hippie">hippie</a> subculture. Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> it damaged their already-strained relationship "beyond repair". Around this time, Spiegelman read in <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s about such graphic artists as <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a> who had made <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a>s. The discussions in those fanzines about making the <a href="Great%20American%20Novel">Great American Novel</a> in comics inspired him.

Spiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor. In 1972 <a href="Justin%20Green%20%28cartoonist%29">Justin Green</a> produced the semi-autobiographical comic book "<a href="Binky%20Brown%20Meets%20the%20Holy%20Virgin%20Mary">Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary</a>", which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work. The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for the first issue of "Funny " , which Green edited. Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans, with cats as <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> members chasing African-American mice. Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled "Maus". The tale was narrated to a mouse named "<a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey</a>". After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience. His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest. Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer "Maus". Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived. He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.

In 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for "Short Order Comix" #1 about his mother's suicide called "Prisoner on the Hell Planet". The same year, he edited a <a href="Pornography">pornographic</a>, <a href="Psychedelia">psychedelic</a> book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother. He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> comics. He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a "very long comic book". He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978, and visited Auschwitz in 1979. He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called "Raw".

<a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a>s were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s. By the time "Maus" began serialization, the "Big Two" comics publishers, <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel</a> and <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>, dominated the industry with mostly <a href="superhero">superhero</a> titles. The <a href="underground%20comix">underground comix</a> movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund. The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression. Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.

"Maus" came to prominence when the term "<a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>" was beginning to gain currency. <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of "<a href="A%20Contract%20with%20God">A Contract with God</a>". The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term "comic book" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.

The first chapter of "Maus" appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of "Raw" as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991. Every chapter but the last appeared in "Raw".

Spiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of "Maus", but after a rave "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" review of the serial in August 1986, <a href="Pantheon%20Books">Pantheon Books</a> published the first six chapters in a volume called "Maus: A Survivor's Tale" and subtitled "My Father Bleeds History". Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film "<a href="An%20American%20Tail">An American Tail</a>" by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <a href="Amblin%20Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a>, was inspired by "Maus" and wished to avoid comparisons with it.

The book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the <a href="direct%20market">direct market</a> comic shops where comic books were normally sold. "Maus" was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it. Though Pantheon pushed for the term "graphic novel", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as "graphic novels" whether or not they had novelistic qualities. He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books. Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a> publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the <a href="Book%20Industry%20Study%20Group">Book Industry Study Group</a> in the early 2000s to include "graphic novel" as a category in bookstores.

Pantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled "And Here My Troubles Began". Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions. In 1994 the <a href="Voyager%20Company">Voyager Company</a> released "The Complete Maus" on <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>, a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material. The CD-ROM was based on <a href="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>, a <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>-only application that has since become obsolete. In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to "The Complete Maus" entitled "<a href="MetaMaus">MetaMaus</a>", with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek. The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute. It also has interviews with Spiegelman's wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of "Maus".

Spiegelman dedicated "Maus" to his brother Richieu and his first daughter <a href="Nadja%20Spiegelman">Nadja</a>. The book's <a href="epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraph</a> is a quote from <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>: "The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human."

<a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> in 1986. In support of the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a>'s cultural boycott in opposition to <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, Spiegelman refused to "compromise with fascism" by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.

By 2011, "Maus" had been translated into about thirty languages. Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">Franco-Belgian comics</a> tradition; German, given the book's background; and <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>. Poland was the setting for most of the book and Polish was the language of his parents and his own <a href="First%20language">mother tongue</a>. The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per <a href="Strafgesetzbuch%20section%2086a">laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism</a>. Reception in Germany was positive—"Maus" was a best-seller and was taught in schools. The Polish translation encountered difficulties; as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs and pointed out how serious an insult it was. Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts. <a href="Piotr%20Bikont">Piotr Bikont</a>, a journalist for , set up his own publishing house to publish "Maus" in Polish in 2001. Demonstrators protested "Maus"s publication and burned the book in front of "Gazeta"s offices. Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows. The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages. Long-standing plans for an <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> translation have yet to come to fruition. A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of "Maus" from Russian bookstores leading up to <a href="Victory%20Day%20%289%20May%29">Victory Day</a> due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.

A few panels were changed for the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> edition of "Maus". Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police. An <a href="Israelis">Israeli</a> descendant objected and threatened to sue for <a href="Defamation">libel</a>. Spiegelman redrew the character with a <a href="fedora">fedora</a> in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this "intrusion". This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house <a href="Kinneret%20Zmora-Bitan%20Dvir">Zmora Bitan</a>. It had an indifferent or negative reception, and the publisher did not release the second volume. Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes, with a new translation by poet <a href="Yehuda%20Vizan">Yehuda Vizan</a> that included Vladek's broken language, which Zmora Bitan had refused to do. Marilyn Reizbaum saw this as highlighting a difference between the self-image of the Israeli Jew as a fearless defender of the homeland, and that of the American Jew as a feeble victim, something that one Israeli writer disparaged as "the diaspora sickness".

Spiegelman, like many of his critics, worries that "[r]eality is too much for comics ... so much has to be left out or distorted", admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate. He takes a <a href="Postmodernism">postmodern</a> approach; "Maus" "feeds on itself", telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make—for example, when his French wife <a href="Conversion%20to%20Judaism">converts to Judaism</a>, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.

The book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs, among others. Spiegelman took advantage of the way <a href="Nazi%20propaganda%20films">Nazi propaganda films</a> depicted Jews as vermin, though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where <a href="Ken%20Jacobs">Ken Jacobs</a> showed films of <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel show</a>s along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures. Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: "Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed ... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal ... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!"

Jewish characters try to <a href="Passing%20%28racial%20identity%29">pass themselves off</a> as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's—"you could see she was more Jewish", Vladek says. Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a> may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. According to art historian <a href="Andrea%20Liss">Andrea Liss</a>, this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.

In making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines. Spiegelman has stated that "these metaphors ... are meant to self-destruct" and "reveal the inanity of the notion itself". Professor <a href="Amy%20Hungerford">Amy Hungerford</a> saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor. Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races—the <a href="gentile">gentile</a> Françoise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims. When asked what animal he would make <a href="Israeli%20Jews">Israeli Jews</a>, Spiegelman suggests <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a>s. When Art visits his <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>, the two wear mouse masks. Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making—in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask. In "Maus", the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans. Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.

To <a href="Marianne%20Hirsch">Marianne Hirsch</a>, Spiegelman's life is "dominated by memories that are not his own". His work is one not of memory but of "postmemory"—a term she coined after encountering "Maus". This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves. While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. The children's proximity creates a "deep personal connection" with the memory, though separated from it by "generational distance".

Art tried to keep his father's story chronological, because otherwise he would "never keep it straight". His mother Anja's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide and Vladek's destruction of her diaries. Hirsch sees "Maus" in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory. Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, "like a shrine", according to Mala.

Spiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways. He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to. The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses—the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom "Maus" success was built. He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son, and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way. As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this "separate universe", and feels inadequate in portraying it.

Spiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a "<a href="List%20of%20ethnic%20slurs%23S">schwartser</a>" as he says. When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, "It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!" Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.

The Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story. Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers; some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as police for the Nazis.

Spiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The <a href="kapo%20%28concentration%20camp%29">kapo</a>s who run the camps are Poles, and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis. Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.

Vladek's English is broken in contrast with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor. Vladek's knowledge of the language helps him several times during the story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never in his mother tongue, and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America. His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English; when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, "[E]very day we prayed ... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do". Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, "And here ... my troubles began", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau. This unidiomatic expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume.

The German word "Maus" is <a href="cognate">cognate</a> to the English word "mouse", and also reminiscent of the German verb "mauscheln", which means "to speak like a Jew" and refers to the way Jews from <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> spoke German—a word not <a href="Etymology">etymologically</a> related to "Maus", but distantly to "<a href="Moses">Moses</a>".

Spiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics. The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial, thus degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones. <a href="Funny%20animal">Funny animal</a>s have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children's fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories, for example in <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a>'s <a href="Fritz%20the%20Cat">Fritz the Cat</a>, which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could "open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism" that "Maus" exploited.

Ostensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father. Art's "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematical contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form in a <a href="Surrealism">surreal</a>, <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> style inspired by <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a>.

Spiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what "Maus" is becoming for him, he says to his wife, "In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting." When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".

Spiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder, face-to-face or over the phone. Spiegelman often condensed Vladek's words, and occasionally added to the dialogue or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.

Spiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek's story would have on its authenticity. In the end, he eschewed a <a href="Joycean">Joycean</a> approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at "getting things across". He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the "sense of an interview shaped by a relationship".

The story is text-driven, with few wordless <a href="Panel%20%28comics%29">panels</a> in its 1,500 black-and-white panels. The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins. There is little gray in the shading. In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself "violating the grid constantly" with his page layouts.

Spiegelman rendered the original three-page "Maus" and "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" in highly detailed, expressive styles. Spiegelman planned to draw "Maus" in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think". He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.

Spiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on <a href="stationery">stationery</a> with a fountain pen and typewriter <a href="correction%20fluid">correction fluid</a>. It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.

Spiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history. Chief among his early influences were <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>, Will Eisner, and <a href="Bernard%20Krigstein">Bernard Krigstein</a>'s "<a href="Impact%20%28EC%20Comics%29%23Master%20Race">Master Race</a>". Though he acknowledged Eisner's early work as an influence, he denied that Eisner's first graphic novel, "<a href="A%20Contract%20with%20God">A Contract with God</a>" (1978), had any impact on "Maus". He cited <a href="Harold%20Gray">Harold Gray</a>'s comic strip "<a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie">Little Orphan Annie</a>" as having "influenced "Maus" fairly directly", and praised Gray's work for using a cartoon-based storytelling vocabulary, rather than an illustration-based one. Justin Green's "<a href="Binky%20Brown%20Meets%20the%20Holy%20Virgin%20Mary">Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary</a>" (1972) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics. Spiegelman stated, "without "Binky Brown", there would be no "Maus"". Among the graphic artists who influenced "Maus", Spiegelman cited <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a>, who had made early <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a>s in <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s such as "<a href="Passionate%20Journey">Passionate Journey</a>" (1919).

Spiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected. Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and "Maus" became the center of new attention focused on comics. It was considered one of the "Big Three" book-form comics from around 1986–1987, along with "<a href="Watchmen">Watchmen</a>" and "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>", that are said to have brought the term "graphic novel" and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness. It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes. Initially, critics of "Maus" showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse. "The New York Times" intended praise when saying of the book, "Art Spiegelman doesn't draw comic books". After its <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics. The <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> staged an exhibition on the making of "Maus" in 1991–92.

"Maus" proved difficult to classify to a genre, and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir. Spiegelman petitioned "The New York Times" to move it from "fiction" to "non-fiction" on the newspaper's bestseller list, saying, "I shudder to think how <a href="David%20Duke">David Duke</a> ... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction". An editor responded, "Let's go out to Spiegelman's house and if a giant mouse answers the door, we'll move it to the nonfiction side of the list!" The "Times" eventually acquiesced. The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed "Maus" a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20Special%20Citations%20and%20Awards">Special Award in Letters</a> in 1992.

"Maus" ranked highly on comics and literature lists. "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>" called it the fourth greatest comics work of the 20th century, and "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" placed it first on their list of 100 Greatest Graphic Novels. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" listed "Maus" at seventh place on their list of "The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008", and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" put "Maus" at seventh place on their list of best non-fiction books from between 1923 and 2005, and fourth on their list of top graphic novels. Praise for the book also came from contemporaries such as <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a> and literary writers such as <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a>. Spiegelman turned down numerous offers to have "Maus" adapted for film or television.

Early installments of "Maus" that appeared in "Raw" inspired the young <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a> to "try to do comics that had a 'serious' tone to them". "Maus" is cited as a primary influence on graphic novels such as <a href="Marjane%20Satrapi">Marjane Satrapi</a>'s "<a href="Persepolis%20%28comics%29">Persepolis</a>" and <a href="Alison%20Bechdel">Alison Bechdel</a>'s "<a href="Fun%20Home">Fun Home</a>".

In 1999, cartoonist <a href="Ted%20Rall">Ted Rall</a> had an article published in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" criticizing Spiegelman's prominence and influence in the New York cartooning community. Entitled "King "Maus": Art Spiegelman Rules the World of Comix With Favors and Fear", it accused the Pulitzer board of opportunism in selecting "Maus", which Rall deemed unworthy. Cartoonist <a href="Danny%20Hellman">Danny Hellman</a> responded to the piece with a prank email in which Hellman posed as Rall, soliciting discussion at the email address TedRallsBalls@onelist.com. Hellman followed up by posting fake responses from New York magazine editors and art directors. Rall launched a lawsuit seeking damages of $1.5 million for libel, breach of privacy, and causing emotional distress. To raise funds to fight the suit, in 2001 Hellman had the "Legal Action Comics" anthology published, which included a back cover by Spiegelman in which he depicts Rall as a urinal.

A cottage industry of academic research has built up around "Maus", and schools have frequently used it as course material in a range of fields: history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. The volume of academic work published on "Maus" far surpasses that of any other work of comics. One of the earliest such works was <a href="Joshua%20Brown%20%28historian%29">Joshua Brown</a>'s 1988 "Of Mice and Memory" from the "<a href="Oral%20History%20Association">Oral History Review</a>", which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father's story. Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called "Family Pictures: "Maus", Mourning, and Post-Memory", later expanded into a book called "Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory". Academics far outside the field of comics such as <a href="Dominick%20LaCapra">Dominick LaCapra</a>, <a href="Linda%20Hutcheon">Linda Hutcheon</a>, and <a href="Terrence%20Des%20Pres">Terrence Des Pres</a> took part in the discourse. Few approached "Maus" who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition—"Maus" tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on "Maus" called "Considering "Maus": Approaches to Art Spiegelman's "Survivor's Tale" of the Holocaust". "Maus" is considered an important work of <a href="Holocaust%20literature">Holocaust literature</a>, and studies of it have made significant contributions to <a href="Holocaust%20Studies%20and%20Materials">Holocaust studies</a>.

According to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy. Literary critics such as <a href="Hillel%20Halkin">Hillel Halkin</a> objected that the animal metaphor was "doubly dehumanizing", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans. Comics writer and critic <a href="Harvey%20Pekar">Harvey Pekar</a> and others saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes. Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father, calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective. Comics critic <a href="R.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Harvey">R. C. Harvey</a> argued that Spiegelman's animal metaphor threatened "to erode moral underpinnings", and played "directly into racist vision".

Commentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence Weschler expressed concern over the Poles' depiction as pigs, which reviewer <a href="Marek%20Kohn">Marek Kohn</a> saw as an ethnic slur and "The Norton Anthology of American Literature" called "a calculated insult". Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non-<a href="Kashrut">kosher</a>, or "unclean"—a point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant. Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalanced—that, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons. In the late 1990s, an objector to "Maus"s depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal's <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> with persistent abuse and was expelled from the auditorium.

Literary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman's racial divisions "counterfactual". Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, both black and white, as dogs—with the exception of the Jews, who remain unassimilated mice. To Michaels, "Maus" seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.

Other critics, such as Bart Beaty, objected to what they saw as the work's fatalism.

Scholar Paul Buhle asserted, "More than a few readers have described as the most compelling of any depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason." Michael Rothberg opined, "By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, 'comic' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz."

Belgian publisher La Cinquième Couche anonymously produced a book called "Katz", a remix of Spiegelman's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads. The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of "Maus". Spiegelman's French publisher, <a href="Groupe%20Flammarion">Flammarion</a>, had the Belgian publisher destroy all copies under charges of <a href="Copyright%20infringement">copyright violation</a>.

John Millington Synge

Edmund John Millington Synge (; 16 April 1871 – 24 March 1909) was an Irish playwright, poet, <a href="prose">prose</a> writer, travel writer and collector of <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. He was a key figure in the <a href="Celtic%20Revival">Irish Literary Revival</a> and was one of the co-founders of the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>. He is best known for his play "<a href="The%20Playboy%20of%20the%20Western%20World">The Playboy of the Western World</a>", which caused riots in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> during its opening run at the Abbey Theatre.

Although he came from a privileged <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> background, Synge's writings are mainly concerned with the world of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> peasants of rural Ireland and with what he saw as the essential <a href="paganism">paganism</a> of their world view. Synge developed <a href="Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma">Hodgkin's disease</a>, a <a href="metastatic%20cancer">metastatic cancer</a> that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, "<a href="Deirdre%20of%20the%20Sorrows">Deirdre of the Sorrows</a>".

Synge was born in Newtown Villas, <a href="Rathfarnham">Rathfarnham</a>, <a href="County%20Dublin">County Dublin</a>, on 16 April 1871. He was the youngest son in a family of eight children. His parents were members of the <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Ireland">Protestant</a> <a href="upper%20middle%20class">upper middle class</a>. his father, John Hatch Synge, who was a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, came from a family of <a href="landed%20gentry">landed gentry</a> in Glanmore Castle, <a href="County%20Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>. He was the uncle of brothers, mathematician <a href="John%20Lighton%20Synge">John Lighton Synge</a> and optical microscopy pioneer <a href="Edward%20Hutchinson%20Synge">Edward Hutchinson Synge</a>. Synge's paternal grandfather, also named John Synge, was an evangelical Christian involved in the movement that became the <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a> and his maternal grandfather, <a href="Robert%20Traill%20%28clergyman%29">Robert Traill</a>, had been a <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> in <a href="Schull">Schull, County Cork</a>, who died in 1847 during the <a href="Great%20Irish%20Famine">Great Irish Famine</a>.

Synge's father contracted <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and died in 1872 at the age of 49. He was buried on his son's first birthday. Synge's mother moved the family to the house next door to her mother's house in <a href="Rathgar">Rathgar</a>, County Dublin. Synge, although often ill, had a happy childhood there. He developed an interest in bird-watching along the banks of the <a href="River%20Dodder">River Dodder</a> and during family holidays at the seaside resort of <a href="Greystones">Greystones</a>, County Wicklow, and the family estate at Glanmore.

Synge was educated privately at schools in Dublin and <a href="Bray%2C%20County%20Wicklow">Bray</a>, and later studied piano, flute, violin, <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> and <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Irish Academy of Music</a>. He travelled to the continent to study music, but changed his mind and decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now <a href="D%C3%BAn%20Laoghaire">Dún Laoghaire</a>) in 1888, and Synge entered <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, the following year. He graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">BA</a> in 1892, having studied <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> and <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, as well as continuing his music studies and playing with the Academy Orchestra in the Antient Concert Rooms. Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music lessons with <a href="Robert%20Prescott%20Stewart">Robert Prescott Stewart</a>.

Synge joined the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club and read the works of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. He wrote: "When I was about fourteen I obtained a book of Darwin's ... My studies showed me the force of what I read, [and] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power ... Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." He then continued, "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began to take up a real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round ... to a temperate Nationalism."

Synge later developed an interest in Irish antiquities and the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a>, and became a member of the <a href="Maud%20Gonne%23Early%20career">Irish League</a> for a year. He left the League because, as he told <a href="Maud%20Gonne">Maud Gonne</a>, "my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours ... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and I shall never be able to do so if I get mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement." In 1893 he published his first known work, a poem influenced by <a href="William%20Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a>, "Kottabos: A College Miscellany".

After graduating, Synge decided that he wanted to be a professional musician and went to <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> to study music. He stayed in <a href="Koblenz">Coblenz</a> during 1893 and moved to <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a> in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, and partly because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a>.

During summer holidays with his family in Dublin he met and fell in love with Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.

In 1896 Synge visited Italy to study the language for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>, who encouraged him to live for a while in the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a>, and then return to Dublin and devote himself to creative work. That year he joined with Yeats, <a href="Augusta%2C%20Lady%20Gregory">Augusta, Lady Gregory</a>, and <a href="George%20William%20Russell">George William Russell</a> to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's "Irlande Libre" and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent "<a href="fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle">fin de siècle</a>" style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his "Collected Works".) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar <a href="Marie%20Henri%20d%27Arbois%20de%20Jubainville">Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville</a>.

In 1897 Synge had his first attack of Hodgkin's disease and also had an enlarged gland removed from his neck. The following year he spent the summer in the Aran Islands. He spent the next five summers in the Aran Islands, collecting stories and folklore, and perfecting his Irish, while continuing to live in Paris for most of the rest of each year. He also visited <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> regularly. During this period he wrote his first play, "When the Moon Has Set" and sent it to Lady Gregory for the <a href="Irish%20Literary%20Theatre">Irish Literary Theatre</a> in 1900, but she rejected it. (The play was not published until it appeared in the "Collected Works".)

Synge's first account of life in the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a> was published in the "New Ireland Review" in 1898 and his book, "", based largely on journals, was completed in 1901 and published in 1907 with illustrations by <a href="Jack%20Butler%20Yeats">Jack Butler Yeats</a>. Synge considered the book "my first serious piece of work". When Lady Gregory read the manuscript she advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he refused to do either because he wanted to create something more realistic. The book expresses Synge's belief that beneath the <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> of the islanders it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors. His experiences in the Aran Islands were to form the basis for the plays about Irish rural life that Synge went on to write.
In 1903 Synge left Paris and moved to London. He had written two one-act plays, "<a href="Riders%20to%20the%20Sea">Riders to the Sea</a>" and "The Shadow of the Glen", the previous year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and "The Shadow of the Glen" was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. "<a href="Riders%20to%20the%20Sea">Riders to the Sea</a>" was performed at the same venue in February the following year. "The Shadow of the Glen", under the title "In the Shadow of the Glen", formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help set the stage for each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.

"The Shadow of the Glen", based on a story about an unfaithful wife, was attacked in print by the <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalist</a> leader <a href="Arthur%20Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a> as "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: "When I was writing "The Shadow of the Glen" some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. "<a href="Riders%20to%20the%20Sea">Riders to the Sea</a>" was also attacked by nationalists, this time including <a href="Patrick%20Pearse">Patrick Pearse</a>, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, <a href="Arthur%20Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a> and other conservative-minded <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, "The Tinker's Wedding", was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher <a href="Elkin%20Mathews">Elkin Mathews</a> in 1905, would probably upset "a good many of our Dublin friends".

When the Abbey Theatre was set up Synge was appointed literary adviser and soon became one of the directors, along with Yeats and <a href="Lady%20Gregory">Lady Gregory</a>. He differed from Yeats and Lady Gregory on what he believed the Irish theatre should be, as he wrote to <a href="Stephen%20MacKenna">Stephen MacKenna</a>:I do not believe in the possibility of "a purely fantastic, unmodern, ideal, breezy, spring-dayish, Cuchulainoid National Theatre" ... no drama can grow out of anything other than the fundamental realities of life, which are never fantastic, are neither modern nor unmodern and, as I see them, rarely spring-dayish, or breezy or Cuchulanoid.

Synge's next play, "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20the%20Saints">The Well of the Saints</a>", was staged at the Abbey in 1905, again to nationalist disapproval, and then in 1906 at the <a href="Deutsches%20Theater%20%28Berlin%29">Deutsches Theater</a> in Berlin. The critic Joseph Holloway claimed that the play combined "lyric and dirt".

The play widely regarded as Synge's masterpiece, "The Playboy of the Western World", was first performed at the Abbey Theatre on 26 January 1907. A comedy about apparent <a href="patricide">patricide</a>, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The "<a href="Freeman%27s%20Journal">Freeman's Journal</a>" described it as "an unmitigated, protracted <a href="libel">libel</a> upon Irish <a href="peasant">peasant</a> men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood". <a href="Arthur%20Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a>, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as "a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line "... a drift of chosen females, standing in their <a href="Chemise">shifts</a> ..."

At the time a shift was known as a symbol representing <a href="Katharine%20O%27Shea">Kitty O'Shea</a> and <a href="adultery">adultery</a>. A significant portion of the audience at the first performance rioted, causing the third act of the play to be acted out in <a href="dumbshow">dumbshow</a>. Riots continued at each of the scheduled performances that week. Yeats referred to this incident in a speech to the Abbey audience in 1926 on the fourth night of <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20O%27Casey">Seán O'Casey</a>'s "<a href="The%20Plough%20and%20the%20Stars">The Plough and the Stars</a>", when he declared: "You have disgraced yourselves again. Is this to be an ever-recurring celebration of the arrival of Irish genius? Synge first and then O'Casey?"

Although the writing of "The Tinker's Wedding" began at the same time as "Riders to the Sea" and "<a href="In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Glen">In the Shadow of the Glen</a>", it took Synge five years to complete, and was finished in 1907. "Riders" was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway 4–8 January 1907 and not performed again until 1909, and only then in <a href="London">London</a>. The first critic to respond to the play was <a href="Daniel%20Corkery%20%28author%29">Daniel Corkery</a>, who said, "One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere."

Synge died at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin on 24 March 1909, aged 37, and was buried in <a href="Mount%20Jerome%20Cemetery%20and%20Crematorium">Mount Jerome Cemetery</a>, <a href="Harold%27s%20Cross">Harold's Cross</a>, Dublin.

A collected volume, "Poems and Translations", with a preface by Yeats, was published by the <a href="Cuala%20Press">Cuala Press</a> on 8 April 1909. Yeats and actress and one-time fiancee Molly Allgood (<a href="Maire%20O%27Neill">Maire O'Neill</a>) completed Synge's unfinished final play, "Deirdre of the Sorrows", and it was presented by the Abbey players on Thursday 13 January 1910 with Allgood as Deirdre.

<a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>, who knew Synge, wrote that he "gave one from the first the impression of a strange personality". Masefield felt that Synge's view of life originated with his poor health. In particular, Masefield claimed that "His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does".

Yeats summarised his view of Synge in one of the stanzas of his poem "In Memory of Major Robert Gregory":

Synge's plays helped to set the dominant style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised <a href="Literary%20realism">realism</a> of his writing was reflected in the training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire until the end of the 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. <a href="Brendan%20Behan">Brendan Behan</a>, <a href="Brinsley%20MacNamara">Brinsley MacNamara</a>, and <a href="Lennox%20Robinson">Lennox Robinson</a> were all indebted to Synge.

Critic <a href="Vivian%20Mercier">Vivian Mercier</a> was among the first to recognise <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s debt to Synge. Beckett was a regular member of the audience at the Abbey in his youth and particularly admired the plays of Yeats, Synge and O'Casey. Mercier points out parallels between Synge's casts of tramps, beggars and peasants and many of the figures in Beckett's novels and dramatic works.

In recent years Synge's cottage in the Aran Islands has been restored as a tourist attraction. An annual Synge Summer School has been held every summer since 1991 in the village of <a href="Rathdrum%2C%20County%20Wicklow">Rathdrum, County Wicklow</a>. Synge is the subject of Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín's 1999 documentary film, "Synge agus an Domhan Thiar" ("Synge and the Western World"). <a href="Joseph%20O%27Connor">Joseph O'Connor</a> wrote a novel, "Ghost Light" (2010), loosely based on Synge's relationship with Molly Allgood.

Ruff

The ruff ("Calidris pugnax") is a medium-sized <a href="wader">wading bird</a> that breeds in <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es and wet <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s across northern <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. This highly <a href="gregarious">gregarious</a> <a href="Scolopacidae">sandpiper</a> is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> and sometimes forms huge flocks in its winter grounds, which include southern and western Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australia.

The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism%23Birds">sexual dimorphism</a>; the male is much larger than the female (the reeve), and has a breeding <a href="plumage">plumage</a> that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a <a href="lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a>, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four <a href="Bird%20egg">eggs</a> in a well-hidden ground <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a>, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s and <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, and birds such as large <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="corvidae">corvids</a> and <a href="skua">skua</a>s.

The ruff <a href="forage">forage</a>s in wet grassland and soft mud, probing or searching by sight for edible items. It primarily feeds on insects, especially in the breeding season, but it will consume plant material, including <a href="rice">rice</a> and maize, on migration and in winter. Classified as "<a href="Least%20Concern">least concern</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> criteria, the global <a href="bird%20conservation">conservation</a> concerns are relatively low because of the large numbers that breed in Scandinavia and the Arctic. However, the range in much of Europe is contracting because of land drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of mown or grazed breeding sites, and over-hunting. This decline has seen it listed in the "<a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>" (AEWA).

The ruff is a <a href="wader">wader</a> in the large family <a href="Scolopacidae">Scolopacidae</a>, the typical shorebirds. Recent research suggests that its closest relatives are the broad-billed sandpiper, "Calidris falcinellus", and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, "Calidris acuminata". It has no recognised subspecies or geographical variants.

This species was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 as "Tringa pugnax". It was moved into its current genus by <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Blasius%20Merrem">Blasius Merrem</a> in 1804. Both parts of the binomial name refer to the aggressive behaviour of the bird at its <a href="Lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">mating arenas</a>; "pugnax" from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> term for "combative".

The original English name for this bird, dating back to at least 1465, is the "ree", perhaps derived from a dialectical term meaning "frenzied"; a later name "reeve", which is still used for the female, is of unknown origin, but may be derived from the <a href="sheriff">shire-reeve</a>, a feudal officer, likening the male's flamboyant plumage to the official's robes. The current name was first recorded in 1634, and is derived from the <a href="ruff%20%28clothing%29">ruff</a>, an exaggerated collar fashionable from the mid-sixteenth century to the mid-seventeenth century, since the male bird's neck ornamental feathers resemble the neck-wear.

The ruff has a distinctive <a href="sauce%20boat">gravy boat</a> appearance, with a small head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals on the sides of the tail.
This species shows <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. Although a small percentage of males resemble females, the typical male is much larger than the female and has an elaborate breeding plumage. He is long with a wingspan, and weighs about . In the May-to-June breeding season, the typical male's legs, bill and warty bare facial skin are orange, and he has distinctive head tufts and a neck ruff. These ornaments vary on individual birds, being black, chestnut or white, with the colouring solid, barred or irregular. The grey-brown back has a scale-like pattern, often with black or chestnut feathers, and the underparts are white with extensive black on the breast. The extreme variability of the main breeding plumage is thought to have developed to aid individual recognition in a species that has communal breeding displays, but is usually mute.

Outside the breeding season, the typical male's head and neck decorations and the bare facial skin are lost and the legs and bill become duller. The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.

The female, or "reeve", is long with a wingspan, and weighs about . In breeding plumage, she has grey-brown upperparts with white-fringed, dark-centred feathers. The breast and flanks are variably blotched with black. In winter, her plumage is similar to that of the male, but the sexes are distinguishable on size. The plumage of the juvenile ruff resembles the non-breeding adult, but has upperparts with a neat, scale-like pattern with dark feather centres, and a strong buff tinge to the underparts.

Typical adult male ruffs start to <a href="moult">moult</a> into the main display plumage before their return to the breeding areas, and the proportion of birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.

Ruffs of both sexes have an additional moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the <a href="bar-tailed%20godwit">bar-tailed godwit</a>. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> pressures.

Adult males and most adult females start their pre-winter moult before returning south, but complete most feather replacement on the wintering grounds. In <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, males moult 3–4 weeks ahead of the females, finishing before December, whereas females typically complete feather replacement during December and early January. Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing and duration to that of the adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.

Two other waders can be confused with the ruff. The juvenile <a href="sharp-tailed%20sandpiper">sharp-tailed sandpiper</a> is a little smaller than a juvenile female ruff and has a similar rich orange-buff breast, but the ruff is slimmer with a longer neck and legs, a rounder head, and a much plainer face. The <a href="buff-breasted%20sandpiper">buff-breasted sandpiper</a> also resembles a small juvenile ruff, but even the female ruff is noticeably larger than the sandpiper, with a longer bill, more rotund body and scaly-patterned upperparts.

The ruff is a migratory species, breeding in wetlands in colder regions of northern Eurasia, and spends the northern winter in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>, mainly in Africa. Some Siberian breeders undertake an annual round trip of up to to the West African wintering grounds. There is a limited overlap of the summer and winter ranges in western Europe. The ruff breeds in extensive lowland freshwater marshes and damp grasslands. It avoids barren <a href="tundra">tundra</a> and areas badly affected by severe weather, preferring hummocky marshes and deltas with shallow water. The wetter areas provide a source of food, the mounds and slopes may be used for <a href="Lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">leks</a>, and dry areas with <a href="Cyperaceae">sedge</a> or low <a href="scrubland">scrub</a> offer nesting sites. A Hungarian study showed that moderately intensive grazing of grassland, with more than one cow per hectare (2.5 acres), was found to attract more nesting pairs. When not breeding, the birds use a wider range of shallow wetlands, such as <a href="irrigation">irrigated fields</a>, lake margins, and mining <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> and other floodlands. Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used. The density can reach 129 individuals per square kilometre (334 per square mile), but is usually much lower.

The ruff breeds in Europe and Asia from Scandinavia and Great Britain almost to the Pacific. In Europe it is found in cool temperate areas, but over its Russian range it is an Arctic species, occurring mainly north of about 65°N. The largest numbers breed in Russia (more than 1 million pairs), Sweden (61,000 pairs), Finland (39,000 pairs) and Norway (14,000 pairs). Although it also breeds from Britain east through the Low Countries to Poland, Germany and Denmark, there are fewer than 2,000 pairs in these more southerly areas.

It is highly gregarious on migration, travelling in large flocks that can contain hundreds or thousands of individuals. Huge dense groups form on the wintering grounds; one flock in <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> contained a million birds. A minority winter further east to Burma, south China, New Guinea and scattered parts of southern Australia, or on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical wintering quarters. The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand. It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, a major migration stopover area.

The male, which plays no part in nesting or chick care, leaves the breeding grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may also be able to tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.

Birds returning north in spring across the central Mediterranean appear to follow a well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular <a href="layover">stopover</a> sites to feed, and individuals marked with <a href="bird%20ringing">rings</a> or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s as the main energy source for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they <a href="Oxidation%23Redox%20reactions%20in%20biology">oxidise</a> lipids.

Males display during the breeding season at a <a href="lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a> in a traditional open grassy arena. The ruff is one of the few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">inherited</a> variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its <a href="gene">gene</a>s (see <a href="%23Biology%20of%20variation%20among%20males">§Biology of variation among males</a>).

The territorial males, about 84% of the total, have strongly coloured black or chestnut ruffs and stake out and occupy small mating territories in the lek. They actively court females and display a high degree of aggression towards other resident males; 5–20 territorial males each hold an area of the lek about across, usually with bare soil in the centre. They perform an elaborate display that includes wing fluttering, jumping, standing upright, crouching with ruff erect, or lunging at rivals. They are typically silent even when displaying, although a soft "gue-gue-gue" may occasionally be given.

<a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">Territorial</a> males are very site-faithful; 90% return to the same lekking sites in subsequent seasons, the most dominant males being the most likely to reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.

Satellite males, about 16% of the total number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories occupied by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.
Although satellite males are on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if provided with the same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they do not need to be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.

A third type of male was first described in 2006; this is a permanent female mimic, the first such reported for a bird. About 1% of males are small, intermediate in size between males and females, and do not grow the elaborate breeding plumage of the territorial and satellite males, although they have much larger internal <a href="testicle">testes</a> than the ruffed males. Although the males of most lekking bird species have relatively small testes for their size, male ruffs have the most disproportionately large testes of any bird.

This cryptic male, or "faeder" (<a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "father") obtains access to mating territories together with the females, and "steals" matings when the females crouch to solicit copulation. The faeder moults into the prenuptial male plumage with striped feathers, but does not go on to develop the ornamental feathers of the normal male. As described above, this stage is thought to show the original male breeding plumage, before other male types evolved. A faeder can be distinguished in the hand by its wing length, which is intermediate between those of displaying males and females. Despite their feminine appearance, the faeders migrate with the larger 'normal' lekking males and spend the winter with them.
The faeders are sometimes mounted by independent or satellite males, but are as often "on top" in <a href="homosexual%20behavior%20in%20animals">homosexual mountings</a> as the ruffed males, suggesting that their true identity is known by the other males. Females never mount males. Females often seem to prefer mating with faeders to copulation with normal males, and normal males also copulate with faeders (and "vice versa") relatively more often than with females. The homosexual copulations may attract females to the lek, like the presence of satellite males.

Not all mating takes place at the lek, since only a minority of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.

The level of <a href="polyandry">polyandry</a> in the ruff is the highest known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have clutches fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females mate with males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. In the absence of this cost, if polyandry is advantageous, it would be expected to occur at a higher rate in lekking than among pair-bonded species.

The nest is a shallow ground scrape lined with grass leaves and stems, and concealed in marsh plants or tall grass up to from the lek. Nesting is solitary, although several females may lay in the general vicinity of a lek. The eggs are slightly glossy, green or olive, and marked with dark blotches; they are laid from mid-March to early June depending on latitude.

The typical clutch is four eggs, each egg measuring in size and weighing of which 5% is shell. Incubation is by the female alone, and the time to hatching is 20–23 days, with a further 25–28 days to fledging. The <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks have buff and chestnut down, streaked and barred with black, and frosted with white; they feed themselves on a variety of small invertebrates, but are brooded by the female. One brood is raised each year.

Ruffs often show a pronounced inequality in the numbers of each sex. A study of juveniles in Finland found that only 34% were males and 1% were faeders. It appears that females produce a larger proportion of males at the egg stage when they are in poor physical condition. When females are in better condition, any bias in the sex ratio is smaller or absent.

Predators of waders breeding in wet grasslands include birds such as large gulls, <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>, <a href="Carrion%20crow">carrion</a> and <a href="hooded%20crow">hooded crow</a>s, and <a href="Great%20skua">great</a> and <a href="Arctic%20skua">Arctic skua</a>s; foxes occasionally take waders, and the impact of <a href="feral%20cats">feral cats</a> and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and <a href="torticollis">twisted neck syndrome</a>. Adults seem to show little evidence of <a href="parasitism">external parasites</a>, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including <a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a> in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>s; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in <a href="Friesland">Friesland</a> showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the <a href="life%20expectancy">average lifespan</a> for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.

The ruff normally feeds using a steady walk and pecking action, selecting food items by sight, but it will also wade deeply and submerge its head. On saline lakes in East Africa it often swims like a <a href="phalarope">phalarope</a>, picking items off the surface. It will feed at night as well as during the day. It is thought that Ruff use both visual and auditory cues to find prey. When feeding, the ruff frequently raises its back feathers, producing a loose pointed peak on the back; this habit is shared only by the black-tailed godwit.

During the breeding season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively of the adults and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies. On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including <a href="Trichoptera">caddis flies</a>, water-beetles, <a href="mayfly">mayflies</a> and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, flies and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.

Just before migration, the ruff increases its body mass at a rate of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.

Ruffs were formerly trapped for food in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at <a href="George%20Neville%20%28archbishop%29">Archbishop Neville's</a> enthronement banquet in 1465. The birds were netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before preparation for the table.

...if expedition is required, sugar is added, which will make them in a fortnight's
time a lump of fat: they then sell for two Shillings or half-a-crown a piece… The method of killing them is by cutting off their head with a pair of scissars, the quantity of blood that issues is very great, considering the size of the bird. They are dressed like the Woodcock, with their intestines; and, when killed at the critical time, say the Epicures, are reckoned the most delicious of all morsels.
The heavy toll on breeding birds, together with loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, meant that the species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden has resulted in the ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s and draining of wetlands has led to a decrease in the number of ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from <a href="Lake%20Chilwa">Lake Chilwa</a> in <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>.

Although this bird eats rice on the wintering grounds, where it can make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.

The ruff has a large range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.38–3.8 million square miles) and a population of at least 2,000,000 birds. The European population of 200,000–510,000 pairs, occupying more than half of the total breeding range, seems to have declined by up to 30% over ten years, but this may reflect geographical changes in breeding populations. Numbers in Asia do not appear to be declining, and more ruffs are wintering in Africa. The species as a whole is therefore not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the ruff is classified as "<a href="Least%20Concern">least concern</a>".

The most important breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway has expanded to the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline is a continuation of trend towards range contraction that has occurred over the last two centuries. The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.

Fossils from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> suggest that this species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its sensitivity to changing climate as well as to water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as <a href="avian%20influenza">influenza</a>, <a href="botulism">botulism</a> and <a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a>.

The ruff is one of the species to which the "<a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>" (AEWA) applies, where it is allocated to category 2c; that is, the populations in need of special attention as they are showing "significant long-term decline" in much of its range. This commits signatories to regulate the taking of listed species or their eggs, to establish protected areas to conserve habitats for the listed species, to regulate hunting and to monitor the populations of the birds concerned.
The ruff has three male forms, which differ in mating behaviour and in appearance: the typical territorial males which have a dark neck ruff, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and the very rare cryptic males known as "faeders" which have female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance of each individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by a simple genetic <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphism</a>. Territorial behaviour and appearance is <a href="recessive">recessive</a> to satellite behaviour and appearance, while preliminary research results suggest that the faeder characteristics are genetically controlled by a single dominant gene. It was originally thought that the difference between territorial and satellite males was due to a sex-linked genetic factor, but in fact the genetic <a href="locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a> relevant for the mating strategy is located on an <a href="autosome">autosome</a>, or non-sex <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>. That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene, not just males. The female does not normally show evidence of her genetic type, but when females are given <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> implants, they display the male behaviour corresponding to their <a href="genotype">genotype</a>. This testosterone-linked behaviour is unusual in birds, where external sexual characteristics are normally determined by the presence or absence of <a href="oestrogen">oestrogen</a>.

In 2016, two studies further pinpointed the responsible region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-<a href="Base%20pair">Mb</a> covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists were able to show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversion</a> created the faeder <a href="allele">allele</a>. About 500,000 years ago another rare <a href="Homologous%20recombination">recombination</a> event of faeder and resident <a href="allele">allele</a> in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite <a href="allele">allele</a>. The 4.5 <a href="Base%20pair">Mb</a> <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversion</a> covers 90 genes, one of them is the <a href="centromere">centromere</a> coding gene N- <a href="CENPN">CENPN</a>-, which is located exactly at one of the <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversion</a> breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is <a href="Zygosity">homozygous</a> <a href="Lethality">lethal</a>. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s have accumulated within the <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversion</a> i.e. three <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a> ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 <a href="Base%20pair">kb</a>. Two of these <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a> remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- <a href="HSD17B2">HSD17B2</a> and <a href="SDR42E1">SDR42E1</a>-both holding important roles in <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of <a href="steroid%20hormone">steroid hormone</a>s. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>, faeders and satellites only experience higher <a href="androstenedione">androstenedione</a> levels, a substance which is considered an <a href="Reaction%20intermediate">intermediate</a> in <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a "<a href="Cis-regulatory%20element">cis</a>"<a href="Cis-regulatory%20element">-acting</a> regulatory <a href="mutation">mutation</a> which is altering the <a href="Gene%20expression">expression</a> of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s and behaviour.

Keswick, Cumbria

Keswick ( ) is an English <a href="market%20town">market town</a> and <a href="civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a>, <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historically</a> in <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, and since 1974 in the <a href="Allerdale">Borough of Allerdale</a> in Cumbria. The town, in the <a href="Lake%20District%20National%20Park">Lake District National Park</a>, just north of <a href="Derwentwater">Derwentwater</a>, and from <a href="Bassenthwaite%20Lake">Bassenthwaite</a>, had a population of 4,821 at the time of the 2011 census.

There is considerable evidence of prehistoric occupation of the Keswick area, but the first recorded mention of the town dates from the <a href="13th%20century">13th century</a>, when <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a> granted a charter for Keswick's market, which has maintained a continuous 700-year existence. In <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a> times the town was an important mining area, and from the <a href="18th%20century">18th century</a> onwards it has increasingly been known as a holiday centre; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years. Its features include the <a href="The%20Moot%20Hall">Moot Hall</a>; a modern theatre, the <a href="Theatre%20by%20the%20Lake">Theatre by the Lake</a>; one of Britain's oldest surviving cinemas, the Alhambra; and the <a href="Keswick%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Keswick Museum and Art Gallery</a> in the town's largest open space, <a href="Fitz%20Park">Fitz Park</a>. Among the town's annual events is the <a href="Keswick%20Convention">Keswick Convention</a>, an <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> gathering attracting visitors from many countries.

Keswick became widely known for its association with the poets <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> and <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a>. Together with their fellow <a href="Lake%20Poets">Lake Poet</a> <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, based at Grasmere, away, they made the scenic beauty of the area widely known to readers in Britain and beyond. In the late 19th century and into the 20th, Keswick was the focus of several important initiatives by the growing conservation movement, often led by <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a>, vicar of the nearby Crosthwaite parish and co-founder of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, which has built up extensive holdings in the area.

The town is first recorded in Edward I's charter of the 13th century, as "Kesewik". Scholars have generally considered the name to be from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, meaning "farm where cheese is made", the word deriving from "cēse" (cheese) with a Scandinavian initial "k" and "wīc" (special place or dwelling), although not all academics agree. <a href="George%20T.%20Flom">George Flom</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a> (1919) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of <a href="Vikings">Viking</a>-settled areas, as Keswick was, would not have been given a <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20settlement%20of%20Britain">Saxon</a> name; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or <a href="Norse%20activity%20in%20the%20British%20Isles">Norse</a> origin, and means "Kell's place at the bend of the river". Among the later scholars supporting the "cheese farm" toponymy are <a href="Eilert%20Ekwall">Eilert Ekwall</a> (1960) and A D Mills (2011) (both <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>), and Diana Whaley (2006), for the <a href="English%20Place-Name%20Society">English Place-Name Society</a>.

Evidence of prehistoric occupation in the area includes the <a href="Castlerigg%20stone%20circle">Castlerigg stone circle</a> on the eastern fringe of the town, which has been dated to between 3000 and 2500 <a href="Anno%20Domini">BC</a>. <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>-era stone tools were unearthed inside the circle and in the centre of Keswick during the 19th century. The antiquary <a href="W.%20G.%20Collingwood">W G Collingwood</a>, commenting in 1925 about finds in the area, wrote that they showed "Stone Age man was fairly at home in the Lake District". There is little evidence of sustained settlement in the area during the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, but from excavations of <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s it is clear that there was some <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> occupation, circa 500 BC, although scholars are not agreed about how permanent it was.

In <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> Cumbria was the territory of the <a href="Carvetii">Carvetii</a>. As the site of the western part of <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>, it was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly <a href="Celts">Celtic</a>. Many local place names from the period, including that of the <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria">River Derwent</a>, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.

Several Christian saints preached the <a href="The%20gospel">Gospel</a> in the north of England in the late 6th and early 7th centuries <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a>; in Keswick and the surrounding area the most important figures were <a href="Herbert%20of%20Derwentwater">St Herbert of Derwentwater</a> and his contemporary <a href="Saint%20Mungo">St Kentigern</a>. The former, the pupil and friend of <a href="Cuthbert">St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne</a>, lived as a hermit on an island in Derwentwater, now named after him. Kentigern, who lived and preached in the area before moving to Wales, is traditionally held to have founded <a href="Crosthwaite%20Parish%20Church">Crosthwaite Church</a>, which was the parish church of Keswick until the 19th century.

Keswick's recorded history starts in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The area was conquered by the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Kingdom of Northumbria</a> in the seventh century, but Northumbria was destroyed by the <a href="Viking">Viking</a>s in the late ninth. In the early tenth century the British <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a> seized the area, and it remained part of Strathclyde until about 1050, when <a href="Siward%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Siward, Earl of Northumbria</a>, conquered Cumbria. In 1092 <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II of England</a>, son of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, marched north and established the great baronies of Allerdale-below-Derwent, Allerdale-above-Derwent, and Greystoke, the borders of which met at Keswick. In 1181 <a href="Jocelyn%20of%20Furness">Jocelyn of Furness</a> wrote of a new <a href="Crosthwaite%20Parish%20Church">church at Crosthwaite</a>, Keswick, founded by Alice de Romilly, the Lady of Allerdale, a direct descendant of William II's original barons. In 1189, <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> granted the rectory of Crosthwaite to the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> order of <a href="Fountains%20Abbey">Fountains Abbey</a>.

During the 13th century, agricultural land around the town was acquired by Fountains and <a href="Furness%20Abbey">Furness</a> Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold <a href="Derwent%20Island">Derwent Island</a> in Derwentwater, land at <a href="Watendlath">Watendlath</a>, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in <a href="Borrowdale">Borrowdale</a>. Keswick was at the hub of the monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.

With the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>, between 1536 and 1541, Furness and Fountains Abbeys were supplanted by new secular landlords for the farmers of Keswick and its neighbourhood. The buying and selling of sheep and wool were no longer centred on the great Abbeys, being handled locally by the new landowners and tenants. This enhanced Keswick's importance as a market centre, though at first the town remained only modestly prosperous: in the 1530s <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> wrote of it as "a lytle poore market town". By the second half of the century copper mining had made Keswick richer: in 1586 <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> wrote of "these copper works not only being sufficient for all England, but great quantities of the copper exported every year" with, at the centre, "Keswicke, a small market town, many years famous for the copper works as appears from a charter of king <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a>, and at present inhabited by miners".

Earlier copper mining had been small in scale, but <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, concerned for the defence of her kingdom, required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships. There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land. The experts in copper mining were German, and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel Hechstetter of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, to whom she granted a licence to "search, dig, try, roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold, silver, copper and quicksilver" in the Keswick area and elsewhere.
As well as copper, a new substance was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, and is now known as <a href="graphite">graphite</a>. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from the second half of the 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.

The copper mines prospered for about seventy years, but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline. Demand for copper fell and the cost of extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for <a href="Slate%20industry%23Other%20slate%20producing%20areas%20in%20Great%20Britain">slate</a> began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.

The historian George Bott regards <a href="John%20Dalton%20%28poet%29">John Dalton</a> (1709–63) and <a href="John%20Brown%20%28essayist%29">John Brown</a> (1715–66) as the pioneers of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a> published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described the view of the town as "the vale of Elysium in all its verdure", and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake. His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott's phrase, "an effective public relations job for Keswick". Painters such as <a href="Thomas%20Smith%20%28English%20painter%29">Thomas Smith of Derby</a> and <a href="William%20Bellers">William Bellers</a> also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area. In 1800 the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> wrote, "It is no small advantage that for two-thirds of the year we are in complete retirement – the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of all shapes & sizes." Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow <a href="Lake%20Poets">Lake Poets</a> (see <a href="Keswick%2C%20Cumbria%23Lake%20Poets%20and%20other%20Keswick%20notables">below</a>) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.
During the 18th century and into the 19th, <a href="turnpike%20trusts">turnpike trusts</a> were established and major roads in Cumberland were greatly improved. With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well-off visitors, particularly at times of war in mainland Europe, which made the aristocratic <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> impossible there. Regular public coach services were established in the 1760s, but they were expensive. The ten-hour journey from <a href="Whitehaven">Whitehaven</a> to Penrith via Keswick cost 12 shillings (equivalent to 60 pence), at a time when country labourers typically earned £24 a year or less, and the annual income of even the most prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than £200. Nonetheless, by the 19th century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000. Some of the Keswick inns that catered for affluent visitors remain as hotels, including the Queen's, where Gray stayed.
The construction of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the <a href="Cockermouth%2C%20Keswick%20and%20Penrith%20Railway">Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway</a> (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the <a href="coke%20%28fuel%29">coking</a> coal from <a href="County%20Durham">Durham</a> on the east side of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a> to Keswick.

In addition to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as a <a href="cottage%20industry">cottage industry</a>, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose-built by several companies. Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.

The Moot Hall was rebuilt in 1813, and the lower floor was used as a market house on Saturdays. <a href="Coal%20gas">Coal gas</a> was supplied by a gas works from 1846; the Keswick library opened in 1849; a water works began operation in 1856; and Keswick police station opened in 1857. The local weekly newspaper, "The Keswick Reminder" was founded in 1896, and in 2014 continues to be published every Friday. In an article in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" in 1978, <a href="Christopher%20Brasher">Christopher Brasher</a> wrote that as long as the "Reminder" flourishes, "there will be one corner of these islands that is forever England."
In 1883 <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a> was appointed vicar of Crosthwaite. In a study of Lake District towns in 1974, H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would be the equivalent of writing about <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley's impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the <a href="Keswick%20School%20of%20Industrial%20Art">Keswick School of Industrial Art</a>, which trained local craftsmen and -women from 1894 until it closed in 1986. He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School. As co-founder of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, Rawnsley contributed to Keswick's continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.

Keswick's history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism, the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment. The Cumberland Pencil Company, formed at the turn of the century, occupied a large factory near the <a href="River%20Greta%2C%20Cumbria">River Greta</a> on the road leading out of Keswick towards Cockermouth. The conservation movement continued to develop; Rawnsley led successful campaigns to save the medieval Greta and <a href="Portinscale">Portinscale</a> bridges from replacement with ferro-concrete structures; and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally. In the First World War Keswick lost many of its young men: the war memorial near <a href="Fitz%20Park">Fitz Park</a> commemorates 117 names, from a population at the time of less than 4,500. By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in Cumberland and Westmorland. An article in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" in 1934 called it "the capital of the Lake District", and continued:
During the Second World War students from <a href="Liverpool%20Hope%20University">St Katharine's College, Liverpool</a> and <a href="Roedean%20School">Roedean School</a>, Sussex, were evacuated to Keswick when their own buildings were requisitioned for use as a hospital and a navy base respectively. Students were also brought to the safety of Keswick from <a href="Central%20Newcastle%20High%20School">Central Newcastle High School</a>, Hunmanby Hall School, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, and the Liverpool Orphanage.

The creation of the <a href="Lake%20District%20National%20Park">Lake District National Park</a> in 1951, with strict control over new development, prevented any expansion of the town beyond its pre-war borders. Keswick's population has remained stable at a little below 5,000 residents. The town's reliance on tourism increased in 2006 when Cumberland Pencils moved production from Keswick to Lillyhall, <a href="Workington">Workington</a>, only the <a href="Cumberland%20Pencil%20Museum">Cumberland Pencil Museum</a> remaining at the old site. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 60 per cent of the population were employed in hotels, restaurants and distribution. A survey of retail premises in 2000 found that more than ten per cent were outdoor clothes shops, a similar proportion were cafés or restaurants, and more than eight per cent were gift shops. The age profile of the Keswick population is significantly higher than the English average. In 2011 children under 10 made up 7.6 per cent of the town's population, compared with 11.9 per cent for England as a whole. Between ages 10 and 20 the comparable figures are 10.2 and 12.1; and from ages 20 to 44, 25.9 as against 34.3. The percentage of Keswick's population aged 45 and upwards is above the national average, the largest difference being within the 75- to 84-year-old bracket, which contains 9.6 per cent of Keswick's population compared with a national average of 5.5. Figures from the same census show that Keswick has fewer than average "large employers and higher managerial occupations" and more small employers and self-employed people. Long-term unemployment is considerably below the average for England.

In medieval times the township was within the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of <a href="James%20Radclyffe%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Derwentwater">James Radclyffe</a>, third Earl of Derwentwater, in 1716 for his part in the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201715">Jacobite rebellion</a> the previous year. In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the <a href="Greenwich%20Hospital%2C%20London">Greenwich Hospital</a>, London. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century. In 1925 the then owner, Sir John Randles, gave the National Trust 90 acres of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland.

Keswick became a Local Government District in 1853 and an <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> with three wards in 1894, reflecting its growth in the latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and <a href="Allerdale">Allerdale</a> Borough Council. Since 2010 Keswick has been in the <a href="Copeland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Copeland</a> parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of <a href="Workington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Workington</a> and before that <a href="Penrith%20and%20The%20Border%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Penrith and The Border</a>. The <a href="Wards%20and%20electoral%20divisions%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">electoral ward</a> of Keswick stretches beyond the confines of the parish boundary and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5,243.

Keswick lies in north-western England, in the heart of the northern Lake District. The town is south-west of Carlisle, northwest of <a href="Windermere">Windermere</a> and south-east of Cockermouth. <a href="Derwentwater">Derwentwater</a>, the lake to the south-west of the town, is approximately long by wide and is some deep. It contains several islands, including Derwent Isle, Lord's Island, Rampsholme Island and St Herbert's Island, the largest. Derwent Isle is the only island on the lake that is inhabited; it is run by the National Trust and open to visitors five days a year. The land between Keswick and the lake consists mainly of fields and areas of woodland, including Isthmus Wood, Cockshot Wood, Castlehead Wood and Horseclose and Great Wood, further to the south. The <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria">River Derwent</a> flows from Derwentwater to <a href="Bassenthwaite%20Lake">Bassenthwaite</a>, the most northerly of the major Cumbrian lakes. The Derwent and its tributary the <a href="River%20Greta%2C%20Cumbria">Greta</a>, which flows through Keswick, meet to the east of Portinscale. The source of the Greta is near <a href="Threlkeld">Threlkeld</a>, at the confluence of the <a href="River%20Glenderamackin">River Glenderamackin</a> and <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Beck">St John's Beck</a>.

Keswick is in the lee of the <a href="Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> group, the oldest group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a triangle sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of <a href="Thornthwaite">Thornthwaite</a>, is <a href="Whinlatter%20Pass">Whinlatter Forest Park</a> and <a href="Grisedale%20Pike">Grisedale Pike</a>. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is <a href="St%20John%27s%20in%20the%20Vale">St John's in the Vale</a>, at the foot of the <a href="Helvellyn%20range">Helvellyn range</a>, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.

Climatically, Keswick is in the North West sector of the UK, which is characterised by cool summers, mild winters, and high monthly rainfalls throughout the year. The wettest months fall at the end of the year, the peak average of 189.3 mm falling in October. Rain, sunshine and temperature figures are shown below.

The registers of Crosthwaite Church stated that there were 238 interments in 1623, believed to have been something between a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at that time. In the 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.

In the 1801 census, the township of Keswick, including the town and surrounding hamlets, had a reported population of 1,350 people. The population grew at a steady rate, increasing to 1,683 in 1811, 1,901 in 1821, 2,159 in 1831, 2,442 in 1841, and 2,618 in 1851. In 1871 the township had a population of 2,777 people. The population grew at a faster rate towards the late 19th century and by 1901 it stood at 4,451 people. There has been little fluctuation in population since, and in the 1991 census the town had a population of 4,836. In the 2001 census, 4,984 people were recorded, and 4,821 in 2011. At the 2011 census, 57.9 per cent of the population identified as Christian, 31.5 per cent as non-religious, 1.2 per cent as Muslim and 8.3 per cent did not specify.

Keswick is the home of the Theatre by the Lake, opened in 1999. The theatre serves a dual purpose as the permanent home of a professional repertory company and a venue for visiting performers and festivals. It replaced the <a href="Century%20Theatre%20%28UK%29">Century Theatre</a> or "Blue Box", which had spent 25 years in semi-retirement on a permanent lakeside site in Keswick, after a career of similar length as a mobile theatre. The Alhambra cinema in St John Street, opened in 1913, is one of the oldest continuously functioning cinemas in the country; it is equipped with digital technology and satellite receiving equipment to allow the live screening of plays, operas and ballet from the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>, <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> and other venues.

The town is the site of the <a href="Cumberland%20Pencil%20Museum">Cumberland Pencil Museum</a>. One of the exhibits is what is claimed to be the world's largest coloured pencil. Fitz Park, on the bank of the River Greta, is home to the <a href="Keswick%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Keswick Museum and Art Gallery</a>, a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> museum which features the <a href="Musical%20Stones%20of%20Skiddaw">Musical Stones of Skiddaw</a>, Southey manuscripts, and a collection of sculptures and paintings of regional and wider importance, including works by <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Epstein</a>, <a href="John%20Opie">John Opie</a>, <a href="Richard%20Westall">Richard Westall</a> and others. After extensive restoration and enlargement the museum reopened in 2014. In 2001 the cricket ground in Fitz Park was named the most beautiful in England by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricket%20Monthly">Wisden Cricket Monthly</a>".

<a href="Greta%20Hall">Greta Hall</a> (see Lake Poets, below), is a <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>. The home of Coleridge in 1800–04 and Southey from 1803 until 1843, it later became part of Keswick School and is now in private ownership, partly divided into holiday flats. The three-storey house dates to the late 18th century and features a flush-panelled central double door with Gothic top panels and Venetian windows. A carved oak fireplace inside is dated to 1684. <a href="The%20Moot%20Hall">The Moot Hall</a> is a prominent <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade II*</a> listed building situated at the southern end of Main Street. It was built in 1571 and rebuilt in 1695, and the current building dates to 1813. It is built of lime-washed stone and slate walling, and has a square tower on the north end with a round-arched doorway and a double flight of exterior steps. At the top of the tower is what the Keswick Tourist Information Board describes as an "unusual one-handed clock". Formerly an assembly building, The Moot Hall contains a tourist information centre on the ground floor, with an art gallery on the floor above.

The prominent social thinker and art critic <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, who had many associations with Keswick, once said that the town was a place almost too beautiful to live in. In October 1900, mainly through the efforts of Rawnsley, a simple memorial of Borrowdale slate was erected to Ruskin at Friars Crag. The monument is a now a <a href="Grade%20II%20listed">Grade II listed</a> structure.

Until 1838 Keswick had no <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of Crosthwaite. The present parish church, St John's, was designed by <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> and consecrated in 1838. It is geometrical in style, with pink castle-head <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> sandstone and a slate roof. The church was extended in 1862, 1882 and 1889 by the parish's benefactors the Marshall family; the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> windows, designed by <a href="Henry%20Holiday">Henry Holiday</a>, installed in 1879, were taken down and reinstalled when the chancel was extended in 1889. St John's became a Grade II* listed building in 1951. Keswick's former parish church, <a href="Crosthwaite%20Parish%20Church">St Kentigern's</a>, at Crosthwaite, just outside the town, is also Grade II* listed. Dated to at least the 14th century, it is built mainly in the Tudor-Gothic style and was expanded in 1523 and later restored in 1844 by <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">George Gilbert Scott</a>.

The <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>s had an early meeting house in the town, replaced in 1715 by one at Underskiddaw. Protestant dissenters met at a private house from 1705 or before, moving to a chapel in Lake Road in the latter part of the 18th century. A <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational</a> chapel was built in 1858–59. The first <a href="Wesleyanism">Wesleyan</a> chapel was built in 1814 in a small yard off Main Street at a cost of £331 10s; the present <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> church is in Southey Street. Since 1928 <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a> in Keswick have been served by Our Lady of the Lakes and St Charles in High Hill. A new <a href="Friends%20meeting%20house">Quaker meeting house</a> opened in the town in 1994. An <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> church was inaugurated in 2007, holding services in Keswick and the nearby village of <a href="Braithwaite">Braithwaite</a>.

As at 2014 no other religions maintain dedicated buildings in Keswick; Muslim worship is accommodated on Fridays in a room at the local council building in Main Street.

Keswick's old inns and their successors include many listed buildings, mainly Grade II in designation. The George Hotel, stated to be the oldest inn in the town, dates to the 16th century, with the alterations made during the <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> period still evident. The King's Arms Hotel, in the main market square, dates from the early 19th century; it is built from <a href="stucco">stucco</a>ed stone, with <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> shop windows on the ground floor. The Queen's Hotel in Main Street, a <a href="pebbledashed">pebbledashed</a> stone building dating from the late 18th century, was renamed "The Inn on the Square" in 2015. The Bank Tavern in Main Street and The Dog and Gun public house in Lake Road are both Grade II listed 18th-century buildings.

The following are the listed buildings in Keswick. The listings are graded:


The Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, adjoining Crosthwaite churchyard, was an ancient institution, its date of foundation uncertain. In 1819 the parish of Crosthwaite had five or six schools in the town and the outlying areas, with a total of 332 children. By 1833 Keswick had twelve daily schools, including a new <a href="National%20school%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">National School</a> at High Hill. The new parish church of Keswick, St John's, started educational work in 1840 with a Sunday school which also educated infant boys, and later girls, on weekdays. A full-time boys' school opened in 1853. For older pupils, Keswick School, the free co-educational grammar school, successor to the Crosthwaite Free Grammar School, opened at a site diagonally opposite Greta Bridge in 1898. In 1951 a new <a href="secondary%20modern">secondary modern</a> school was built at Lairthwaite in Underskiddaw.

Junior education is provided by St Herbert's School, which had a roll of 263 in 2013. At senior level, Keswick and Lairthwaite schools merged in 1980 as a single comprehensive secondary school, with the name Keswick School. It was included in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"'s list of the top thirty comprehensives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014. The <a href="Local%20Education%20Authority">Local Education Authority</a> for Keswick is <a href="Cumbria%20County%20Council">Cumbria</a>.

The Mary Hewetson Cottage Hospital, founded in 1892, has fifteen beds and a minor injuries unit. It underwent a major rebuilding and upgrade in 2013.

Keswick is home to Keswick Football Club. The principal team plays in the Westmorland League Division One, and it also has a reserve team which plays in Westmorland League Division Two, a female team which plays in the Cumbria League, juniors who compete in the under-16, under-14, under-12 and under-10 categories in the Penrith Junior Football League; there is a veteran team, which competes in the Cumbria League. Keswick Rugby Union Football Club, established in 1879, plays at Davidson Park, and has teams that play in the Cumbrian League and the Cumbria Rugby Union Raging Bull Competition. The rugby club is involved in the organisation of the Keswick Half Marathon, usually held in the first week of May.

Keswick Tennis Club has grass courts in upper Fitz Park, and also runs hard courts on Keswick's Community Sports Area in the lower park area. Keswick Cricket Club was established in the 1880s. Its principal team competes in the North Lancashire and Cumbria Cricket League, Premier Division. The second team plays in the Eden Valley Cricket League, 3rd Division, and the club also has junior under-11, under-13, and under-15 teams and a women's cricket team. Keswick Fitz Park Bowls Club was founded in 1882.

In cycling, Keswick hosted the Keswick Bikes Borrowdale Cross of the North West League, second round, in September 2010 for junior riders, an event that was supported by the <a href="British%20Cycling%20Federation">British Cycling Federation</a>. The same month, the town hosted an activity weekend for children, involving the juniors of the Brooke Steelers Wheelchair Basketball Team, whose senior players who were competing in a race from Keswick to Penrith to raise money for children's cancer. Keswick is also home to Keswick Croquet Club, Keswick Archers, and Greta (Keswick) Junior Badminton Club, for children from eight to 16 years of age. The town leisure centre, Keswick Leisure Pool and Fitness Centre, is operated and managed by Carlisle Leisure Limited (CLL), and has a pool and fitness facilities, and offers lessons in canoeing.

Keswick is on the <a href="A66%20road">A66 road</a> linking <a href="Workington">Workington</a> and Penrith, as well as the <a href="A591%20road">A591</a>, linking the town to <a href="Windermere%2C%20Cumbria%20%28town%29">Windermere</a>, <a href="Kendal">Kendal</a> and Carlisle (via the <a href="A595%20road">A595</a>).

There are no rail links to Keswick; the line built in the 1860s for the <a href="Cockermouth%2C%20Keswick%20and%20Penrith%20Railway">Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway</a> closed in 1972. Since the 1990s a plan to rebuild it has been under discussion. Some 90 percent of the earthworks of the railway still exist, but according to 2000 estimates, a reopening would cost £25 million. In 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals. The bus journey from the main line station at Penrith to Keswick takes a scheduled 47 minutes.

The town is served by other bus routes providing direct connections with Carlisle, Cockermouth, Kendal, Lancaster, Penrith, Windermere, Workington, and other towns and villages in the north west. The flow of traffic from Penrith to Cockermouth and beyond was eased after the A66 was diverted to a new bypass in 1974, a development that caused controversy because of a prominent new viaduct carrying the road across the Greta Gorge to the north of the town.

The majority of visitors arrive by car and are catered for by three town centre car parks, another large one next to the Theatre by the Lake, and smaller ones elsewhere in the town.

Annual events in the town's calendar include the <a href="Keswick%20Film%20Festival">Keswick Film Festival</a> (February–March). It features screenings of old and new films, interviews with directors, and the festival's <a href="Keswick%20Film%20Festival%23Osprey%20Short%20Film%20Awards">Osprey Awards</a> for short films by local filmmakers. The ten-day Words by the Water literary festival is held in March every year, based at the Theatre by the Lake. The festival began in 1995, and events have been presented by <a href="Melvyn%20Bragg">Melvyn Bragg</a>, <a href="Louis%20de%20Berni%C3%A8res">Louis de Bernières</a>, <a href="Germaine%20Greer">Germaine Greer</a>, <a href="Steve%20Jones%20%28biologist%29">Steve Jones</a>, <a href="Penelope%20Lively">Penelope Lively</a>, <a href="Princess%20Michael%20of%20Kent">Princess Michael of Kent</a>, <a href="Michael%20Rosen">Michael Rosen</a> and <a href="Joanna%20Trollope">Joanna Trollope</a>.

In May each year, Keswick is host to three contrasting events. The Keswick Half Marathon, in the early part of the month takes participants around Derwentwater with an additional loop into <a href="Newlands%20Valley">Newlands Valley</a>. In the second week of May there is the four-day Keswick Jazz Festival, with more than 100 jazz events at a dozen local venues. Participants include British and international exponents of mainstream and traditional jazz. After the Jazz Festival is the four-day Keswick Mountain Festival in mid-May. In the words of the organisers, the festival "celebrates everything we all love about the outdoors". It includes <a href="Ravine">ghyll</a> scrambling, mountain biking, guided walks, map reading, canoeing, climbing, a triathlon and other events.
The main event of the town's calendar in June is the Keswick Beer Festival, a two-day event that attracts more than 5,000 participants each year. July is marked by the opening of the annual <a href="Keswick%20Convention">Keswick Convention</a>, an international gathering of <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> Christians, described in 1925 as "the last stronghold of British Puritanism", promoting biblical teaching and pious lifestyles. Among those associated with the Convention have been <a href="Frank%20Buchman">Frank Buchman</a> and <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a>. The event has grown from a single week to three weeks, straddling the latter part of July and early August.

In August, Keswick features the Derwentwater Regatta. It was inaugurated by the eccentric local landowner Joseph Pocklington in 1792, and after a lapse of more than two centuries was revived in 2013. Its organisers describe it as "A weekend of mayhem and madness afloat, with the chance to climb aboard in a variety of races on Derwentwater". The Keswick Agricultural Show, founded in 1860, has traditionally been held on August Bank Holiday Monday at the western edge of the town on the Crossing Fields section of the open land known as the Howrahs. The show features both commercial and charity stands, and attracts large numbers of competitors, exhibitors and spectators. From 2014 the venue has changed to Pump Field, a few hundred yards further from the town centre towards Braithwaite.

Classical music is presented throughout the year, both in conjunction with the Lake District Summer Music Festival and independently through the Keswick Choral Society and the Keswick Music Society, which was founded in 1947. Performers in Keswick have included the <a href="Chilingirian%20Quartet">Chilingirian Quartet</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Northern%20Sinfonia">Royal Northern Sinfonia</a>, <a href="Tasmin%20Little">Tasmin Little</a>, the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Sinfonia">City of London Sinfonia</a>, <a href="Red%20Priest">Red Priest</a> and <a href="Nicolai%20Demidenko">Nicolai Demidenko</a>.

Coleridge and <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> were close friends and collaborators; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott's word, inevitable that Coleridge would follow suit. Six months after the Wordsworths moved into <a href="Dove%20Cottage">Dove Cottage</a> at <a href="Grasmere%20%28village%29">Grasmere</a>, Coleridge leased Greta Hall in Keswick, away. In 1803 <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a>, Coleridge's brother-in-law, agreed to share the house with Coleridge and his family. Southey remained at Greta Hall after Coleridge left in 1804, and it remained Southey's family home until his death in 1843. Many famous literary figures stayed at Greta Hall in these years, including the Wordsworths, <a href="Charles%20Lamb">Charles and Mary Lamb</a>, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Quincey">Thomas de Quincey</a>, <a href="William%20Hazlitt">William Hazlitt</a>, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, and <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>. Lamb, a Londoner devoted to his native city, remained doubtful of the attractions of the Lake District, but most of the visitors to Greta Hall wrote eloquently of the beauty of the scenery, and further enhanced the public regard for, and desire to visit, the area. Southey was well regarded locally, but played little part in the life of the town. He is buried in Crosthwaite churchyard and there is a memorial to him inside the church, with an inscription written by Wordsworth.
Among Keswick notables before the Lake Poets was <a href="John%20Bankes">Sir John Bankes</a>, a leading Royalist during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. He was <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I's</a> Attorney General and Chief Justice. Bankes was born at Castlerigg near Keswick in 1589. A bust in his memory is in upper Fitz Park close to the museum. In 2014 he was further commemorated by the conversion of the former Keswick courthouse into a bar named in his honour with his full title, "The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas".

Later residents of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet and founder of the <a href="Society%20for%20Psychical%20Research">Society for Psychical Research</a>, <a href="Frederic%20William%20Henry%20Myers">Frederic Myers</a>, who was born in Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare <a href="Donald%20Watson">Donald Watson</a>, founder of the <a href="Vegan%20Society">Vegan Society</a>, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers <a href="George%20and%20Ashley%20Abraham">George and Ashley Abraham</a> lived and worked in Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams' era.

Of literary figures after the Lake Poets among those most closely associated with Keswick was the novelist <a href="Hugh%20Walpole">Hugh Walpole</a>. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange at the opposite end of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune."

The Hardy Boys

The Hardy Boys, <a href="Frank%20Hardy%20%28The%20Hardy%20Boys%29">Frank</a> and <a href="Joe%20Hardy%20%28The%20Hardy%20Boys%29">Joe Hardy</a>, are fictional characters who appear in several mystery series for children and teens. The series revolves around the teenagers acting as amateur sleuths, solving cases that stumped their adult counterparts. The characters were created by American writer <a href="Edward%20Stratemeyer">Edward Stratemeyer</a>, the founder of <a href="book%20packager">book-packaging</a> firm <a href="Stratemeyer%20Syndicate">Stratemeyer Syndicate</a>; the books themselves are written by <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a>s under the <a href="collective%20pseudonym">collective pseudonym</a> <a href="Franklin%20W.%20Dixon">Franklin W. Dixon</a>. 

The Hardy Boys have evolved since their debut in 1927. Beginning in 1959, the books were extensively revised, partially to eliminate <a href="racial%20stereotypes">racial stereotypes</a>. The books were also written in a simpler style to compete with television. Some critics argue that the Hardy Boys changed in the process, becoming affluent and law-respecting "agents of the adult ruling class". Most lamented the loss of the richer pre-war descriptive style, but saw the updates as an attempt to modernize the stories. Similar complaints were made about the updates to <a href="Nancy%20Drew">Nancy Drew</a>, the female counterpart of the series.

A new "Hardy Boys" series, the "Hardy Boys Casefiles", was created in 1987, and featured murders, violence, and international espionage. The original "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories" series ended in 2005. A new series, "<a href="Undercover%20Brothers">Undercover Brothers</a>", was launched the same year, featuring updated versions of the characters who narrate their adventures in the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first person</a>. "Undercover Brothers" ended in 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by "<a href="The%20Hardy%20Boys%20Adventures">The Hardy Boys Adventures</a>", also narrated in the first person.

Through all these changes, the characters have remained popular; the books sell more than a million copies annually, several new volumes are published each year, and the adventures have been translated into more than 25 languages. The boys have been featured in five television shows and several video games, and have helped promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans. Critics have many explanations for the characters' longevity, suggesting that the Hardy Boys embody simple wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept, and the possibility of the triumph of good over evil.

The Hardy Boys, Frank and Joe Hardy, are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. Frank is eighteen (sixteen in earlier versions), and Joe is seventeen (fifteen in earlier versions). They live in the city of <a href="Bayport%20%28The%20Hardy%20Boys%29">Bayport</a> on <a href="Barmet%20Bay">Barmet Bay</a> with their father, detective <a href="Fenton%20Hardy">Fenton Hardy</a>; their mother, <a href="Laura%20Hardy%20%28Hardy%20Boys%29">Laura Hardy</a>; and their <a href="Aunt%20Gertrude">Aunt Gertrude</a>. The brothers attend high school in Bayport, where they are in the same grade, but school is rarely mentioned in the books and never hinders their solving of mysteries. In the older stories, the Boys' mysteries are often linked to their father's confidential cases. He sometimes requests their assistance, while at other times they stumble upon relevant villains and incidents. In the "<a href="Undercover%20Brothers">Undercover Brothers</a>" series (2005-2012), the Hardys are members of and receive cases from <a href="American%20Teens%20Against%20Crime">American Teens Against Crime</a>. The Hardy Boys are sometimes assisted in solving mysteries by their friends <a href="Chet%20Morton">Chet Morton</a>, <a href="List%20of%20The%20Hardy%20Boys%20characters%23Phil%20Cohen">Phil Cohen</a>, <a href="Biff%20Hooper">Biff Hooper</a>, <a href="List%20of%20The%20Hardy%20Boys%20characters%23Jerry%20Gilroy">Jerry Gilroy</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Prito">Tony Prito</a>; and, less frequently, by their <a href="platonic%20love">platonic</a> girlfriends <a href="Callie%20Shaw">Callie Shaw</a> and <a href="Iola%20Morton">Iola Morton</a> (Chet's sister).

In each novel, the Hardy Boys are constantly involved in adventure and action. Despite frequent danger, the boys "never lose their nerve ... They "are" hardy boys, luckier and more clever than anyone around them." They live in an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue: "Never were so many assorted <a href="felonies">felonies</a> committed in a simple American small town. Murder, drug peddling, race horse kidnapping, <a href="Diamond%20smugglers">diamond smuggling</a>, <a href="medical%20malpractice">medical malpractice</a>, big-time auto theft, even (in the 1940s) the hijacking of <a href="strategic%20material">strategic material</a>s and <a href="espionage">espionage</a>, all were conducted with Bayport as a nucleus." With so much in common, the boys are so little differentiated that one commentator facetiously describes them thus: "The boys' characters basically broke down this way – Frank had dark hair; Joe was blond." In general, however, "Frank was the thinker while Joe was more impulsive, and perhaps a little more athletic." The two boys are invariably on good terms with each other and never engage in <a href="sibling%20rivalry">sibling rivalry</a>, except in the "New Hardy Boys Casefiles" series.

Frank and Joe are somewhat wealthy and often travel to far-away locations, including Mexico in "<a href="The%20Mark%20on%20the%20Door">The Mark on the Door</a>" (1934), Scotland in "<a href="The%20Secret%20Agent%20on%20Flight%20101">The Secret Agent on Flight 101</a>" (1967), Iceland in "<a href="The%20Arctic%20Patrol%20Mystery">The Arctic Patrol Mystery</a>" (1969), Egypt in "The Mummy Case" (1980), and Kenya in "The Mystery of the Black Rhino" (2003). The Hardys also travel across the United States by motorcycle, motor boat, <a href="iceboat">iceboat</a>, train, airplane, and their own car.

The characters were conceived in 1926 by <a href="Edward%20Stratemeyer">Edward Stratemeyer</a>, founder of <a href="book%20packager">book-packaging</a> firm <a href="Stratemeyer%20Syndicate">Stratemeyer Syndicate</a>. Stratemeyer pitched the series to publishers <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a> and suggested that the boys be called the Keene Boys, the Scott Boys, the Hart Boys, or the Bixby Boys. Grosset & Dunlap editors approved the project, but, for reasons unknown, chose the name "The Hardy Boys". The first three titles were published in 1927, and were an immediate success: by mid-1929, more than 115,000 books had been sold. So successful was the series that Stratemeyer created <a href="Nancy%20Drew">Nancy Drew</a> as a female counterpart to the Hardys.

Each volume is penned by a <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a> under the pseudonym <a href="Franklin%20W.%20Dixon">Franklin W. Dixon</a>. In accordance with the customs of <a href="Stratemeyer%20Syndicate">Stratemeyer Syndicate</a> series production, ghostwriters for the Syndicate signed contracts that have sometimes been interpreted as requiring authors to sign away all rights to authorship or future <a href="royalties">royalties</a>. The contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate. In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, "roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the syndicate ghosts." During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> this fee was lowered, first to $100 and later to $75. All royalties went to the Syndicate; all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Stratemeyer Syndicate office, and the Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names.

The Syndicate's process for creating the "Hardy Boys" books consisted of creating a detailed outline, with all elements of plot; drafting a <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>; and editing the manuscript. Edward Stratemeyer's daughter, Edna Stratemeyer Squier, and possibly Stratemeyer himself, wrote outlines for the first volumes in the series. Beginning in 1934, Stratemeyer's other daughter, <a href="Harriet%20Adams">Harriet Stratemeyer Adams</a>, began contributing plot outlines; she and <a href="Andrew%20Svenson">Andrew Svenson</a> wrote most of the plot outlines for the next several decades. Other plot outliners included Vincent Buranelli, James Duncan Lawrence, and Tom Mulvey.

Most of the early volumes were written by Canadian <a href="Leslie%20McFarlane">Leslie McFarlane</a>, who authored nineteen of the first twenty-five titles and co-authored volume 17 "<a href="The%20Secret%20Warning">The Secret Warning</a>", between 1927 and 1946. Unlike many other Syndicate ghostwriters, McFarlane was regarded highly enough by the Syndicate that he was frequently given advances of $25 or $50, and during the Depression, when fees were lowered, he was paid $85 for each Hardy Boys book when other Syndicate ghostwriters were receiving only $75 for their productions. According to McFarlane's family, he despised the series and its characters.

After co-authoring Volume 17, John Button, with Volume 18, "<a href="The%20Twisted%20Claw">The Twisted Claw</a>" (1939), took over the series full-time until 1942; McFarlane resumed with Volume 22, "<a href="The%20Flickering%20Torch%20Mystery">The Flickering Torch Mystery</a>" (1943). McFarlane's last contribution was Volume 24, "<a href="The%20Short-Wave%20Mystery">The Short-Wave Mystery</a>" (1945); his wife, Amy, authored Volume 26, "<a href="The%20Phantom%20Freighter">The Phantom Freighter</a>" (1947). Over the next several decades, other volumes were written by Adams, Svenson, Lawrence, Buranelli, William Dougherty, and James Buechler. Beginning in 1959, the series was extensively revised and re-written. Many authors worked on the revised books, writing new manuscripts; some of them also wrote plot outlines and edited the books. Among the authors who worked on the revised versions were Adams, Svenson, Buechler, Lilo Wuenn, Anne Shultes, Alistair Hunter, Tom Mulvey, Patricia Doll, and Priscilla Baker-Carr.

In 1979, the "Hardy Boys" books began to be published in <a href="paperback">paperback</a> rather than <a href="hardcover">hardcover</a>. Lawrence and Buranelli continued to write titles; other authors included Karl Harr III and Laurence Swinburne. In 1984, the rights to the series were sold, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, to <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>. New York book packager Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories" and a new series, the "<a href="Hardy%20Boys%20Casefiles">Hardy Boys Casefiles</a>".

In 1980, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a> and the lack of publicity for the "Hardy Boys"&apos; 50th anniversary in 1977, <a href="Harriet%20Adams">Harriet Adams</a> (née Stratemeyer) switched publishers for the "Hardy Boys" and "Nancy Drew", as well as other series, to Simon & Schuster. Grosset & Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and Simon & Schuster, citing "breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition" and requesting $300 million in damages.

The outcome of the case turned largely on the question of who had written the "Nancy Drew" series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the "<a href="Nancy%20Drew%20Mystery%20Stories">Nancy Drew Mystery Stories</a>", she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many "Nancy Drew" titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When <a href="Mildred%20Benson">Mildred Benson</a>, the author of the early "Nancy Drew" volumes, was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both "Nancy Drew" and the "Hardy Boys" as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.

The Hardy Boys have gone through many permutations over the years. Beginning in 1959, the books were extensively revised, and some commentators find that the Hardys' characters changed in the process. Commentators also sometimes see differences between the Hardy Boys of the original "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories" and the Hardy Boys of the "<a href="Hardy%20Boys%20Casefiles">Hardy Boys Casefiles</a>" or the new "Undercover Brothers" series.

The early volumes, largely written by <a href="Leslie%20McFarlane">Leslie McFarlane</a>, have been praised for their atmosphere and writing style, qualities often considered lacking in juvenile series books. McFarlane's writing is clear and filled with specific details, making his works superior to many other Stratemeyer series titles. Such, at least, was McFarlane's intention: "It seemed to me the Hardy Boys deserved something better than the slapdash treatment Dave Fearless had been getting... I opted for Quality." The volumes not written by McFarlane or his wife were penned by John Button, who wrote the series from 1938 to 1942; this period is sometimes referred to as the "Weird Period" as the writing is full of inconsistencies and the Hardy Boys' adventures involve futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations.

In general, the world of these early volumes is a "[dark] and ... divided place." In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an attitude apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in "<a href="The%20Great%20Airport%20Mystery">The Great Airport Mystery</a>" (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, so much so that at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative "lack [of] sympathy with the American power structure." In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?"

The books' attitudes towards minority characters are a matter of disagreement. These early volumes have been called models of diversity for their day, since among the Hardys' friends are Phil Cohen, who is <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>, and the <a href="Italians">Italian</a> immigrant Tony Prito. However, these two friends are rarely involved in the Hardys' adventures, a level of friendship reserved for <a href="Biff%20Hooper">Biff Hooper</a> and <a href="Chet%20Morton">Chet Morton</a>. The books have been extensively criticized for their use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and their <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a>. Vilnoff, for example, the villain in "<a href="The%20Sinister%20Signpost">The Sinister Sign-Post</a>" (1936), is described as "swarthy" and "a foreigner", notes critic Steve Burgess.

We sense his untrustworthy nature immediately when he sits down beside the boys at a football game and doesn't understand it, despite the boys' best efforts to explain. When he does grasp something, you know it. "I onnerstand pairfectly," he says. Later he adds genially, "I haf you vhere I vant you now!" Can't quite place the accent? It's foreign. Twenty-five chapters are not enough to solve the mystery of his nationality.

<a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> are the targets of much racism, being depicted as unintelligent, lazy, and superstitious, "bumpkin rescuers" at best and "secretive and conspiratorial villains" at worst. Benjamin Lefebvre notes that Harriet Adams at times rebuked Leslie McFarlane for not sufficiently following her instructions regarding the portrayal of African-American characters; he writes that it is not clear "whether Adams rewrote parts of McFarlane's manuscripts to add [racist] details or to what extent these early texts would now be considered even more notoriously racist had McFarlane followed Adams's instructions more carefully." In "<a href="Footprints%20Under%20the%20Window">Footprints Under the Window</a>" (1933), Chinese-American men are portrayed as effeminate threats both to national security and white heteromasculinity. <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> received mixed treatment; those living within the continental United States are portrayed as members of once-noble tribes whose greatness has been diminished by the coming of white men, while those living outside the continental U.S. are "portrayed as uneducated, easily manipulated, or semi-savage." However, <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>s are generally treated as equals; <a href="Mexican%20history">Mexico's history</a> and <a href="Mexican%20culture">culture</a> are treated with respect and admiration.

The "Hardy Boys" volumes were extensively revised beginning in 1959 at the insistence of publishers <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a>, and against the wishes of Harriet Adams. The revision project, which also encompassed the "<a href="Nancy%20Drew%20Mystery%20Stories">Nancy Drew Mystery Stories</a>", was sparked largely by letters that parents had been writing to Grosset & Dunlap since at least 1948, complaining about the prevalence of racial stereotypes in the books. Volume 14 in the "Hardy Boys" series, "<a href="The%20Hidden%20Harbor%20Mystery">The Hidden Harbor Mystery</a>" (1935), was singled out for particular and repeated attention for its portrayal of a black criminal who organizes a gang of black boys and treats whites disrespectfully. As one parent put it, the books were "ingraining the old race-riot type of fear." As such letters became more frequent, Grosset & Dunlap informed the Stratemeyer Syndicate that the books must be revised and such stereotypes excised. The end result, however, was less the removal of stereotypes than the removal of non-white characters altogether and the creation of an "ethnically cleansed Bayport." By the 1970s, however, the series began to re-introduce black characters.

An additional rationale for the revisions was a drop in sales, which became particularly significant by the mid-1960s. Accordingly, the revisions focused on streamlining the texts, as well as eliminating stereotypes. The books were shortened from 25 chapters to 20 and the writing style was made terser. Difficult vocabulary words such as "ostensible" and "presaged" were eliminated, as was slang. As a result of the new, more streamlined writing style, the books focus more on non-stop action than on building atmosphere, and "prolonged suspense [is] evaporated." The books were also aimed at an increasingly younger audience with shorter attention spans. For this reason, many commentators find the new versions nothing less than "eviscerated", foremost among them being the first "Hardy Boys" ghostwriter, Leslie McFarlane, who agreed with a reporter's statement that the books had been "gutted."

In the course of revising and modernizing the series, many plots were completely re-written. "<a href="The%20Flickering%20Torch%20Mystery">The Flickering Torch Mystery</a>" (1943), for example, was changed from a plot involving an actual flickering torch used as a signal by a gang to a plot featuring a rock club called "The Flickering Torch." When plots were kept, their more lurid elements were eliminated; Vilnoff, the villain in "The Sinister Sign-Post", was changed from a criminal who compulsively sculpts miniature models of his own hands to a car thief without such eccentricities, and another villain, Pedro Vincenzo, who branded his victims no longer does so in the revised version of "The Mark on the Door" (1934, rev. 1967).

The books became more respectful of law and authority. Even villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes involving guns and shoot-outs were compressed or eliminated, in favor of criminals simply giving themselves up. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and of the law; for example, they no longer drive faster than the speed limit even in pursuit of a villain. The Hardys also became more and more wealthy, prompting the criticism that the "major problem in [these volumes] is that the Hardy Boys have risen above any ability to identify with people like the typical boys who read their books. They are members and agents of the adult ruling class, acting on behalf of that ruling class."

The "Hardy Boys" began to be published in paperback in 1979. The Hardys were also featured in two new series, the "<a href="Hardy%20Boys%20Casefiles">Hardy Boys Casefiles</a>" and the "<a href="Clues%20Brothers">Clues Brothers</a>". The latter series, modeled on the <a href="Nancy%20Drew%20Notebooks">Nancy Drew Notebooks</a>, was aimed at a younger audience, and ran from 1997 to 2000. In contrast, the "Casefiles", begun a decade earlier in 1987, was aimed at an older audience than the "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories". In the new series, the Hardys' work with a secret <a href="government%20organization">government organization</a> simply called the "Network", with which they collaborate to "infiltrate organized crime, battle terrorists and track down assassins around the world." The Hardys' personalities are portrayed as more separate and distinct, and they sometimes fight; in the first of the series, "<a href="Dead%20on%20Target%20%28The%20Hardy%20Boys%29">Dead on Target</a>", for example, the brothers brawl after Frank tries to restrain Joe after Joe's girlfriend, Iola Morton, is killed by a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a>. In general, the series is more violent, and the Hardy Boys carry various guns; Lines like "Joe! Hand me the <a href="Uzi">Uzi</a>!" are not out of character. Barbara Steiner, a Casefiles ghostwriter, describes a sample plot outline: "I was told that Joe Hardy would get involved with a waitress, a black widow kind of character, and that Joe would get arrested for murder. I was told the emphasis was on high action and suspense and there had to be a cliff-hanger ending to every chapter."

The long-running "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories" series ended in 2005 and was replaced with a <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> series, "<a href="Undercover%20Brothers">The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers</a>". In these volumes, the Hardys' adventures are narrated in the first person, each brother alternating chapters. This fresh approach to telling the adventures reveals two boys quite foreign to how they have been portrayed before, egotistical and jealous, and longtime readers will find few connections with the boys' previous personalities. The boys' <a href="Aunt%20Gertrude">Aunt Gertrude</a> becomes "Trudy", their mother Laura is given a career as a librarian, and their father is <a href="semi-retired">semi-retired</a>. The boys are given their cases by a secret group known as ATAC, an acronym for <a href="American%20Teens%20Against%20Crime">American Teens Against Crime</a>. In this new series, the Hardy Boys seem "more like regular kids – who have "lots" of wild adventures – in these books, which also deal with issues that kids today might have thought about. For example, the second book in the series, "Running on Fumes", deals with environmentalists who go a little too far to try to save trees." The Hardys are also featured in a new <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> series, begun in 2005 and produced by <a href="Papercutz%20%28publisher%29">Papercutz</a>, and a new early chapter book series called "The Hardy Boys: Secret Files", begun in 2010 by the publisher <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> under their Aladdin imprint. The last "Undercover Brothers" books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 ("Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery '07" series). At the time of cancellation, there was one book that had been announced, but was ultimately shelved ("The Case Of The MyFace Kidnapper"); it is unknown whether this was going to be the final title of this unpublished book, since many bookstore websites and Simon & Schuster's website always had the letters "W.T." behind the title, meaning that it was a "<a href="working%20title">working title</a>."

February 2013 saw the launch of "The Hardy Boys Adventures", a series written in the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first-person</a>. For the first time since 1985, the books will be issued in hardcover, along with paperback editions.

The longest-running series of books to feature the Hardy Boys is the "Hardy Boys Mystery Stories", sometimes also called the "Hardy Boys Mysteries". The series ran from 1927 to 2005 and comprises 190 volumes, although some consider only the first 58 volumes of this series to be part of the Hardy Boys "<a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>." The Hardy Boys also appeared in 127 volumes of the "Casefiles" series and 39 volumes of the "Undercover Brothers" series, and are currently the heroes of the "Hardy Boys Adventures" series. The brothers were also featured in a few standalone books, such as "The Hardy Boys Ghost Stories", and some crossover titles where they teamed up with other characters such as Nancy Drew or <a href="Tom%20Swift">Tom Swift</a>.

"Hardy Boys" books have been extensively reprinted in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, with new illustrations and <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a>. The Hardys' adventures have also been translated into over twenty-five languages, including <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a>, <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>. The books are widely read in India, and Japan's <a href="Kyoto%20Sangyo%20University">Kyoto Sangyo University</a> listed twenty-one "Hardy Boys" books on its reading list for freshmen in the 1990s.

There have been five separate "Hardy Boys" television adaptations. 

In the late 1950s, <a href="Disney">Disney</a> contracted with the <a href="Stratemeyer%20Syndicate">Stratemeyer Syndicate</a> and <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a> to produce two "Hardy Boys" <a href="Serial%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">TV serials</a>, starring <a href="Tim%20Considine">Tim Considine</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Kirk">Tommy Kirk</a>. The first of the serials, "The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure", was aired on "<a href="The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>" in 1956 during the show's second season. To appeal to the show's audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than in the books, seeming to be twelve or thirteen years old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by <a href="Jackson%20Gillis">Jackson Gillis</a>, was based on the first "Hardy Boys" book, "<a href="The%20Tower%20Treasure">The Tower Treasure</a>", and the serial was aired in 19 episodes of fifteen minutes each with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, "The Mystery of Ghost Farm", followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.

In the mid-1960s, sales of "Hardy Boys" books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate conducted a survey, which revealed that the decline in sales was due to the perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on "<a href="The%20Mystery%20of%20the%20Chinese%20Junk">The Mystery of the Chinese Junk</a>", was aired on the <a href="National%20Broadcasting%20Company">National Broadcasting Company</a> (NBC) on September 8, 1967 and starred <a href="Tim%20Matheson">Tim Matthieson</a> (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were twenty at the time of production and portrayed the Hardy Boys as young adults rather than children. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.

Two years later, in 1969, the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> aired a <a href="Saturday%20morning%20cartoon">Saturday morning cartoon</a> series based on the "Hardy Boys"; the series was produced by <a href="Filmation">Filmation</a> and ran from 1969 to 1971. In this series, the Hardys were members of a <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> band. A group of professional musicians performed all the songs on the series, and toured across the United States. The <a href="animated%20series">animated series</a> produced two <a href="bubblegum%20music">bubblegum music</a> albums "of moderate quality with no commercial success." The series was notable for being the first cartoon to include a black character. The show took note of current concerns; although aimed at a young audience, some plot lines dealt with illegal drugs, and the animated Frank and Joe spoke directly to children about not smoking and the importance of wearing seat belts.

ABC aired another series featuring the Hardy Boys, "<a href="The%20Hardy%20Boys/Nancy%20Drew%20Mysteries">The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries</a>", from 1977 to 1979. The prime time series starred <a href="Parker%20Stevenson">Parker Stevenson</a> and <a href="Shaun%20Cassidy">Shaun Cassidy</a> as Frank and Joe Hardy; <a href="Pamela%20Sue%20Martin">Pamela Sue Martin</a> and later <a href="Janet%20Louise%20Johnson">Janet Louise Johnson</a> played <a href="Nancy%20Drew">Nancy Drew</a>. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes featuring the Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively during the filming of the first episodes). The series featured original plots as well as ones based on "Hardy Boys" books, among them "<a href="The%20Clue%20of%20the%20Screeching%20Owl">The Clue of the Screeching Owl</a>", "<a href="The%20Disappearing%20Floor">The Disappearing Floor</a>" and "<a href="The%20Flickering%20Torch%20Mystery">The Flickering Torch Mystery</a>". The series received an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a> nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including <a href="Kim%20Cattrall">Kim Cattrall</a>, <a href="Ray%20Milland">Ray Milland</a>, <a href="Howard%20Duff">Howard Duff</a>, and <a href="Ricky%20Nelson">Ricky Nelson</a>. During the second season, the series format changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin quit and was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to "The Hardy Boys".

In 1995, another TV adaptation, simply called "<a href="The%20Hardy%20Boys%20%281995%20TV%20series%29">The Hardy Boys</a>" was produced by Canadian company <a href="Nelvana">Nelvana</a> (normally an animation firm), syndicated by <a href="New%20Line%20Television">New Line Television</a>, and was dubbed in French for airing in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="France">France</a> as well as in the United States. <a href="Colin%20Keith%20Gray">Colin Gray</a> starred as Frank Hardy and <a href="Paul%20Popowich">Paul Popowich</a> played Joe. The characters were portrayed as in their early twenties, Frank working as a reporter and Joe still in college. The show lasted for only one season of thirteen episodes due to poor ratings; a series based on "Nancy Drew" that ran alongside it in syndication suffered the same fate.

Several Hardy Boys video games have been released:


In March, 2017 <a href="Dynamite%20Entertainment">Dynamite Entertainment</a> released <a href="Anthony%20Del%20Col">Anthony Del Col</a>’s reboot of classic characters Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys with "NANCY DREW & THE HARDY BOYS: THE BIG LIE". Del Col has been a lifelong fan of the characters and was successful in working with Simon & Schuster to secure the comic book rights and then pitch to publishers.
Inspired by Archie Comics’ "Afterlife with Archie", Del Col is quoted as saying, “So, then I started to think, 'Huh, I wonder what other characters are out there that are well-known that could be rebooted like that,'" Del Col said. "That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' ”
The series, a hardboiled noir take on the characters, finds characters Frank and Joe Hardy accused of murdering their father, Fenton Hardy, and turning to a femme fatale-esque Nancy Drew to clear their names. The series features artwork by Italian artist Werther Dell’Ederra with covers by UK artist Fay Dalton. Del Col credits editors Matt Idelson and Matt Humphreys with helping him shape the direction of the series.
The series debuted to amazing reviews. Comics blog Readingwithaflightring.com declared it, “the best 'modern' approach to updating a franchise like this that I’ve seen. It works on every level and still fully embraces the heart of who they are." Aintitcool.com reviewer Lyz Reblin stated, “The strength of the series thus far is Ms. Drew, who was absent for most of the first issue. She is a pitch-perfect modernized femme fatale, who could hold her own up against any present-day Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, or the like.”


The Hardy Boys have been called "a cultural touchstone all over the world." Their adventures have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold, and as of 2008 the books were selling over a million copies a year (the first "Hardy Boys" book, "The Tower Treasure", alone sells over 100,000 copies a year). Worldwide, over 70 million copies of Hardy Books have been sold. A number of critics have tried to explain the reasons for the characters' longevity.

One explanation for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple <a href="wish%20fulfillment">wish fulfillment</a>. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience an escape from the mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they "set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males", part of the "cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man." More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She tries to argue that "racist stereotypes are ... fundamental to the success of the "Hardy Boys" series." In support of this claim, Wood cites what she says is the replacement of one stereotype (evil <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese</a>) with another (evil <a href="Latin%20Americans">Latin Americans</a>) in the original and revised versions of "Footprints Under the Window". She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the <a href="Applewood%20Books">Applewood Books</a> reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather that the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.

Critic <a href="Gary%20Westfahl">Gary Westfahl</a> considers the Hardy Boys to not display any sexuality. The Hardys' ignorance of sex and their increasing respect for the law have led to some negative perceptions and many parodies of the characters. They are "well-scrubbed Boy Scout types" who "fetishized squareness." They have been parodied numerous times, in such works as "The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From" by <a href="Christopher%20Durang">Christopher Durang</a>, "The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical" by Timothy Cope and Paul Boesing, and Mabel Maney's novel "A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery". "<a href="National%20Lampoon%20%28magazine%29">National Lampoon</a>" ran an article in 1985 entitled "The Undiscovered Notebooks of Franklin W. Dixon", in which the authors "purport to have stumbled upon some unpublished "Hardy Boys" manuscripts", including "The Party Boys and the Case of the Missing Scotch" and "The Hardly Boys in the Dark Secret of the Spooky Closet." It should be noted, however, that the original series contained references to the attraction felt by Frank and Joe to the female leads.

Others have pointed to the Hardy Boys' relationship with their father as a key to the success of the series. As Tim Morris notes, while <a href="Fenton%20Hardy">Fenton Hardy</a> is portrayed as a great detective, his sons are usually the ones that solve cases, making Fenton Hardy a <a href="paradoxical">paradoxical</a> figure:

He is always there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is typically emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He can take on any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a "Hardy Boys" novel begins, which is of course the only time we ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his <a href="case%20notes">case notes</a>, his <a href="ciphers">ciphers</a>, his <a href="microfilm">microfilm</a>, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to <a href="Canada">Canada</a> or <a href="Florida">Florida</a> or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.

As a result, the Hardy Boys are able both to be superior to their father and to gain the satisfaction of "fearlessly making their dad proud of them."

In the end, many commentators find that the Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent "a victory over anxiety." The "Hardy Boys" series teaches readers that "although the world can be an out-of-control place, good "can" triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others."
