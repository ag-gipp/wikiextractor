DNA repair

DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> identifies and corrects damage to the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> molecules that encode its <a href="genome">genome</a>. In human cells, both normal <a href="metabolism">metabolic</a> activities and environmental factors such as <a href="radiation">radiation</a> can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 <a href="million">million</a> individual <a href="molecular%20lesion">molecular lesion</a>s per cell per day. Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell's ability to <a href="Transcription%20%28biology%29">transcribe</a> the <a href="gene">gene</a> that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s in the cell's genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure. When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur, including double-strand breaks and <a href="Crosslinking%20of%20DNA">DNA crosslinkages</a> (interstrand crosslinks or ICLs). This can eventually lead to malignant tumors, or <a href="cancer">cancer</a> as per the <a href="Knudson%20hypothesis">two hit hypothesis</a>.

The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors, including the cell type, the age of the cell, and the extracellular environment. A cell that has accumulated a large amount of DNA damage, or one that no longer effectively repairs damage incurred to its DNA, can enter one of three possible states:

The DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism. Many genes that were initially shown to influence <a href="life%20expectancy">life span</a> have turned out to be involved in DNA damage repair and protection.
The 2015 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> was awarded to <a href="Tomas%20Lindahl">Tomas Lindahl</a>, <a href="Paul%20Modrich">Paul Modrich</a>, and <a href="Aziz%20Sancar">Aziz Sancar</a> for their work on the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair processes.

DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal <a href="metabolism">metabolic</a> processes inside the cell, occurs at a rate of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as <a href="tumor%20suppressor%20gene">tumor suppressor gene</a>s) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of <a href="tumor">tumor</a> formation and contribute to <a href="tumour%20heterogeneity">tumour heterogeneity</a>.

The vast majority of DNA damage affects the <a href="primary%20structure">primary structure</a> of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules' regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>, DNA usually lacks <a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary structure</a> and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, <a href="supercoil">supercoil</a>ed and wound around "packaging" proteins called <a href="histone">histone</a>s (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.

DNA damage can be subdivided into two main types:


The replication of damaged DNA before cell division can lead to the incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones. Daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which the original DNA sequence is unrecoverable (except in the rare case of a <a href="Mutation%23By%20effect%20on%20function">back mutation</a>, for example, through <a href="gene%20conversion">gene conversion</a>).

There are several types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes:

Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms. Some examples are:

UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage. Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base, deamination, sugar <a href="ring%20pucker">ring pucker</a>ing and tautomeric shift.

In human cells, and <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> cells in general, DNA is found in two cellular locations – inside the <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> and inside the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a> during non-replicative stages of the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> and is condensed into aggregate structures known as <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a> during <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called <a href="histones">histones</a>. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria <a href="organelles">organelles</a>, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> (ROS), or <a href="radical%20%28chemistry%29">free radicals</a>, byproducts of the constant production of <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP) via <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>, which is present in both the mitochondria and <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> of eukaryotic cells.

Senescence, an irreversible process in which the cell no longer <a href="mitosis">divides</a>, is a protective response to the shortening of the <a href="telomeres">chromosome ends</a>. The telomeres are long regions of repetitive <a href="noncoding%20DNA">noncoding DNA</a> that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division (see <a href="Hayflick%20limit">Hayflick limit</a>). In contrast, <a href="G0%20phase">quiescence</a> is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage (see <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>). Senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism, which serves as a "last resort" mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro-growth <a href="cellular%20signaling">cellular signaling</a>. Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor (see <a href="cancer">cancer</a>), which is potentially lethal to an organism. Therefore, the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered to be part of a strategy of protection against cancer.

It is important to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of error in DNA. DNA damage and mutation are fundamentally different. Damage results in physical abnormalities in the DNA, such as single- and double-strand breaks, <a href="8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine">8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine</a> residues, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired if redundant information, such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome, is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented, and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked or the cell may die.

In contrast to DNA damage, a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.

Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these errors are a major source of mutation.

Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation, it can be seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.

Cells cannot function if DNA damage corrupts the integrity and accessibility of essential information in the <a href="genome">genome</a> (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending on the type of damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister <a href="chromatid">chromatid</a> as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as <a href="DNA%20repair%23Translesion%20synthesis">translesion synthesis</a> as a last resort.

Damage to DNA alters the spatial configuration of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind at or near the site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.

Cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of the four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of <a href="pyrimidine%20dimer">pyrimidine dimer</a>s upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The <a href="photoreactivation">photoreactivation</a> process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme <a href="photolyase">photolyase</a>, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">blue/UV light</a> (300–500 nm <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, and most <a href="animals">animals</a> no longer functions in humans, who instead use <a href="nucleotide%20excision%20repair">nucleotide excision repair</a> to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called <a href="ogt">ogt</a>. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is <a href="stoichiometric">stoichiometric</a> rather than <a href="catalytic">catalytic</a>. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the <a href="adaptive%20response">adaptive response</a> and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.

When only one of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand can be used as a template to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of <a href="excision%20repair">excision repair</a> mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.

Double-strand breaks, in which both strands in the double helix are severed, are particularly hazardous to the cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements. It was noted in some studies that double-strand breaks and a "cross-linkage joining both strands at the same point is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair. The cell will die in the next mitosis or in some rare instances, mutate." Three mechanisms exist to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs): <a href="non-homologous%20end%20joining">non-homologous end joining</a> (NHEJ), <a href="microhomology-mediated%20end%20joining">microhomology-mediated end joining</a> (MMEJ), and <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a> (HR). In an "in vitro" system, MMEJ occurred in mammalian cells at the levels of 10–20% of HR when both HR and NHEJ mechanisms were also available.
In NHEJ, <a href="LIG4">DNA Ligase IV</a>, a specialized <a href="DNA%20ligase">DNA ligase</a> that forms a complex with the cofactor <a href="XRCC4">XRCC4</a>, directly joins the two ends. To guide accurate repair, NHEJ relies on short homologous sequences called microhomologies present on the single-stranded tails of the DNA ends to be joined. If these overhangs are compatible, repair is usually accurate. NHEJ can also introduce mutations during repair. Loss of damaged nucleotides at the break site can lead to deletions, and joining of nonmatching termini forms insertions or translocations. NHEJ is especially important before the cell has replicated its DNA, since there is no template available for repair by homologous recombination. There are "backup" NHEJ pathways in higher <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s. Besides its role as a genome caretaker, NHEJ is required for joining hairpin-capped double-strand breaks induced during <a href="V%28D%29J%20recombination">V(D)J recombination</a>, the process that generates diversity in <a href="B-cell%20receptor">B-cell</a> and <a href="T-cell%20receptor">T-cell receptor</a>s in the <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>.

Homologous recombination requires the presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as a template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for <a href="chromosomal%20crossover">chromosomal crossover</a> during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister <a href="chromatid">chromatid</a> (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a <a href="homologous%20chromosome">homologous chromosome</a> as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the <a href="replication%20fork">replication fork</a> and are typically repaired by recombination.

MMEJ starts with short-range end resection by <a href="MRE11">MRE11</a> nuclease on either side of a double-strand break to reveal microhomology regions. In further steps, <a href="PARP1">Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1</a> (PARP1) is required and may be an early step in MMEJ. There is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of <a href="flap%20structure-specific%20endonuclease%201">flap structure-specific endonuclease 1</a> (FEN1) to remove overhanging flaps. This is followed by recruitment of <a href="XRCC1">XRCC1</a>–<a href="LIG3">LIG3</a> to the site for ligating the DNA ends, leading to an intact DNA. MMEJ is always accompanied by a deletion, so that MMEJ is a mutagenic pathway for DNA repair.

The <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a> "<a href="Deinococcus%20radiodurans">Deinococcus radiodurans</a>" has a remarkable ability to survive DNA damage from <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a> and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through <a href="Annealing%20%28biology%29">annealing</a>. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29%23Homology%20of%20sequences%20in%20genetics">homologous</a> regions through a moving <a href="D-loop">D-loop</a> that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is <a href="Chromosomal%20crossover">crossover</a> by means of <a href="RecA">RecA</a>-dependent <a href="Homologous%20recombination%23RecBCD%20pathway">homologous recombination</a>.

<a href="Topoisomerase">Topoisomerase</a>s introduce both single- and double-strand breaks in the course of changing the DNA's state of <a href="supercoil">supercoil</a>ing, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.

Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a> machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as <a href="thymine%20dimer">thymine dimer</a>s or <a href="AP%20site">AP site</a>s. It involves switching out regular <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>s for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication <a href="processivity">processivity</a> factor <a href="PCNA">PCNA</a>. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, <a href="DNA%20polymerase%20eta">Pol η</a> mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by <a href="ultraviolet">UV irradiation</a>, whereas <a href="POLI">Pol ι</a> introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the <a href="Pyrimidine%20dimers%23Mutagenesis">T^T photodimer</a> using <a href="Base%20pair">Watson-Crick base pairing</a> and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using <a href="Hoogsteen%20base%20pair">Hoogsteen base pair</a>ing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a>s during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized <a href="polymerases">polymerases</a> either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, G[8,5-Me]T, although it can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in "Escherichia coli" by replicating a G[8,5-Me]T-modified plasmid in "E. coli" with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.
A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by <a href="Proliferating%20cell%20nuclear%20antigen">Proliferating cell nuclear antigen</a> (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At a site of <a href="lesion">lesion</a>, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/<a href="RAD18">RAD18</a> <a href="proteins">proteins</a> to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, as in the case of Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; <a href="DNA%20polymerase%23Polymerases%20Rev1%20and%20%CE%B6%20%28zeta%29">Pol ζ</a>. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.

Cells exposed to <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a>, <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a> or chemicals are prone to acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the <a href="replication%20fork">replication fork</a>s, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>. The common features of global response are induction of multiple <a href="gene">gene</a>s, <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> arrest, and inhibition of <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>.

The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a> presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action. To allow DNA repair, the chromatin must be <a href="chromatin%20remodeling">remodeled</a>. In eukaryotes, <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> dependent <a href="chromatin%20remodeling">chromatin remodeling</a> complexes and <a href="histone-modifying%20enzymes">histone-modifying enzymes</a> are two predominant factors employed to accomplish this remodeling process.

Chromatin relaxation occurs rapidly at the site of a DNA damage. In one of the earliest steps, the stress-activated protein kinase, <a href="c-Jun%20N-terminal%20kinases">c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)</a>, phosphorylates <a href="SIRT6">SIRT6</a> on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks or other DNA damage. This <a href="post-translational%20modification">post-translational modification</a> facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites, and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. <a href="PARP1">PARP1</a> protein starts to appear at DNA damage sites in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs. PARP1 synthesizes <a href="polymeric">polymeric</a> <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate%20ribose">adenosine diphosphate ribose</a> (poly (ADP-ribose) or PAR) chains on itself. Next the chromatin remodeler <a href="CHD1L">ALC1</a> quickly attaches to the product of PARP1 action, a poly-ADP ribose chain, and ALC1 completes arrival at the DNA damage within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the damage. About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of ALC1, occurs by 10 seconds. This then allows recruitment of the DNA repair enzyme <a href="MRE11A">MRE11</a>, to initiate DNA repair, within 13 seconds.

γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of <a href="H2AFX">H2AX</a> is also involved in the early steps leading to chromatin decondensation after DNA double-strand breaks. The <a href="histone">histone</a> variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139) can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of γH2AX occurs in one minute. The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs at the site of a DNA double-strand break. γH2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of irradiation, <a href="RNF8">RNF8</a> protein can be detected in association with γH2AX. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with <a href="CHD4">CHD4</a>, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex <a href="Mi-2/NuRD%20complex">NuRD</a>.

<a href="DDB2">DDB2</a> occurs in a heterodimeric complex with <a href="DDB1">DDB1</a>. This complex further complexes with the <a href="ubiquitin%20ligase">ubiquitin ligase</a> protein <a href="CUL4A">CUL4A</a> and with <a href="PARP1">PARP1</a>. This larger complex rapidly associates with UV-induced damage within chromatin, with half-maximum association completed in 40 seconds. The PARP1 protein, attached to both DDB1 and DDB2, then <a href="ADP-ribosylation%23Poly%20ADP-ribosylation">PARylates</a> (creates a poly-ADP ribose chain) on DDB2 that attracts the DNA remodeling protein <a href="CHD1L">ALC1</a>. Action of ALC1 relaxes the chromatin at the site of UV damage to DNA. This relaxation allows other proteins in the <a href="nucleotide%20excision%20repair">nucleotide excision repair</a> pathway to enter the chromatin and repair UV-induced <a href="Pyrimidine%20dimer">cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer</a> damages.

After rapid <a href="chromatin%20remodeling">chromatin remodeling</a>, <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> <a href="cell%20cycle%20checkpoint">checkpoints</a> are activated to allow DNA repair to occur before the cell cycle progresses. First, two <a href="kinase">kinase</a>s, <a href="ataxia%20telangiectasia%20mutated">ATM</a> and <a href="Ataxia%20Telangiectasia%20and%20Rad3%20related">ATR</a> are activated within 5 or 6 minutes after DNA is damaged. This is followed by phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein <a href="CHEK1">Chk1</a>, initiating its function, about 10 minutes after DNA is damaged.

After DNA damage, <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> <a href="cell%20cycle%20checkpoint">checkpoints</a> are activated. Checkpoint activation pauses the cell cycle and gives the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the <a href="G1%20phase">G1</a>/<a href="S%20phase">S</a> and <a href="G2%20phase">G2</a>/<a href="mitosis">M</a> boundaries. An intra-<a href="S%20phase">S</a> checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master <a href="kinase">kinase</a>s, <a href="ataxia%20telangiectasia%20mutated">ATM</a> and <a href="Ataxia%20Telangiectasia%20and%20Rad3%20related">ATR</a>. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled <a href="replication%20fork">replication fork</a>s. These kinases <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylate</a> downstream targets in a <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a> cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including <a href="BRCA1">BRCA1</a>, <a href="MDC1">MDC1</a>, and <a href="53BP1">53BP1</a> has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.

DNA damage checkpoint is a <a href="signal%20transduction%20pathway">signal transduction pathway</a> that blocks <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> progression in G1, G2 and <a href="metaphase">metaphase</a> and slows down the rate of S phase progression when <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide.

Checkpoint Proteins can be separated into four groups: <a href="phosphatidylinositol%203-kinase">phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase</a> (PI3K)-like <a href="protein%20kinase">protein kinase</a>, <a href="proliferating%20cell%20nuclear%20antigen">proliferating cell nuclear antigen</a> (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses is a pair of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (<a href="Ataxia%20telangiectasia%20mutated">Ataxia telangiectasia mutated</a>) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.

An important downstream target of ATM and ATR is <a href="p53">p53</a>, as it is required for inducing <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> following DNA damage. The <a href="cyclin-dependent%20kinase%20inhibitor">cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor</a> <a href="p21">p21</a> is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating <a href="cyclin">cyclin</a>/<a href="cyclin-dependent%20kinase">cyclin-dependent kinase</a> complexes.

The <a href="SOS%20response">SOS response</a> is the changes in <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The <a href="prokaryotic">prokaryotic</a> SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: <a href="LexA">LexA</a> and <a href="RecA">RecA</a>. The LexA <a href="homodimer">homodimer</a> is a <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a>al <a href="repressor">repressor</a> that binds to <a href="operator%20%28biology%29">operator</a> sequences commonly referred to as SOS boxes. In "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS response is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the <a href="Spirochetes">Spirochetes</a>.
The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled <a href="replication%20fork">replication fork</a>s or double-strand breaks, which are processed by <a href="DNA%20helicase">DNA helicase</a> to separate the two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an <a href="ATP%20hydrolysis">ATP hydrolysis</a> driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA auto<a href="protease">protease</a> activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.

In "Escherichia coli", SOS boxes are 20-nucleotide long sequences near promoters with <a href="palindromic">palindromic</a> structure and a high degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.

<a href="Eukaryotic">Eukaryotic</a> cells exposed to DNA damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, <a href="cell%20cycle%20checkpoint">cell cycle checkpoint</a> control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of <a href="yeast">yeast</a> "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>" to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental <a href="shock%20response">shock response</a> indicates that a general global stress response pathway exist at the level of transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the <a href="heterogeneity">heterogeneity</a> of <a href="mammalian">mammalian</a> cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.

In general global response to DNA damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for <a href="postreplication%20repair">postreplication repair</a>, homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, <a href="DNA%20damage%20checkpoint">DNA damage checkpoint</a>, global transcriptional activation, genes controlling mRNA decay, and many others. A large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision: undergo apoptosis and die, or survive at the cost of living with a modified genome. An increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations. Yeast Rev1 and human polymerase η are members of [Y family translesion DNA <a href="polymerase">polymerase</a>s present during global response to DNA damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to DNA damage in eukaryotes.

Experimental animals with genetic deficiencies in DNA repair often show decreased life span and increased cancer incidence. For example, mice deficient in the dominant NHEJ pathway and in telomere maintenance mechanisms get <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> and infections more often, and, as a consequence, have shorter lifespans than wild-type mice. In similar manner, mice deficient in a key repair and transcription protein that unwinds DNA helices have premature onset of aging-related diseases and consequent shortening of lifespan. However, not every DNA repair deficiency creates exactly the predicted effects; mice deficient in the NER pathway exhibited shortened life span without correspondingly higher rates of mutation.

If the rate of DNA damage exceeds the capacity of the cell to repair it, the accumulation of errors can overwhelm the cell and result in early senescence, apoptosis, or cancer. Inherited diseases associated with faulty DNA repair functioning result in premature aging, increased sensitivity to carcinogens, and correspondingly increased cancer risk (see <a href="DNA%20repair%23Medicine%20and%20DNA%20repair%20modulation">below</a>). On the other hand, organisms with enhanced DNA repair systems, such as "<a href="Deinococcus%20radiodurans">Deinococcus radiodurans</a>", the most radiation-resistant known organism, exhibit remarkable resistance to the double-strand break-inducing effects of <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>, likely due to enhanced efficiency of DNA repair and especially NHEJ.

A number of individual genes have been identified as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms. The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment, in particular, on the organism's diet. <a href="Caloric%20restriction">Caloric restriction</a> reproducibly results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms, likely via <a href="nutrient%20sensing">nutrient sensing</a> pathways and decreased <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a>. The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear (see for some discussion); however, the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction. Several agents reported to have anti-aging properties have been shown to attenuate constitutive level of <a href="mTOR">mTOR</a> signaling, an evidence of reduction of <a href="metabolic%20activity">metabolic activity</a>, and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of <a href="DNA%20damage">DNA damage</a> induced by endogenously generated reactive oxygen species.
For example, increasing the <a href="gene%20dosage">gene dosage</a> of the gene SIR-2, which regulates DNA packaging in the nematode worm "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">Caenorhabditis elegans</a>", can significantly extend lifespan. The mammalian homolog of SIR-2 is known to induce downstream DNA repair factors involved in NHEJ, an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction. Caloric restriction has been closely linked to the rate of base excision repair in the nuclear DNA of rodents, although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial DNA.

The "C. elegans" gene AGE-1, an upstream effector of DNA repair pathways, confers dramatically extended life span under free-feeding conditions but leads to a decrease in reproductive fitness under conditions of caloric restriction. This observation supports the <a href="pleiotropy">pleiotropy</a> theory of the <a href="senescence%23Theories%20of%20aging">biological origins of aging</a>, which suggests that genes conferring a large survival advantage early in life will be selected for even if they carry a corresponding disadvantage late in life.

Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for several genetic disorders, including:


Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders, suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons.

Other DNA repair disorders include:


All of the above diseases are often called "segmental <a href="progeria">progeria</a>s" ("<a href="accelerated%20aging%20disease">accelerated aging disease</a>s") because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging-related diseases at an abnormally young age, while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age.

Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include <a href="Fanconi%20anemia">Fanconi anemia</a>, hereditary <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> and hereditary <a href="colon%20cancer">colon cancer</a>.

Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. There are at least 34 <a href="Inherited%20human%20DNA%20repair%20gene%20mutations%20that%20increase%20cancer%20risk">Inherited human DNA repair gene mutations that increase cancer risk</a>. Many of these mutations cause DNA repair to be less effective than normal. In particular, <a href="Hereditary%20nonpolyposis%20colorectal%20cancer">Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</a> (HNPCC) is strongly associated with specific mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway. "<a href="BRCA1">BRCA1</a>" and "<a href="BRCA2">BRCA2</a>", two important genes whose mutations confer a hugely increased risk of breast cancer on carriers, are both associated with a large number of DNA repair pathways, especially NHEJ and homologous recombination.

Cancer therapy procedures such as <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> work by overwhelming the capacity of the cell to repair DNA damage, resulting in cell death. Cells that are most rapidly dividing – most typically cancer cells – are preferentially affected. The side-effect is that other non-cancerous but rapidly dividing cells such as progenitor cells in the gut, skin, and hematopoietic system are also affected. Modern cancer treatments attempt to localize the DNA damage to cells and tissues only associated with cancer, either by physical means (concentrating the therapeutic agent in the region of the tumor) or by biochemical means (exploiting a feature unique to cancer cells in the body). ...; in the context of therapies targeting DNA damage response genes, the latter approach has been termed 'synthetic lethality'.

Perhaps the most well-known of these 'synthetic lethality' drugs is the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (<a href="PARP1">PARP1</a>) inhibitor <a href="olaparib">olaparib</a>, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for the treatment in women of BRCA-defective ovarian cancer. Tumor cells with partial loss of DNA damage response (specifically, <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a> repair) are dependent on another mechanism – single-strand break repair – which is a mechanism consisting, in part, of the PARP1 gene product. <a href="Olaparib">Olaparib</a> is combined with chemotherapeutics to inhibit single-strand break repair induced by DNA damage caused by the co-administered chemotherapy. Tumor cells relying on this residual DNA repair mechanism are unable to repair the damage and hence are not able to survive and proliferate, whereas normal cells can repair the damage with the functioning homologous recombination mechanism.

Many other drugs for use against other residual DNA repair mechanisms commonly found in cancer are currently under investigation. However, synthetic lethality therapeutic approaches have been questioned due to emerging evidence of acquired resistance, achieved through rewiring of DNA damage response pathways and reversion of previously-inhibited defects.

It has become apparent over the past several years that the DNA damage response acts as a barrier to the malignant transformation of preneoplastic cells. Previous studies have shown an elevated DNA damage response in cell-culture models with oncogene activation and preneoplastic colon adenomas. DNA damage response mechanisms trigger cell-cycle arrest, and attempt to repair DNA lesions or promote cell death/senescence if repair is not possible. Replication stress is observed in preneoplastic cells due to increased proliferation signals from oncogenic mutations. Replication stress is characterized by: increased replication initiation/origin firing; increased transcription and collisions of transcription-replication complexes; nucleotide deficiency; increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Replication stress, along with the selection for inactivating mutations in DNA damage response genes in the evolution of the tumor, leads to downregulation and/or loss of some DNA damage response mechanisms, and hence loss of DNA repair and/or senescence/programmed cell death. In experimental mouse models, loss of DNA damage response-mediated cell senescence was observed after using a <a href="short%20hairpin%20RNA">short hairpin RNA</a> (shRNA) to inhibit the double-strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia (<a href="ATM%20serine/threonine%20kinase">ATM</a>), leading to increased tumor size and invasiveness. Humans born with inherited defects in DNA repair mechanisms (for example, <a href="Li-Fraumeni%20syndrome">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</a>) have a higher cancer risk.

The prevalence of DNA damage response mutations differs across cancer types; for example, 30% of breast invasive carcinomas have mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination. In cancer, downregulation is observed across all DNA damage response mechanisms (base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination repair (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). As well as mutations to DNA damage repair genes, mutations also arise in the genes responsible for arresting the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> to allow sufficient time for DNA repair to occur, and some genes are involved in both DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint control, for example ATM and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) – a tumor suppressor that is often absent or downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer.

Table: Genes involved in DNA damage response pathways and frequently mutated in cancer (HR = homologous recombination; NHEJ = non-homologous end joining; SSA = single-strand annealing; FA = fanconi anemia pathway; BER = base excision repair; NER = nucleotide excision repair; MMR = mismatch repair)

Classically, cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and chromosomal aberrations. However, it has become apparent that cancer is also driven by
<a href="Epigenetics">epigenetic alterations</a>.

Epigenetic alterations refer to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in <a href="DNA%20methylation">DNA methylation</a> (hypermethylation and hypomethylation) and <a href="histone%20modification">histone modification</a>, changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as <a href="HMGA2">HMGA2</a> or <a href="HMGA1">HMGA1</a>) and changes caused by <a href="microRNA">microRNA</a>s. Each of these epigenetic alterations serves to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>. These changes usually remain through <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>s, last for multiple cell generations, and can be considered to be epimutations (equivalent to mutations).

While large numbers of epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, appear to be particularly important. Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the <a href="Genome%20instability">genetic</a> instability characteristic of cancers.

Reduced expression of DNA repair genes causes deficient DNA repair. When DNA repair is deficient DNA damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation. Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in <a href="DNA%20mismatch%20repair">DNA mismatch repair</a> or in <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a>al repair (HRR). Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.

Higher levels of DNA damage not only cause increased mutation, but also cause increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing.

Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause increased risk of cancer. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article <a href="DNA%20repair-deficiency%20disorder">DNA repair-deficiency disorder</a>) have an increased risk of cancer, with some defects causing up to a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations). However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.

Deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes are occasionally caused by a newly arising somatic mutation in a DNA repair gene, but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. For example, when 113 colorectal cancers were examined in sequence, only four had a <a href="missense%20mutation">missense mutation</a> in the DNA repair gene <a href="O-6-methylguanine-DNA%20methyltransferase">MGMT</a>, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration). Five different studies found that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene <a href="PMS2">PMS2</a> expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner <a href="MLH1">MLH1</a> was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the <a href="microRNA">microRNA</a>, <a href="miR-155">miR-155</a>, which down-regulates MLH1.

In further examples (tabulated in Table 4 of this reference), epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13%–100% for the DNA repair genes <a href="BRCA1">BRCA1</a>, <a href="Werner%20syndrome%20ATP-dependent%20helicase">WRN</a>, <a href="FANCB">FANCB</a>, <a href="FANCF">FANCF</a>, <a href="O-6-methylguanine-DNA%20methyltransferase">MGMT</a>, <a href="MLH1">MLH1</a>, <a href="MSH2">MSH2</a>, <a href="MSH4">MSH4</a>, <a href="ERCC1">ERCC1</a>, <a href="ERCC4">XPF</a>, <a href="NEIL1">NEIL1</a> and <a href="Ataxia%20telangiectasia%20mutated">ATM</a>. These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian, colorectal and head and neck). Two or three deficiencies in the expression of ERCC1, XPF or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated by Facista et al.

The chart in this section shows some frequent DNA damaging agents, examples of DNA lesions they cause, and the pathways that deal with these DNA damages. At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes. Of these, 83 are directly employed in repairing the 5 types of DNA damages illustrated in the chart.

Some of the more well studied genes central to these repair processes are shown in the chart. The gene designations shown in red, gray or cyan indicate genes frequently epigenetically altered in various types of cancers. Wikipedia articles on each of the genes highlighted by red, gray or cyan describe the epigenetic alteration(s) and the cancer(s) in which these epimutations are found. Four review articles, and two broad experimental survey articles also document most of these epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies in cancers.

Red-highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers. When these genes have low or absent expression, DNA damages can accumulate. Replication errors past these damages (see <a href="DNA%20repair%23translesion%20synthesis">translesion synthesis</a>) can lead to increased mutations and, ultimately, cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in accurate DNA repair pathways appear to be central to <a href="carcinogenesis">carcinogenesis</a>.

The two gray-highlighted genes "<a href="RAD51">RAD51</a>" and "<a href="BRCA2">BRCA2</a>", are required for <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a>al repair. They are sometimes epigenetically over-expressed and sometimes under-expressed in certain cancers. As indicated in the Wikipedia articles on <a href="RAD51">RAD51</a> and <a href="BRCA2">BRCA2</a>, such cancers ordinarily have epigenetic deficiencies in other DNA repair genes. These repair deficiencies would likely cause increased unrepaired DNA damages. The over-expression of "RAD51" and "BRCA2" seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory "RAD51" or "BRCA2" over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages. In those cases where "RAD51" or "BRCA2" are under-expressed, this would itself lead to increased unrepaired DNA damages. Replication errors past these damages (see <a href="DNA%20repair%23translesion%20synthesis">translesion synthesis</a>) could cause increased mutations and cancer, so that under-expression of "RAD51" or "BRCA2" would be carcinogenic in itself.

Cyan-highlighted genes are in the <a href="microhomology-mediated%20end%20joining">microhomology-mediated end joining</a> (MMEJ) pathway and are up-regulated in cancer. MMEJ is an additional error-prone "inaccurate" repair pathway for double-strand breaks. In MMEJ repair of a double-strand break, an homology of 5–25 complementary base pairs between both paired strands is sufficient to align the strands, but mismatched ends (flaps) are usually present. MMEJ removes the extra nucleotides (flaps) where strands are joined, and then ligates the strands to create an intact DNA double helix. MMEJ almost always involves at least a small deletion, so that it is a mutagenic pathway. <a href="Flap%20structure-specific%20endonuclease%201">FEN1</a>, the flap endonuclease in MMEJ, is epigenetically increased by promoter hypomethylation and is over-expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung. PARP1 is also over-expressed when its promoter region <a href="ETS1">ETS</a> site is <a href="Cancer%20epigenetics">epigenetically</a> hypomethylated, and this contributes to progression to endometrial cancer, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, and BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer. Other genes in the <a href="Microhomology-mediated%20end%20joining">MMEJ</a> pathway are also over-expressed in a number of cancers (see <a href="Microhomology-mediated%20end%20joining">MMEJ</a> for summary), and are also shown in cyan.

Differential activity of DNA repair pathways across various regions of the human genome causes mutations to be very unevenly distributed within tumor genomes. In particular, the gene-rich, early-replicating regions of the human genome exhibit lower mutation frequencies than the gene-poor, late-replicating <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a>. One mechanism underlying this involves the <a href="histone%20modification">histone modification</a> <a href="H3K36me3">H3K36me3</a>, which can recruit <a href="DNA%20mismatch%20repair">mismatch repair</a> proteins, thereby lowering mutation rates in <a href="H3K36me3">H3K36me3</a>-marked regions. Another important mechanism concerns <a href="nucleotide%20excision%20repair">nucleotide excision repair</a>, which can be recruited by the transcription machinery, lowering somatic mutation rates in active genes and other open chromatin regions.

The basic processes of DNA repair are highly <a href="conservation%20%28genetics%29">conserved</a> among both <a href="prokaryotes">prokaryotes</a> and <a href="eukaryotes">eukaryotes</a> and even among <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a>s (<a href="virus">virus</a>es which infect <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>); however, more complex organisms with more complex genomes have correspondingly more complex repair mechanisms. The ability of a large number of protein <a href="structural%20motif">structural motif</a>s to catalyze relevant chemical reactions has played a significant role in the elaboration of repair mechanisms during evolution. For an extremely detailed review of hypotheses relating to the evolution of DNA repair, see.

The <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> indicates that single-cell life began to proliferate on the planet at some point during the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> period, although exactly when recognizably modern life first emerged is unclear. <a href="Nucleic%20acid">Nucleic acid</a>s became the sole and universal means of encoding genetic information, requiring DNA repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor. The emergence of Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere (known as the "<a href="oxygen%20catastrophe">oxygen catastrophe</a>") due to <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> organisms, as well as the presence of potentially damaging <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a>s in the cell due to <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>, necessitated the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms that act specifically to counter the types of damage induced by <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a>.

On some occasions, DNA damage is not repaired, or is repaired by an error-prone mechanism that results in a change from the original sequence. When this occurs, <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s may propagate into the genomes of the cell's progeny. Should such an event occur in a <a href="germ%20line">germ line</a> cell that will eventually produce a <a href="gamete">gamete</a>, the mutation has the potential to be passed on to the organism's offspring. The rate of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> in a particular species (or, in a particular gene) is a function of the rate of mutation. As a consequence, the rate and accuracy of DNA repair mechanisms have an influence over the process of evolutionary change. DNA damage protection and repair does not influence the rate of adaptation by gene regulation and by recombination and selection of alleles. On the other hand, DNA damage repair and protection does influence the rate of accumulation of irreparable, advantageous, code expanding, inheritable mutations, and slows down the evolutionary mechanism for expansion of the genome of organisms with new functionalities. The tension between evolvability and mutation repair and protection needs further investigation.

A technology named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (shortened to <a href="CRISPR">CRISPR</a>-Cas9) was discovered in 2012. The new technology allows anyone with molecular biology training to alter the genes of any species with precision.<br>
It is cheaper, more efficient, and more precise than other technologies. With the help of CRISPR–Cas9, parts of a genome can be edited by scientists by removing, adding, or altering parts in a DNA sequence.

Wail al-Shehri

Wail Mohammed al-Shehri (, ; also <a href="transliteration">transliterated</a> as Alshehri) (July 31, 1973 – September 11, 2001) was one of five <a href="aircraft%20hijacking">hijacker</a>s of <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, which was hijacked and flown into the North Tower of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> as part of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

Shehri was an elementary school teacher from <a href="Khamis%20Mushait">Khamis Mushait</a> in the <a href="%27Asir">Asir</a> region of <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. In early 2000, he traveled to <a href="Medina">Medina</a> to seek treatment for mental problems. He and his younger brother <a href="Waleed%20al-Shehri">Waleed</a> traveled to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in March 2000 and joined an <a href="Afghan%20training%20camp">Al-Qaeda training camp</a>. The brothers were chosen, along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his <a href="will%20%28law%29">last will and testament</a> on video.

Shehri arrived in the United States in early June 2001, staying in <a href="budget%20motel">budget motel</a>s in the <a href="Boynton%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Boynton Beach</a> area of south <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. On September 5, 2001, Shehri traveled to <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and checked into a motel with his brother. Six days later, Shehri arrived early in the morning at Boston's <a href="Logan%20International%20Airport">Logan International Airport</a> and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. Fifteen minutes after take off, Shehri along with his brother Waleed and 3 others hijacked and deliberately crashed the airliner into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m.

In the aftermath of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since.

Wail al-Shehri and his younger brother Waleed were from <a href="Khamis%20Mushait">Khamis Mushait</a> in the <a href="%27Asir">Asir</a> province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, along the <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>i border. Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar neighborhood in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. The family strictly adhered to the <a href="Wahhabism">Wahabi</a> school of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and could speak English; however, Wail knew little English.

During high school and college, Shehri was deeply religious and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young people in the region idolized <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, <a href="Mohammed%20bin%20Awad%20bin%20Laden">Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden</a>. <a href="Ahmed%20al-Nami">Ahmed al-Nami</a> and <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, who were both hijackers on <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a>, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.

After graduating from <a href="Abha">Abha</a> teachers college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri took a job as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.

Wail and Waleed al-Shehri disappeared after going to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague about when they would return. Both had expressed interest in joining the <a href="jihad">jihad</a> in <a href="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, though may have been diverted to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself "Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi" after one of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s companions.

In March 2000, he left for <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> with Waleed and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Nami">Ahmed al-Nami</a>; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the <a href="Khalden%20training%20camp">Khalden training camp</a> and then <a href="Al%20Farouq%20training%20camp">Al Farouq training camp</a> near <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>. Details on how the non-pilot ("<a href="Hijackers%20in%20the%20September%2011%20attacks%23Muscle%20hijackers">muscle</a>") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) director <a href="George%20Tenet">George Tenet</a> later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.

Once Wail and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received $2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on October 3, 2000, and then obtained <a href="United%20States%20visas">United States visas</a> on October 24. On his visa application, Wail al-Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer/school as "South City", and his destination as "Wasantwn". Wail indicated his occupation as "teacher", and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with Wail's teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States.

In late 2000, Wail traveled to the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by <a href="Mustafa%20al-Hawsawi">Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi</a>. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including <a href="Majed%20Moqed">Majed Moqed</a>, <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Nami">Ahmed al-Nami</a>. The <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a> believes that three of the future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and then onward to <a href="Iran">Iran</a> where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior <a href="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.

Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Ghamdi">Ahmed al-Ghamdi</a> on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on <a href="Al%20Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> in September 2002. Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of <a href="Abdulaziz%20al-Omari">Abdulaziz al-Omari</a> reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.

On June 5, 2001, Wail obtained an International Driving Permit, which was issued in <a href="Sharjah%20%28city%29">Sharjah</a> in the United Arab Emirates. Wail al-Shehri arrived together with fellow al-Qaeda member <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> at <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a>, via <a href="London">London</a>, from <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> on June 8. Both were admitted as tourists for six months. Shehri opened a bank account at SunTrust Bank in Florida on June 18, with a deposit of $8,000 that came from <a href="American%20Express">American Express</a> traveler's cheques purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates.

Shehri moved into the Homing Inn, a budget motel in <a href="Boynton%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Boynton Beach</a>, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and <a href="Satam%20al-Suqami">Satam al-Suqami</a>. Wail and Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they received Florida state non-driver identifications on July 3. Shehri checked into the Panther Motel & Apartments, in <a href="Deerfield%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Deerfield Beach</a>, with his brother and Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, Wail was a member of the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and Suqami. During the summer of 2001, Wail regularly used computers at the Delray Beach Public Library.

On August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made reservations on <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, using the <a href="Mail%20Boxes%20Etc.">Mail Boxes Etc.</a> in Hollywood, Florida as their address. The Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.

Wail checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in <a href="Chestnut%20Hill%2C%20Massachusetts">Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts</a> on September 5, 2001, staying in room 432. While staying at the Park Inn, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri may have called a prostitute. Wail al-Shehri accompanied his brother on September 9 to the Travelex at Logan International Airport, where Waleed attempted to wire $5,000 to the United Arab Emirates. Waleed had insufficient documentation, so Wail and Waleed returned the next day to complete the transaction. <a href="Mustafa%20Muhammad%20Ahmad">Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad</a> received the funds on September 11 at Al-Ansari Exchange in Sharjah. Hijacker <a href="Abdulaziz%20al-Omari">Abdulaziz al-Omari</a> possibly spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a> for <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a> on September 10. When Wail and Waleed al-Shehri checked out on September 11, they left a sheet of instructions for flying a jet behind in their hotel room.

Wail al-Shehri, his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on the morning of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the <a href="Computer%20Assisted%20Passenger%20Prescreening%20System">Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System</a> (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.

By 07:40, all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight 11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower <a href="collapse%20of%20the%20World%20Trade%20Center">collapsed</a> at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.

Waleed al-Shehri was reported to have been found alive by a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Reports said that the Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat's son was trained as a pilot at <a href="Embry-Riddle%20Aeronautical%20University">Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</a> in <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a>, and was working as a pilot for <a href="Saudi%20Arabian%20Airlines">Saudi Arabian Airlines</a>. At the time of the attacks, he was in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> for a training program. There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat's son was the victim of mistaken identity.

<a href="Jamal%20Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, of <a href="Al-Watan%20%28Saudi%20Arabia%29">Al-Watan</a> and <a href="ArabNews">ArabNews</a> in Saudi Arabia, spoke with Muhammad Ali al-Shehri in Khamis Mushait, who said his sons Wail and Waleed had been missing for months. Wail al-Shehri's father denied reports that Wail had an aeronautics degree, as some news reports said, "My son Wail was 25 years old and had a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher’s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah." His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that Wail and Waleed were involved in the September 11 attacks, "If that turns out to be the truth, then I'll never, never accept it from them. I'll never forgive them for that." Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled "A Saudi Apology" for <a href="Dateline%20NBC">Dateline NBC</a> aired on August 25, 2002, <a href="John%20Hockenberry">John Hockenberry</a> traveled to Asir, where he interviewed Shehri's brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed.

Saudi officials later stated that the names of the hijackers were in fact correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to <a href="9/11%20conspiracy%20theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.

Ohio Wesleyan University

Ohio Wesleyan University (OWU) is a <a href="private%20university">private</a> <a href="Liberal%20arts%20colleges%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal arts university</a> in <a href="Delaware%2C%20Ohio">Delaware, Ohio</a>. It was founded in 1842 by <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> leaders and <a href="Ohio%20Valley">Central Ohio</a> residents as a <a href="nonsectarian">nonsectarian</a> institution, and is a member of the <a href="Five%20Colleges%20of%20Ohio">Ohio Five</a> – a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges. Ohio Wesleyan has always admitted students irrespective of religion or race and maintained that the university "is forever to be conducted on the most <a href="Classical%20liberalism">liberal</a> principles."

The site is 27 miles (44 km) north of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>. It includes the main <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings">academic and residential campus</a>, the <a href="Perkins%20Observatory">Perkins Observatory</a>, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve.

In 2010, Ohio Wesleyan had the eleventh highest percentage of <a href="international%20student">international student</a>s among liberal arts colleges for the seventeenth straight year. In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, "<a href="Niche%20%28company%29">Niche</a>" ranked Ohio Wesleyan the 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college in the U.S. "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" ranked Ohio Wesleyan 95th among U.S. liberal arts colleges in its 2018 edition.

In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the highest order" in central Ohio. To that end, they purchased the <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings%23Elliott%20Hall">Mansion House Hotel</a>, a former health resort with its Sulphur Spring, using funds raised from local residents. Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing "the <a href="democracy">democratic</a> spirit of teaching", which was approved by the <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> State <a href="Legislature">Legislature</a>. Early in the following year they opened the <a href="college%20preparatory">college preparatory</a> Academy and formed a <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees">Board of Trustees</a>. Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, founder of <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>, opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but <a href="nonsectarian">nonsectarian</a> institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.

Ohio Wesleyan's first president, <a href="Edward%20Thomson">Edward Thomson</a>, stated in his <a href="Inauguration">inaugural address</a> on August 5, 1846 that the school was "a product of the <a href="classical%20liberalism">liberality</a> of the local people." This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan's vocal opposition to <a href="slavery">slavery</a> in the 1850s. In the annual celebration for <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick endorsed Ohio Wesleyan's "ideals of democracy" during his oration.

During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment. <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings%23Sturges%20Hall">Sturges Hall</a> was constructed as the University's first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in <a href="History%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%23Campus%20expansion">Merrick Hall</a>. The <a href="Ohio%20Wesleyan%20Female%20College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a>, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and <a href="music%20education">music education</a> greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.
By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844). To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings%23University%20Hall">University Hall</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings%23Slocum%20Hall">Slocum Library</a>, extensions to the <a href="Ohio%20Wesleyan%20Female%20College">Monnett campus</a>, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.

Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="Public%20speaking">speech</a>, <a href="history">history</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="English%20studies">English</a>, and <a href="economics">economics</a>. This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe. Two professional schools for <a href="law">law</a> and <a href="medicine">medicine</a> were formed in 1896.

In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name. The <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree was abolished, which left only the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a>. Two students were selected as <a href="Rhodes%20Scholars">Rhodes Scholars</a> in 1905 and 1909. <a href="Edwards%20Gymnasium">Edwards Gymnasium</a> was built in 1906. In 1907, the United Societies of <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the "Eta of Ohio" ΦΒΚ chapter on campus. In 1909, the school added <a href="History%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%23Campus%20expansion">Sanborn Hall</a>, housing the Music Department.

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized. During the presidency of <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20presidents">John W. Hoffman</a> (1916–1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a <a href="University-preparatory%20school">preparatory school</a>, and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment. Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and <a href="sororities">sororities</a> were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and <a href="Perkins%20Observatory">Perkins Observatory</a>; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.

During <a href="the%20Great%20Depression">the Great Depression</a>, both enrollment and <a href="alumni">alumni</a> donations shrank. While the <a href="Faculty%20%28teaching%20staff%29">faculty</a> size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20presidents">Edmund D. Soper</a> (1928–1938), Acting President <a href="Edward%20Loranus%20Rice">Edward Loranus Rice</a> (1938–1939), and <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20presidents">Herbert John Burgstahler</a> (1939–1949).

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems. Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from <a href="New%20England">New England</a> states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>. In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in its personnel, its resources, and its students", Ohio Wesleyan lost its "symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement. Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954. In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control. They eventually settled on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.

Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the <a href="ROTC">ROTC</a> building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970. Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period. Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing "<a href="party%20school">party school</a>" image, leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body. Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper "<a href="The%20Transcript">The Transcript</a>" frequently criticized Wenzlau's presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college". This exchange resulted in a "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.

The president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts. Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="National%20Broadcasting%20Company">NBC</a> networks.

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation. The <a href="Ohio%20Wesleyan%20Battling%20Bishops">Battling Bishops</a> won <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> <a href="Division%20III%20%28NCAA%29">Division III</a> national championships in men's <a href="College%20basketball">basketball</a> (1988) and men's (1998, 2011) and women's (2001, 2002) <a href="College%20soccer">soccer</a>. Despite these efforts, Ohio Wesleyan is one of many <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> colleges in the United States that is experiencing declining enrollment. The 2017 incoming class was 9% smaller than the year before.

Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton-Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship. The <a href="Schimmel-Conrades%20Science%20Center">Schimmel/Conrades Science Center</a> opened in 2004 to provide of additional space for the science departments. As of 2010, the university is engaged in a fundraising campaign to improve athletics facilities by adding a new turf facility, a new field house and a pool, and a gateway connecting all sports facilities on campus. In 2018, the University opened the Delaware Entrepreneurial Center at OWU in collaboration with the City of Delaware and Delaware County.

Ohio Wesleyan University is accredited by <a href="The%20Higher%20Learning%20Commission">The Higher Learning Commission</a>, and is a member of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Colleges%20Association">Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>, the <a href="Oberlin%20Group">Oberlin Group</a>, and the <a href="Five%20Colleges%20of%20Ohio">Five Colleges of Ohio</a>, a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges which also includes <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a>, <a href="Oberlin%20College">Oberlin College</a>, <a href="The%20College%20of%20Wooster">The College of Wooster</a>, and <a href="Denison%20University">Denison University</a>.
For 2011, Ohio Wesleyan accepted approximately 52% of its <a href="rolling%20admission">regular decision</a> applicants, 33% of its transfer applicants, and had a <a href="Yield%20%28college%20admissions%29">yield rate</a> of 26%. In 2010, the college accepted 36% of its international applicants. The middle 50% range of matriculating students for the class of 2010 was 1125–1320 for the <a href="SAT">SAT</a> (old scale) and 24–30 for the <a href="ACT%20%28examination%29">ACT</a>. Approximately 35% of accepted applicants were granted internal <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a>s. Ohio Wesleyan follows a <a href="need-blind%20admission">need-blind admission</a> policy; financial circumstances are not considered when deciding whether to admit applicants. As of 2010, OWU's 1,950 students come from 43 states and 57 countries; 47% are from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, 11% are international, and 54% are female. The student body is about 10% <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a>, 6% <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>, and 9% <a href="African%20Americans">Black</a>. Fifty-nine percent of Ohio Wesleyan students claim no religious affiliation. The student-faculty ratio is 11:1 and faculty members teach all classes. Excluding independent studies and <a href="senior%20thesis">senior theses</a>, nearly 60% of Ohio Wesleyan's class sections have fewer than twenty students enrolled. Ohio Wesleyan is generally known for a strong <a href="Social%20liberalism">"left-leaning"</a> student body and an administration with a "permissive" attitude. In 2007, 60% of OWU students favored the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, "<a href="Niche%20%28company%29">Niche (company)</a>" ranked Ohio Wesleyan 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college in the U.S.

Ohio Wesleyan admits students of all cultures, lifestyles, and socio-economic backgrounds. An index examining gay-friendly policies places OWU among the nation's <a href="gay%20rights">gay-friendly</a> colleges, and the university enacts policies to meet the six criteria developed by the Campus-Pride organization for recruiting and supporting students from a <a href="LGBT">lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender</a> population. Nearly 18% of students at Ohio Wesleyan receive <a href="United%20States%20federal%20law">Federal</a> <a href="Pell%20Grants">Pell Grants</a>, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. This measure indicates the degree to which economically disadvantaged groups are represented at OWU.

The <a href="faculty%20%28teaching%20staff%29">faculty</a> consists of 142 <a href="tenure">tenure</a>d members. As of 2010, all the university's tenured or tenure-track faculty members hold a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD</a> or other <a href="terminal%20degree">terminal degree</a>. The faculty is 37% female and 63% male, with 10% from underrepresented groups. Also as of 2010, women constitute 37% of the tenured professors and earn 94% of what male professors earn – numbers which suggest favorable gender circumstances.

Freshmen are paired early in their first year with academic advisors who oversee their students' academic progress. Upon completing 34 units of coursework, students may earn diplomas in Bachelor of Science, <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a>, or <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Music">Bachelor of Music</a>. Ohio Wesleyan has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines; as of 2005, OWU offered 39 majors.

In its early days, OWU's curriculum began with classical studies, for the course catalogue maintained that "the classical course in Greek and Latin and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit." Scientific courses were added to Ohio Wesleyan's curriculum in 1849, and since then, <a href="science">scientific</a> subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum. OWU also has a highly respected <a href="music">music</a> department.

Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalism</a> since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded <a href="Kwassui%20College">Kwassui Women's College</a> in <a href="Nagasaki%2C%20Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant. Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan. In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and opened a school in <a href="Mutare">Mutare</a>, <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, that eventually became the <a href="University%20of%20Africa">Africa University</a>. In March 1988, Conrad Kent established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Ohio Wesleyan students.
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students. The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s. In a study adjusted for school size, Ohio Wesleyan came ninth among 118 American colleges and universities in total aid awards to international students and 69th in average award per international student among both large universities and small liberal arts colleges. <a href="South%20East%20Asia">South East Asia</a>n students have significantly contributed to this growth. The <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> flag, along with the flags of more than sixty represented <a href="nations">nations</a> and the U.S. flag, flies in University Hall in honor of the ideal of peaceful international relations.

High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target of the school's international focus. Under a <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Colleges%20Association">Great Lakes Colleges Association</a> agreement, OWU established an exchange program with <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and 30 Japanese students to study at Ohio Wesleyan each year. The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988, conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the <a href="University%20of%20Salamanca">University of Salamanca</a> in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. The academic collaboration frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the <a href="Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a> in Salamanca.

The Beeghly Library is the main library of OWU. The library contains nearly 500,000 volumes in its collection, and is also home to the Archives of Ohio United Methodism, the Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Artifacts collection, as well as an archival collection of materials related to the history of the university. 

The Hobson Science Library is part of the Schimmel Conrades Science Center and supports research in the earth, life, and physical sciences.

The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, <a href="http%3A//nyartsprogram.org/">The New York Arts Program</a> for the performing, visual and media arts (a GLCA arts program), <a href="Perkins%20Observatory">Perkins Observatory</a>, <a href="Strand%20Theatre%20%28Delaware%2C%20Ohio%29">The Strand Theatre</a>, and the <a href="Kraus%20Preserve%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University">Kraus Wilderness Preserve</a>.

Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus. The observatory is named after <a href="Hiram%20Perkins">Hiram Perkins</a>, a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college. When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest <a href="telescope">telescope</a> in the world, which has since been moved to <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. The Perkins dome now houses a telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio.

The university also maintains offices for <a href="study%20abroad">study abroad</a>, US domestic study, and <a href="internship">internship</a> programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in research and <a href="internship">internship</a> positions. The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently. and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware. Students participate in Delaware's community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an <a href="experiential%20learning">experiential learning</a> partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools. More than 150 Ohio Wesleyan students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from Columbus.

The Ohio Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community, and exposes international students to <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20States">American culture</a> through the community. The program's ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in events for local <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a> community organizations.

Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of <a href="civic%20engagement">civic engagement</a> and <a href="activism">activism</a>. Progress OWU allows students from Ohio Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on <a href="politics">politics</a>, <a href="public%20policy">public policy</a>, and <a href="corporate">corporate</a> and <a href="social%20issues">social issues</a>, both on campus and in the local community.

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts. In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic <a href="Strand%20Theatre%20%28Delaware%2C%20Ohio%29">Strand Theatre</a> in downtown Delaware.

The university and the City of Delaware sponsor several events in town throughout the year: the Delaware Arts Festival, the <a href="Little%20Brown%20Jug%20%28horse%20racing%29">Little Brown Jug</a>, the Delaware County Fair, and the Castle Arts Affair. The Delaware Arts Festival is an annual event held the weekend after <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a> on the streets of Historic Downtown Delaware. The festival hosts over 170 booths featuring works of local, regional, and other artists. OWU professors chair the committees that select winners. The Little Brown Jug, a <a href="harness%20racing">harness race</a>, is run during the Delaware County Fair in September. The OWU president and the college mascot traditionally award the trophy for the first division of the first heat of the race.

Ohio Wesleyan University has 95 student clubs and organizations. The university offers three <a href="chapels">chapels</a> as well as several <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> and other religious groups for its students. Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including <a href="chess">chess</a>, <a href="ultimate%20%28sport%29">ultimate</a>, <a href="finance">finance</a>, and medieval sword fighting. There are two "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" singing groups on campus, "The OWtsiders," a student-run group formed in 1999, and the all-female "Pitch Black" established in 2005. Another entertainment-related club is "The Babbling Bishops", an <a href="improvisational%20comedy">improvisational comedy</a> troupe. The "Babbling Bishops" started in the fall of 1990 when a group of theatre concentration students formed a performance-oriented project for their theatre degrees. The project became an <a href="improvisational%20comedy">improv</a> comedy troupe, rehearsing in <a href="List%20of%20Ohio%20Wesleyan%20University%20buildings">Stuyvesant Hall</a> and performing with other college improv <a href="wikt%3Atroupe">troupes</a> since 1996.

Socially conscious students can join organizations such as the <a href="activism">activist</a> group "Young Democratic Socialists" or participate in <a href="student%20government">student government</a> groups, such as the Campus Programming Board and the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs. The "PRIDE" organization offers support to OWU's <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> students.

Fewer than a third of Ohio Wesleyan's students are involved in <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities">Greek life</a>, but that percentage has fluctuated significantly throughout the university's history. All six fraternities and five sororities on campus are currently involved in many <a href="philanthropy">philanthropic</a> and community programs.

Ohio Wesleyan has four religious chaplains: A <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> minister, a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest, and a <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> rabbi. In addition to student groups and services associated with these three religions, there are groups associated with <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarian Universalism</a>, and even a group which holds services that are simply "spiritual" and separate from any organized religion. Services are also available for <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>s, <a href="Christian%20Scientist">Christian Scientist</a>s, <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s, and <a href="Baha%27i">Baha'i</a>s, and there are many local religious groups in Delaware, Ohio.

OWU's oldest student organizations are its literary clubs, including a number of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The school's student-run weekly newspaper, "<a href="The%20Transcript">The Transcript</a>", is the oldest continuously published, independent, college newspaper in the United States. "The OWL", an annual literary publication, features students' work and is one of the nation's oldest college <a href="literary%20magazine">literary magazine</a>s. Other student publications include "The Civic Arts Review", the electronic "Connect2OWU" bulletin, and "@Wesleyan", a quarterly online magazine. OWU Radio, formerly WSLN, broadcasts from Phillips Hall, and offers show times to students, faculty, and local citizens of Delaware.

The university also has a student government, the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs (WCSA).

<a href="Student%20activism">Activism</a> as represented in OWU's founding vision has had a significant role in Ohio Wesleyan's history.

The first president, <a href="Edward%20Thomson">Edward Thomson</a>, staunchly supported the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolition of slavery</a> and <a href="classical%20liberalism">liberalism</a>. Other individuals associated with the university have fought racism. <a href="Branch%20Rickey">Branch Rickey</a>, an alumnus, broke the <a href="racial%20segregation">racial barrier</a> in baseball. Mary King, a civil rights activist, worked alongside <a href="Dr.%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> in the U.S. <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> while she was a staff member of OWU's <a href="Student%20Nonviolent%20Coordinating%20Committee">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC). In the 1980s, Ohio Wesleyan's administration, moved by student activism, pledged and eventually fully divested holdings connected to South Africa. As of September 2007, Ohio Wesleyan joined a small group of liberal colleges that actively opposed the methodology and usefulness of "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" college rankings, despite the fact that the magazine ranked Ohio Wesleyan among the top national liberal arts colleges. Ohio Wesleyan's concern intensified with disclosures about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides.

OWU has partisan political groups ranging from liberal to conservative, such the College Republicans and the College Democrats, and several activism awareness groups such as Black Men of the Future, Black Student Union (formerly Student Union on Black Awareness), PRIDE, Viva Latinx, and Rafiki Wa Afrika. Due to the school's proximity to Columbus, the Ohio state capital, many politically inclined students serve internships for state representatives. In the 2000s, students have been active on the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, <a href="race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">race</a>, <a href="globalization">globalization</a>, and women's <a href="reproductive%20rights">reproductive rights</a>.

Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a "People's Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival. It started as a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the <a href="Ohio%20Wesleyan%20Female%20College">Monnett Campus</a>, where female students danced around the <a href="Maypole">Maypole</a>, while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.

In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first "Mock Convention", which has recurred in every <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election">United States presidential election</a> year since 1920. Its purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents about the <a href="presidential%20nominating%20convention">presidential nominating convention</a>, presidential candidate, and key issues in the upcoming election.

Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear "dinks", red caps with black brims and a black W on the front. Disobedient students who refused to wear the "dink" were tossed into the "Sulphur Spring" (see later reference). This tradition ended in the 1960s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester.

Ohio Wesleyan's <a href="Homecoming">Homecoming</a> takes place in early October, while the Ohio Wesleyan <a href="American%20football">football</a> team plays one of its traditional rivals. New events, such as a bonfire and a five kilometer run, have been added from as recently as 2004.

The "President's Ball", a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first Saturday of December. Other traditions include "OWU vs. Denison", which stages a "fierce" athletic rivalry between Ohio Wesleyan and <a href="Denison%20University">Denison University</a>; the " Sagan Colloquium", spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an issue of concern to the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a>; and "Orchesis", an annual celebration of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year. "Fresh-X" is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates.

The campus used to host two major musical events, "Unity through Music" and "Springfest". "Unity through Music" occurred once a year in the fall semester, and covered various musical styles in a <a href="carnival">carnival</a> atmosphere, during the day; while, during the evening, a huge dance is held in the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center. Springfest, the second musical event, proceeded in mid-April and had featured well-known music groups such as <a href="Counting%20Crows">Counting Crows</a>, <a href="The%20Roots">The Roots</a>, <a href="Guster">Guster</a>, <a href="Ben%20Folds">Ben Folds</a>, and <a href="Gym%20Class%20Heroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>. It was organized by the Campus Programming Board, who have changed the name to "Bishop Bash," in an attempt to create more campus pride. Bishop Bash has hosted multiple different styled events, including <a href="Drake%20Bell">Drake Bell</a>, <a href="Bo%20Burnham">Bo Burnham</a>, and most recently, in 2017, <a href="The%20Mowgli%27s">The Mowgli's</a> and <a href="NeverShoutNever">NeverShoutNever</a>.

A rock next to Hayes Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and students continually repaint it with <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> and <a href="slogans">slogans</a>.

The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus. First-year students are required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing.

Thomson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus. Welch Hall is designated as a "quiet" dorm for honors students. Hayes Hall is an all-female dorm.

Approximately 90 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are <a href="cooperative">co-ops</a> united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 10–17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2017–2018 academic year, the SLUs consist of The <a href="Peace">Peace</a> and <a href="Justice">Justice</a> House, The Citizens of the World House, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The House of Linguistic Diversity, The House of Spiritual Athletes, The <a href="Ecology">Tree</a> House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own members and do not have <a href="resident%20assistant">Resident Advisers</a> or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a Resident Advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis. In addition the school offers Theme Houses, which do not have to go through the renewal process. They include the Honors House (HoHo) and House of Black Culture.

Off-campus housing is available only to students residing in Delaware, OH while living with their spouse or direct family; 17% of students live off-campus. Most students assert Ohio Wesleyan's policy of off-campus housing as one of the "worst things" about Ohio Wesleyan because of the resulting shortage of the number of lottery tickets allowing people to live off due to the off-campus lottery cap.

Ohio Wesleyan participates in the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA's</a> <a href="Division%20III%20%28NCAA%29">Division III</a> as a member of the <a href="North%20Coast%20Athletic%20Conference">North Coast Athletic Conference</a> (NCAC). Known as the "Battling Bishops", Ohio Wesleyan competes in 25 varsity men's and women's sports. The newest sports, men's wrestling and women's rowing, begin competition during the 2018-2019 academic year. The official school colors are red and black.
Formal athletics at the college date to 1875, when the first football teams were organized to play against other institutions. In the late 1880s, Ohio Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of Ohio behind the pitching of <a href="Phil%20Saylor">Phil "Lefty" Saylor</a>. The school joined the <a href="Ohio%20Athletic%20Conference">Ohio Athletic Conference</a> along with <a href="Oberlin%20College">Oberlin College</a>, <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a>, <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State</a>, and <a href="Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University">Case Western</a> in 1902. In 1983, Ohio Wesleyan joined with nine other colleges in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania to create the North Coast Athletic Conference. The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the athletic one.

The men's <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a>, <a href="golf">golf</a> and <a href="soccer">soccer</a> teams are the most historically successful of the varsity teams, and soccer is the university's most intently followed sport. For seven of the last twelve years, Ohio Wesleyan has won the NCAC conference All-Sports Trophy for excellence in both women's and men's sports. In the <a href="NACDA%20Director%27s%20Cup">Sears Director's Cup</a> standings, OWU is among the top 25 overall collegiate athletics programs in the country. Because of the North Coast Athletic Association athletic agreement, the university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic recruiting.

Ohio Wesleyan has won five NCAA Division III Championships, including men's basketball (<a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20III%20Basketball%20Championship">1988</a>), men's soccer (<a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Soccer%20Championship">1998 and 2011</a>), and women's soccer (<a href="NCAA%20Women%27s%20Soccer%20Championship">2001</a> and <a href="NCAA%20Women%27s%20Soccer%20Championship">2002</a>). In addition, Ohio Wesleyan's varsity athletic teams have been NCAC champions over 100 times, leading the teams of <a href="Denison%20University">Denison University</a> and <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a>.

The nickname "The Battling Bishops" dates to 1925. This is also the name of the university's mascot, "The Battling Bishop". Due to its ironic name, the mascot has been listed as one of the weirdest college mascots. Due to its red robe, "The Battling Bishop" looks actually like a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a>. Before 1925, Ohio Wesleyan's teams were referred to as "The Red and Black" and "The Methodists". Many schools, including several other Methodist ones, also claimed crimson and black as their colors, so the university decided to change the name. 
Ohio Wesleyan maintains athletic <a href="sports%20rivalry">rivalries</a> with other NCAC institutions. The men's lacrosse team has a historic rivalry with <a href="Denison%20University">Denison University</a>, the football team with <a href="Wittenberg%20University">Wittenberg University</a>, the soccer team with <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a>, and the <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> team with <a href="Oberlin%20College">Oberlin College</a>. Both Denison and Ohio Wesleyan issued alerts to their fans specifically for the OWU-Denison lacrosse game about unsportsmanlike behavior and profanity.

In addition to the school's varsity athletics, club sports teams, including <a href="ultimate%20frisbee">ultimate frisbee</a>, <a href="chess">chess</a>, <a href="hockey">hockey</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="rugby%20football">rugby</a>, <a href="ski">ski</a>, and <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba</a>, have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Office of Student Activities. Ohio Wesleyan's intramural program includes 16 sports. Sports such as <a href="skiing">skiing</a>, <a href="squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> and <a href="Water%20polo%23Game%20variations">water polo</a> have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.

"Oh we're from dear old Wesleyan" is Ohio Wesleyan University's primary <a href="fight%20song">fight song</a>. The song's lyrics were written in 1914 by Chass Cupett '1916.

Under the charter granted by the State of Ohio, the Board of Trustees possesses the legal authority to operate the college. The charter and bylaws stipulate a board of 34 trustees, of whom one is the president. In general, it is the board that elects the president. Since Ohio Wesleyan's beginnings, sixteen people have held the title of <a href="president">president</a>, and a few have served as interim president. Former presidents include lawyers, literary scholars, politicians, executives, and clergymen.

After several disagreements between Huddleston and the Ohio Wesleyan administration, Huddleston accepted a position as president of the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Hampshire">University of New Hampshire</a> and left Ohio Wesleyan on June 30, 2007, giving him the second shortest presidency, behind David Lockmiller, 1959–1961. On May 29, 2007, the appointment of current university provost Dr. David O. Robbins as interim president was unanimously endorsed by OWU's Board of Trustees. Dr. Robbins' term as Interim President began on July 1, 2007.

On December 17, 2007, Dr. Rockwell "Rock" Jones was elected to serve as the 16th president of Ohio Wesleyan University. Dr. Jones' inauguration ceremony took place on October 10, 2008 in Ohio Wesleyan's Gray Chapel, in University Hall.

Ohio Wesleyan alumni are active in several annual events, organizations, and initiatives. The events and associations with significant alumni involvement are Homecoming, 'W' Association, and A/PART (the alumni admission team). For the 2005–2006 fiscal year, Ohio Wesleyan's alumni giving rate was 35%. A number of the school's alumni have made notable contributions in the fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others.

Jørgen Jensen (soldier)

Jørgen Christian Jensen, (15 January 1891 – 31 May 1922) was a Danish-born <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that could be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a> at that time. Jensen emigrated to Australia in 1909, becoming a British subject at <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, South Australia, in 1914. A sailor and labourer before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) in March 1915, serving with the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a> during the latter stages of the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a>. After the Australian force withdrew to Egypt, Jensen was transferred to the newly formed <a href="50th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">50th Battalion</a>, and sailed for France with the unit in June 1916. On the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, he was wounded during the battalion's first serious action, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Battle of Mouquet Farm</a> in August, and only returned to his unit in late January 1917. On 2 April, his battalion attacked the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Outpost Line</a> at <a href="Noreuil">Noreuil</a>, where his actions leading to the capture of over fifty German soldiers resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross.

In June 1917, the 50th Battalion was involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>; the following month, Jensen, now a <a href="corporal">corporal</a>, was posted to a training unit in the United Kingdom. He returned to his battalion in October, and was promoted to temporary <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> in November. In March 1918, the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> was launched, and Jensen fought with his battalion at <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a> and <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a>. Shortly after the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Villers-Bretonneux">Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux</a>, Jensen was on patrol when he received a severe head wound, and was evacuated to the United Kingdom, then repatriated to Australia, where he was discharged in Adelaide at the end of the war. He worked as a marine store dealer and married in 1921, but died the following year.

Jørgen Christian Jensen was born on 15 January 1891 in <a href="L%C3%B8gst%C3%B8r">Løgstør</a>, Denmark, the son of Jørgen Christian Jensen and Christiane Sørensen, who was apparently also known as Jensen. Sørensen was a single mother who worked in agriculture. His early life was difficult, but he was a good student, and entered the fishing industry. In 1908, aged 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom before emigrating to Australia. He sailed to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in March 1909, then moved to <a href="Morgan%2C%20South%20Australia">Morgan, South Australia</a>, and later <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, working respectively as a sailor on <a href="Riverboat">river steamers</a> on the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>, and as a labourer. He was <a href="Naturalization">naturalised</a> as a British subject in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> on 7 September 1914.

On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) for service in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>; he was allotted to the 6th reinforcements to the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>. His reinforcement draft embarked on HMAT "Borda" at <a href="Outer%20Harbor%2C%20South%20Australia">Outer Harbor</a> on 23 June, and joined the battalion at <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, Turkey, on 4 August. By the time Jensen arrived, nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. For the remainder of the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a>, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line defending the beachhead until withdrawn to <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> in November. Jensen remained with his unit throughout, except for a week in September–October that he spent in hospital. The battalion embarked for Egypt in late November and spent the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. While in Egypt, the battalion was split into two, one half forming the nucleus of the new <a href="50th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">50th Battalion</a>, which was part of the <a href="13th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">13th Brigade</a>, <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">4th Division</a>. In April 1916, Jensen and several other 10th Battalion men were transferred to the 50th Battalion; later that month Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at <a href="tattoo%20%28bugle%20call%29">tattoo</a>. On 5 June the battalion embarked for France, arriving in <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> six days later. The unit then entrained for the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June near <a href="Fleurbaix">Fleurbaix</a>.

The 50th Battalion saw its first serious action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Battle of Mouquet Farm</a> in mid-August 1916. During the battle, the 50th Battalion suffered 414 casualties, largely from the heavy German artillery bombardment. On 14 August, Jensen had joined the casualty lists, hit in the left shoulder by a piece of <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">shrapnel</a>. He was evacuated to the UK and admitted to <a href="Graylingwell%20Hospital">Graylingwell War Hospital</a> in <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>. While in the UK, he was charged with more disciplinary infractions in September, December and January, on one occasion being sentenced to 28 days <a href="field%20punishment">field punishment</a> for missing the troop train to return to France, and on another serving 12 days detention for being <a href="Desertion">absent without leave</a>. He did not rejoin his unit until 28 January 1917.

The 50th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support and reserve positions, and underwent training in rear areas. The battalion was also involved in pursuing the Germans as they withdrew to the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> of fortifications. On 2 April, the 13th Brigade attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at <a href="Noreuil">Noreuil</a>. The attack consisted of the <a href="51st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">51st Battalion</a> attacking the village from the north, and the 50th Battalion from the south. During this assault, which was preceded by a weak artillery barrage, the 50th Battalion suffered extraordinary difficulties, and the centre company, to which Jensen belonged, was forced to detach a party of men equipped with a large number of <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s (then known as bombs) to deal with a strongly barricaded German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right. Jensen was a member of this party. His actions during the reduction of this post resulted in a recommendation for the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that could be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a> at that time. He was assisted in his actions by Private William Quinlan O'Connor and four others. The recommendation read: 

During the assault on Noreuil, Jensen also freed Australian prisoners, and assisted in the "mopping-up" of German resistance in the village itself when he captured a German officer or <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>, who pointed out which building the fire was coming from. The 50th Battalion suffered 360 casualties, including 95 dead, and captured 70 Germans, nearly all of whom were taken by Jensen and his party. O'Connor was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a> for his part in capturing the German post. On 4 April, Jensen was promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a>. His award of the Victoria Cross appeared in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 8 June, by which time the 50th Battalion was involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>, suffering 149 casualties. After being relieved, the battalion continued its rotation through front line, support and reserve positions.

In July 1917, Jensen was temporarily promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a> and transferred to the 13th Training Battalion at <a href="Codford">Codford</a> in the UK as an instructor. While there he was entertained by Danish residents of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a>. After another disciplinary infringement, he returned to France, rejoining his battalion on 6 October. He was temporarily promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> in early November, and the battalion went through the winter of 1917–18 rotating through the front line. In late March 1918, the battalion left its rest area and along with many other Australian units was quickly deployed to meet the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> south of the River <a href="Ancre">Ancre</a>. On 5 April, the battalion took up positions at <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a> and there contributed to the defeat of the "largest German attack mounted against Australian troops during the war" during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Dernancourt">Second Battle of Dernancourt</a>.

The fighting at Dernancourt was followed by a move to the <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a> sector, where, on 25 April, the battalion was part of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Villers-Bretonneux">Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux</a> that drove the Germans from that village, at a cost to the battalion of 254 casualties. On 5 May, Jensen was on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux when he was shot in the head. Severely wounded, he was admitted to hospital in France, and on 18 May was evacuated to the UK, where he was admitted to the Richmond Military Hospital in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>.

Jensen reverted to the rank of corporal on being evacuated. Following two weeks' leave, he was repatriated to Australia along with nine other Victoria Cross recipients in August 1918, to take part in a recruiting campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>. He disembarked in Adelaide on 11 October, and was discharged from the AIF on 2 December. He was assessed to be partially disabled, and received a small pension. For his service during the war, as well as his Victoria Cross he was issued the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Star">1914–15 Star</a>, <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a> and <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a>.

After his discharge, Jensen worked for a short time as a barman in <a href="Truro%2C%20South%20Australia">Truro</a>, then as a marine store dealer in Adelaide. He married Katy Herman ( Arthur), a divorcée, at the Adelaide Registry Office on 13 July 1921. Their marriage was heavily affected by his wartime experiences. In April 1922, a photograph of Jensen and his horse-drawn cart, with "J. C. Jensen V.C." painted on the side, was published on the front page of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times%20%28Sydney%29">The Sunday Times</a>" newspaper in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>; the caption noted that he employed several men in his business. On 28 May, Jensen was admitted to the <a href="Royal%20Adelaide%20Hospital">Adelaide Hospital</a>, and died of congestion of the lungs three days later, aged 31.

On 2 June, his casket was carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage to the <a href="West%20Terrace%20Cemetery">West Terrace Cemetery</a>, followed by hundreds of former members of the 50th Battalion, and he was buried with full military honours in the AIF section of the cemetery. It was reported as "one of the most impressive funerals which have passed through the gates of the West Terrace Cemetery", and "probably one of the largest military funerals ever held in Adelaide". The pastor at the service said that Jensen was, "modest always... ever ready to enlarge on the bravery of others, without touching on his own accomplishments". His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was donated by a family member to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in 1987 at a ceremony attended by <a href="Margrethe%20II%20of%20Denmark">Queen Margrethe II of Denmark</a>, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour of the memorial. In 2006, a memorial to Jensen was unveiled in Løgstør by the Australian ambassador to Denmark, and a book about him was published in Denmark in the same year. Each year wreaths are placed at the memorial in memory of Jensen, and in 2014 a wreath was placed by the Australian ambassador, <a href="Damien%20Miller">Damien Miller</a>.

Last voyage of the Karluk

The last voyage of the "Karluk", flagship of the <a href="Canadian%20Arctic%20Expedition%201913-1916">Canadian Arctic Expedition</a> of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, <a href="HMCS%20Karluk">"Karluk"</a>, a <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a> formerly used as a <a href="whaler">whaler</a>, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at <a href="Herschel%20Island">Herschel Island</a>. After a long drift across the <a href="Beaufort%20Sea">Beaufort</a> and <a href="Chukchi%20Sea">Chukchi</a> seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a>. In all, eleven men died before rescue.

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist <a href="Vilhjalmur%20Stefansson">Vilhjalmur Stefansson</a>, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after "Karluk" was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for <a href="Reindeer">caribou</a>. However, the ice carried "Karluk" westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, <a href="Robert%20Bartlett%20%28explorer%29">Robert Bartlett</a>. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a>, away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached.

From the island, Bartlett and an <a href="Inuit">Inuk</a> companion set out across the frozen sea for the <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued.

Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the loss of their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking "Karluk" into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former "Karluk" shipmates.

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was the brainchild of <a href="Vilhjalmur%20Stefansson">Vilhjalmur Stefansson</a>, a US-based, Canadian-born anthropologist of Icelandic extraction who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada. His fieldwork had resulted in the first detailed information on the life and culture of the <a href="Copper%20Inuit">Copper Inuit</a>, the so-called "<a href="blond%20Eskimos">blond Eskimos</a>". Stefansson had returned home with plans for another expedition to continue his Arctic studies, and obtained promises of financial backing totalling US$45,000 (around US$750,000 in 2010) from the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> (NGS) in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> and the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. However, he wanted to extend his plans to include geographical exploration in the <a href="Beaufort%20Sea">Beaufort Sea</a>, then a blank space on the world's maps. For these expanded aims he needed more money, and approached the Canadian government for assistance.

The area known as the "High Arctic" was subject to claims of sovereignty not only from Canada, but also from Norway and the United States. The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when the Canadian prime minister <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a> met Stefansson in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition. Borden's government was hopeful that the expedition would strengthen <a href="Territorial%20claims%20in%20the%20Arctic">Canada's claim</a> to sovereignty over the <a href="Canadian%20Arctic%20Archipelago">Arctic islands</a>. The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913. This created a narrow deadline and hurried preparations for the journey north, although Stefansson maintained in his 1921 account that "forethought appeared to have anticipated every eventuality".

The Canadian government's financial involvement represented a shift in the expedition's emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies. In a letter to the Canadian "<a href="Times-Colonist">Victoria Daily Times</a>", Stefansson set out these separate aims. The main object was to explore the "area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the North Pole". The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted. While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist <a href="Rudolph%20Martin%20Anderson">Rudolph Anderson</a> would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.

The Northern Party's ship, "Karluk", would proceed north from the Canadian coast until it either found land or was stopped by ice. It would explore any land it encountered; otherwise it would follow the ice edge eastward and attempt to winter at either <a href="Banks%20Island">Banks Island</a> or <a href="Prince%20Patrick%20Island">Prince Patrick Island</a>. If the ship was trapped in the ice and forced to drift, the party would study the direction of Arctic currents and carry out oceanographic research. Meanwhile, Rudolph Anderson's party was expected to continue with the anthropological studies of the "blond Eskimo", to collect varieties of Arctic flora and fauna, to carry out geological research, and to seek open-water channels in the hope of establishing new trade routes.

Stefansson's plan was to take the expedition to the old whaling station at Herschel Island off the Canadian Arctic coast, where the final composition of the Northern and Southern Parties would be decided and where equipment and supplies would be divided among the different strands of the venture. The haste to meet the NGS deadline led to concerns among the expedition's members about the adequacy of the provision of food, clothing and equipment. Stefansson, who was largely absent in the hectic weeks immediately before sailing and who revealed few of his plans to his team, dismissed such concerns as "impertinent and disloyal". There were disputes between Stefansson and the scientists over the chain of command; the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Canadian Geological Survey</a>, which had provided four scientists to the expedition, wanted these men to report to them rather than to Stefansson. Southern Party leader Rudolph Anderson threatened to resign over Stefansson's claim to the publication rights of all private expedition journals.

The scientific team, made up of some of the most distinguished men in their fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire. Only two, however, had previous polar experience: <a href="Alistair%20Mackay">Alistair Forbes Mackay</a>, the expedition's medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s <a href="Nimrod%20Expedition">"Nimrod" expedition</a> in 1907–09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the <a href="South%20Magnetic%20Pole">South Magnetic Pole</a>. Another "Nimrod" veteran, the 46-year-old <a href="James%20Murray%20%28biologist%29">James Murray</a>, was Stefansson's oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay (1889–1983), a 24-year-old science teacher from <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> who was recommended by the Scottish explorer <a href="William%20Speirs%20Bruce">William Speirs Bruce</a>, and Bjarne Mamen (1893–1914), a 20-year-old skiing champion from <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a>, Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience.

Stefansson had wanted American whaling skipper <a href="Christian%20Theodore%20Pedersen">Christian Theodore Pedersen</a> to captain "Karluk", the ship designated for the Northern Party. When Pedersen withdrew, the captaincy was offered to 36-year-old <a href="Colony%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>-born <a href="Robert%20Bartlett%20%28explorer%29">Robert Bartlett</a>, an experienced polar navigator who had commanded <a href="Robert%20Peary">Robert Peary</a>'s ship, , on the Peary's 1906 and 1909 polar expeditions. Bartlett did not have time, however, to select "Karluk's" crew, which was hurriedly assembled from around the <a href="Esquimalt%20Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard">Royal Navy Dockyard</a> at <a href="Esquimalt%2C%20British%20Columbia">Esquimalt</a> in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. McKinlay later wrote of the crew that "one was a confirmed drug addict ... another suffered from venereal disease; and in spite of orders that no liquor was to be carried, at least two smuggled supplies on board." McKinlay worried that this crew might lack the qualities and character necessary in the arduous months ahead, concerns shared by Bartlett, whose first act on arrival in Esquimalt was to fire the first officer for incompetence. In his place he appointed the 22-year-old Alexander "Sandy" Anderson.

"Karluk" had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000. Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, "Karluk" was "the soundest and best adapted for our purpose", but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a>, was in length with a beam of . She had been built for the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian</a> fishing industry ("karluk" is the <a href="Aleut%20language">Aleut</a> word for "fish") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with <a href="Erythrophleum%20chlorostachys">Australian ironwood</a>. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.

The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to "Karluk", Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, "Alaska", to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, "Mary Sachs", when the hold space in "Alaska" proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and <a href="Diamond%20Jenness">Diamond Jenness</a>, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with "Karluk", while their equipment was on board "Alaska". McKinlay himself, aboard "Karluk" as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with "Alaska". Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.

"Karluk" left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The immediate destination was <a href="Nome%2C%20Alaska">Nome</a>, on the coast of the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a>. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July "Karluk" reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined "Alaska" and "Mary Sachs". While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected "Karluk" to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.

At <a href="Port%20Clarence%2C%20Alaska">Port Clarence</a>, just north of Nome, 28 dogs were taken on board before "Karluk" sailed north on 27 July. The next day she crossed the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, and almost immediately encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and seasickness. However, McKinlay noted that "whatever defects she had, "Karluk" was proving herself a fine sea-boat." On 31 July they reached <a href="Point%20Hope%2C%20Alaska">Point Hope</a>, where two Inuit hunters, known as "Jerry" and "Jimmy", joined the ship. On 1 August the permanent Arctic <a href="Drift%20ice">ice pack</a> was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back. On 2 August, about from <a href="Point%20Barrow">Point Barrow</a>, "Karluk" thrust her way into the ice but was soon trapped, and drifted slowly eastward for three days before reaching open water off Cape Smythe. Meanwhile, Stefansson had left to travel over the ice to Point Barrow. He rejoined the ship at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east. Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson's, was entered in the ship's books as carpenter.

At Cape Smythe two more Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, together with Keraluk's family—wife Keruk and their two young daughters Helen and Mugpi. As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly anxious about the extent of ice in the area, and noted that the brass stemplates on the ship's bow had already been damaged. Over the next few days "Karluk" struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water. The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray's <a href="Marine%20biology%20dredge">dredging</a> operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular <a href="Sounding%20line">depth soundings</a>. On 13 August Bartlett calculated their position as east of Point Barrow, with a similar distance to travel to Herschel Island. This proved to be the ship's farthest point east, as at that position she became firmly trapped in the ice and began to move slowly westward; by 10 September "Karluk" had retreated nearly back towards Point Barrow. Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that "Karluk" would have to winter in the ice.

On 19 September, with "Karluk" ice-bound and largely stationary, Stefansson announced that in view of the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game in the area of the <a href="Colville%20River%20%28Alaska%29">Colville River</a>. He would take with him the two Inuit "Jimmy" and "Jerry", the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer <a href="George%20Hubert%20Wilkins">George Wilkins</a>, and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness. Stefansson expected to be gone for about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should "send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship's whereabouts." The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the <a href="Sea%20ice">ice floe</a> in which "Karluk" was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between a day—but to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and from Stefansson's party who, it soon became clear, would not be able to find their way back to the ship.

In an unpublished journal and later correspondence, McKinlay suggested that Stefansson's departure amounted to abandoning the ship to its fate. The expedition's historian S.E. Jenness (son of Diamond Jenness) rejects this view, pointing out that Stefansson and the hunting party members had left valuable property aboard "Karluk"; a possible motive for the trip, Jenness surmises, was to train the younger staff. The anthropologist Gísli Pálsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, there is no evidence that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men. It is arguable, Pálsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, should "Karluk" be trapped in the ice for a long time. The historian Richard Diubaldo writes "The evidence suggests that this was a normal hunting trip" and "... there is strong evidence to suggest he [Stefansson] wished he had never left [the ship]".
The constant snow and thick mists made it difficult for Bartlett to calculate the "Karluk's" position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August. On 3 October the anxiety of crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just distant, the drift turned northwards, away from the land. There were fears among some that "Karluk" would repeat the experience of the "<a href="USS%20Jeannette%20%281878%29">Jeannette</a>", an American vessel that 30 years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew. Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's "Nimrod" expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.

As the weather grew worse Bartlett ordered supplies and equipment to be transferred onto the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry. Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts—two or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay—and by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid-November. On 15 November "Karluk" reached 73°N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, in the general direction of the Siberian coast. By mid-December the estimated position was from <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a>. Despite the bleak outlook—Bartlett was privately convinced that "Karluk" would not survive the winter— a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet. By then they were just north of <a href="Herald%20Island%20%28Arctic%29">Herald Island</a>, a rocky outpost east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was visible in the distance, though whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear. The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming <a href="Pressure%20ridge%20%28ice%29">pressure ridges</a>. Over the next few days, wrote McKinlay, "the twanging, drumming, ominous ice sounds got louder and nearer."

Early in the morning of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, "a severe shudder shook the whole ship" as the ice attacked the hull. Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks. He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready. At 6.45 in the evening a loud bang indicated that the hull had been punctured; Bartlett went immediately to the engine room and observed water pouring in through a gash long. There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship. Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could hardly have been worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stored on the ice. Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship's <a href="Victor%20Talking%20Machine%20Company%23The%20Victrola">Victrola</a>. At 3:15 p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Chopin's Funeral March</a> as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off. "Karluk" sank within minutes, her <a href="Yard%20%28sailing%29">yardarms</a> snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice. McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat.

Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as "Shipwreck Camp", was more or less established by the time "Karluk" sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow <a href="igloo">igloo</a> with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from "Karluk's" engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided "substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time." Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.

Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by "Karluk's" first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably <a href="Herald%20Island%20%28Arctic%29">Herald Island</a>, from their intended destination. This was the last sighting of Anderson's party; their ultimate fate was not established until ten years later, when their remains were found on Herald Island.

Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.

Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.
Bartlett's party now consisted of eight "Karluk" crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the family of four and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, was one of the few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.

The ice surface was very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties were able to travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had destroyed much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept. On 28 February all the parties came together in front of the first of a series of high ridges, from in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5 km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome. Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.

Bartlett's initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native <a href="Chukchi%20people">Chukchi people</a>, and feared for his life. Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward.
On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan, west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast. The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area. They followed these tracks for a day, before arriving at a small Chukchi village. Here, contrary to Kataktovik's fears, they were received hospitably, and given shelter and food. On 7 April they set out for <a href="Cape%20Dezhnev">East Cape</a>. Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather, with blizzards, hurricane-force winds, and temperatures often below . On the way they passed through several Chukchi villages, where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies—he exchanged his <a href="Colt%27s%20Manufacturing%20Company">Colt revolver</a> for a young, strong dog. Bartlett was touched by the kindness and generosity shown by many of those they encountered on the way, "typical of the true humanity of these kindly people". On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town, a settlement a few miles west of East Cape. Bartlett calculated that in the 37 days since leaving Wrangel Island, he and Kataktovik had travelled about , all but the last stage on foot.

At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a distinguished Russian official who offered to take him to <a href="Providence%20Bay%2C%20Siberia">Emma Harbour</a> on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of <a href="tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler "Herman" and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at <a href="St.%20Michael%2C%20Alaska">St Michael</a>, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of "Karluk's" fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the <a href="United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service">United States revenue cutter</a> <a href="USS%20Bear%20%281874%29">"Bear"</a>, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.

The landfall from Shipwreck Camp had been on the north side of Wrangel Island, at a spot which they named "Icy Spit". Before his departure, Bartlett asked the party to set up several camps around the island, which would increase the hunting areas. The captain also felt that separation into smaller groups would assist general harmony by keeping incompatible characters apart. He wanted all groups to reassemble at Rodgers Harbor, on the south side of the island, about the middle of July.

However, dissension broke out almost immediately after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were shortages of biscuit, <a href="pemmican">pemmican</a> (a compound of dried meat, fat and sugar) and dog food. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil. McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: "The misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold."

Two attempts were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.

Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a "frightful smell", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.

From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of <a href="seal%20meat">seal meat</a> dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson "Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported." Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions "hallucinations and absolutely untrue." Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.

Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of <a href="Dominion%20Day%23Canada">Dominion Day</a>. Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days. As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.

The revenue cutter "Bear" arrived in St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, agreed to go to Wrangel Island as soon as he got permission from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, "Bear", with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving "Karluk" the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.

McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome aboard <a href="King%20%26amp%3B%20Winge%20%28fishing%20schooner%29">"King and Winge"</a>, an American-registered walrus hunter, while "Bear" finally sailed for Wrangel Island. On 25 August "Bear" was stopped by ice from the island, and after failing to force a way through, Cochran had to return to Nome for more coal—a decision which, says Bartlett, gave him "days to try a man's soul". Back in Nome Bartlett met <a href="Olaf%20Swenson">Olaf Swenson</a>, who had chartered "King and Winge" for the season and was about to sail for Siberia. Bartlett requested that, if possible, "King and Winge" stop by Wrangel Island and look for the stranded "Karluk" party. "Bear" left Nome on 4 September, a few days after Swenson's ship. "King and Winge", with McConnell still aboard, reached Wrangel Island on 7 September. That morning the group at Rodgers Harbor were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a ship's whistle, and found "King and Winge" lying a quarter of a mile offshore. They were rapidly transferred to the ship, which then picked up the remainder of the stranded party who were camped along the coast at Cape Waring. By the afternoon all 14 survivors were aboard.

After a futile attempt to approach Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; next day she encountered "Bear", with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard "Bear". Before returning to Alaska, "Bear" made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.

Bartlett, celebrated as a hero by press and public, was honoured for "outstanding bravery" by the <a href="Royal%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Geographical Society</a>. However, he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking "Karluk" into the ice, and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group—despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility. Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct. Bartlett resumed his career at sea, and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic. During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946. His account of the "Karluk" disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.

In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years' absence, reporting the discovery of three new islands. He was honoured by the National Geographical Society, received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and <a href="Adolphus%20Greely">Adolphus Greely</a>, and was given the presidency of the <a href="Explorers%20Club">Explorers Club</a> of New York. In Canada his reception was more muted; there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition, its poor initial organisation, and his handling of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, completed its work independently of Stefansson. Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book "The Friendly Arctic", which they felt reflected poorly on their honour. The request was declined on the ground that "no good could come of the enquiry." In his book Stefansson takes responsibility for the "bold" decision to take "Karluk" into the ice rather than hugging the coast on the way to Herschel Island, and accepts that he "chose the wrong alternative". However, McKinlay felt that the book gave an inaccurate account of the "Karluk" voyage and its consequences, "putting the blame ... on everyone but Vilhjalmur Stefansson." The historian Tom Henighan believes that McKinlay's biggest complaint against his leader was that "Stefansson never at any time seemed able to express an appropriate sorrow over his lost men." Stefansson, who never returned to the Arctic, died in 1962 at the age of 82.

The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party remained unknown until 1924, when an American vessel landed at Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established that this was Anderson's party. No cause of death was established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> within the tent.

The mystery illness which affected most of the Wrangel Island party and accelerated the deaths of Malloch and Mamen was later diagnosed as a form of <a href="nephritis">nephritis</a> brought about by eating faulty pemmican. Stefansson explained this by saying that "our pemmican makers has failed us through supplying us with a product deficient in fat." Peary had emphasised that a polar explorer should "give his personal, constant and insistent attention" to the making of his pemmican; McKinlay believed that Stefansson had devoted too much time selling the idea of the expedition, and too little ensuring the quality of the food that its members would depend upon.

Of the survivors, Hadley continued working for the Canadian Arctic Expedition, becoming second officer and later master of the supply ship "Polar Bear". He died of influenza, in San Francisco in 1918. Hadley and McConnell wrote accounts of their experiences for Stefansson, who incorporated them in "The Friendly Arctic". Chafe also wrote and published a short account. Most of the others quickly returned to relative obscurity, but in 1922, Fred Maurer was persuaded by Stefansson to join an attempt to colonise Wrangel Island. To the embarrassment of the Canadian government, Stefansson insisted on going ahead, even though Wrangel Island was indisputably part of what had then become the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. A party of five, including Maurer, was sent to the island; only one, an Inuit woman <a href="Ada%20Blackjack">Ada Blackjack</a>, survived. Despite their ordeal, many of the "Karluk" survivors lived long lives; Williamson, who declined to speak or write of his experiences in the Arctic, lived to be 97, dying in Victoria, Canada, in 1975. McKinlay died in 1983, aged 95, having published his account of the expedition in 1976. Kuraluk, Kuruk and their daughters, Helen and Mugpi, returned to their former life at Point Barrow. The two girls, says Pálsson, had provided "important sources of cheer at the darkest moments." Mugpi, who later was known as Ruth Makpii Ipalook, became the very last survivor of the "Karluk" voyage, dying in 2008 after a full life, aged 97.

Six first-hand accounts of "Karluk's" last voyage have been published. These include Stefansson's account which only covers the June to September 1913 period. Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote an account of the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in "The New York Times", 15 September 1914. A version of McConnell's account appears in Stefansson's book.

The Quatermass Experiment

The Quatermass Experiment is a British <a href="Science%20fiction%20on%20television">science-fiction serial</a> broadcast by <a href="BBC%20One">BBC Television</a> during the summer of 1953 and re-staged by <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> in 2005. Set in the near future against the background of a <a href="British%20space%20programme">British space programme</a>, it tells the story of the first manned flight into space, supervised by <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Experimental Rocket Group. 

When the <a href="spaceship">spaceship</a> that carried the first successful crew returns to Earth, two of the three <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s are missing, and the third – Victor Carroon – is behaving strangely. It becomes apparent that an <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a> presence entered the ship during its flight, and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world.

Originally comprising six half-hour episodes, it was the first science-fiction production to be written especially for an adult television audience in Britain. Previous written-for-television efforts such as "Stranger from Space" (1951–52) were aimed at children, whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources, such as "<a href="R.U.R.%20%28Rossum%27s%20Universal%20Robots%29">R.U.R.</a>" (1938 and again in 1948) and "<a href="The%20Time%20Machine">The Time Machine</a>" (1949). The serial was the first of four "<a href="Quatermass">Quatermass</a>" productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979, and was transmitted live from the BBC's original television studios at <a href="Alexandra%20Palace">Alexandra Palace</a> in London, one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London.

As well as spawning various remakes and sequels, "The Quatermass Experiment" inspired much of the television science fiction that succeeded it, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it influenced successful series such as "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" and "<a href="Sapphire%20and%20Steel">Sapphire and Steel</a>". It also influenced successful <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> films such as "" and "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>".

The serial was written by <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television drama writer <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a>, who had been an actor and an award-winning fiction writer before joining the BBC. The BBC's Head of Television Drama, <a href="Michael%20Barry%20%28television%20producer%29">Michael Barry</a>, had committed most of his original script budget for the year to employing Kneale. An interest in science, particularly the idea of 'science going bad', led Kneale to write "The Quatermass Experiment". The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC's schedules for a six-week serial to run on Saturday nights during the summer of 1953, and Kneale's idea was to fill it with "a mystifying, rather than horrific" storyline.

<a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a>, one of the BBC's best-regarded directors, directed the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play "<a href="Arrow%20to%20the%20Heart">Arrow to the Heart</a>", and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a <a href="London">London</a> <a href="telephone%20directory">telephone directory</a>. He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer <a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a>. The working titles for the production were "The Unbegotten" and "Bring Something Back...!", the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted. The production had an overall budget of just under £4000. The theme music used was "Mars, Bringer of War" from <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>'s "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>".

Each episode was <a href="Rehearsal">rehearsed</a> from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on <a href="Gower%20Street%20%28London%29">Gower Street</a> in London, with camera rehearsals taking place all day on Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then transmitted <a href="live%20television">live</a>—with a few pre-filmed <a href="35mm%20film">35mm film</a> inserts shot before and during the rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at <a href="Alexandra%20Palace">Alexandra Palace</a> in London. It was one of the last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to <a href="Lime%20Grove%20Studios">Lime Grove Studios</a>, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.

"The Quatermass Experiment" was transmitted weekly on Saturday night from 18 July to 22 August 1953. Episode one ("Contact Has Been Established") was scheduled from 8.15 to 8.45 p.m.; episode two ("Persons Reported Missing"), 8.25–8.55 p.m.; episodes three and four ("Very Special Knowledge" and "Believed to be Suffering"), 8.45–9.15 p.m.; and the final two episodes ("An Unidentified Species" and "State of Emergency") from 9.00 to 9.30 p.m. Due to the live performances, each episode overran its slot slightly, from two minutes (episode four) to six (episode six). The long overrun of the final episode was caused by a temporary break in transmission to replace a failing microphone. Kneale later claimed that the BBC's transmission controllers had threatened to take them off the air during one significant overrun, to which Cartier replied, "Just let them try!" Some BBC documentation suggests that at least one transmitter region did cut short the broadcast of the final episode.

The BBC intended that each episode be <a href="telerecording">telerecorded</a> onto <a href="35mm%20film">35mm film</a>, a relatively new process that allowed for the preservation of live television broadcasts. Sale of the serial had been provisionally agreed with the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, and Cartier wanted the material available to use for <a href="trailer%20%28film%29">trailers</a> and <a href="%3Awikt%3Arecapitulation">recaps</a>. Only poor-quality copies of the first two episodes were recorded before the idea was abandoned, although the first of these was later shown in Canada. During the telerecording of the second episode, an insect landed on the screen being filmed, and can be seen on the image for several minutes. It is very unlikely that material from the third to sixth episodes of the serial will ever be recovered to the BBC's archives. The two existing episodes are the oldest surviving examples of a multi-episodic British drama production, and some of the earliest existing examples of British television drama at all, with only a few earlier one-off plays surviving.

In November 1953, it was suggested that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter part of the story for a special Christmas <a href="Omnibus%20%28broadcast%29">omnibus</a> repeat of the serial. This idea was abandoned. Although Cartier and star <a href="Reginald%20Tate">Reginald Tate</a> were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the <a href="National%20Film%20Theatre">National Film Theatre</a> in London.

Along with his laboratory assistants, <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> anxiously awaits the return to Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by <a href="radar">radar</a> and returns to Earth, crash-landing in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon, London</a>.

When Quatermass and his team reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they discover that only one of the three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (<a href="Hugh%20Kelly%20%28actor%29">Hugh Kelly</a>) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but there is no sign of the other two crewmen.

Carroon, gravely ill, is cared for by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (<a href="John%20Glen%20%28actor%29">John Glen</a>), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (<a href="Isabel%20Dean">Isabel Dean</a>). It is not just Quatermass who is interested in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (<a href="Paul%20Whitsun-Jones">Paul Whitsun-Jones</a>) and <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>'s Inspector Lomax (<a href="Ian%20Colin">Ian Colin</a>) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted by a group of foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien organism</a>.

As the police chase the rapidly transforming Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses samples of the mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it has the ability to end all life on Earth if it <a href="spore">spore</a>s. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, and Quatermass and troops of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.
Following the success of "The Quatermass Experiment", <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a> became one of the best-regarded <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>s in the history of British television. In addition to the various "Quatermass" spin-offs and sequels, he wrote acclaimed productions such as "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" (1954) and "<a href="The%20Stone%20Tape">The Stone Tape</a>" (1972). A tribute article by writer and admirer <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, published on the <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a> website shortly after Kneale's death in 2006, praised his contribution to British television history. "He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>, as <a href="David%20Mercer%20%28playwright%29">David Mercer</a>, as <a href="Alan%20Bleasdale">Alan Bleasdale</a>, as <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>."

Kneale's actions were represented on screen in the final episode of "The Quatermass Experiment". He manipulated the monster seen in Westminster Abbey at the climax, with his hands stuck through a photographic blow-up of the interior of the Abbey. The monster actually consisted of gloves covered in various plant and other materials, prepared by Kneale and his girlfriend (and future wife) <a href="Judith%20Kerr">Judith Kerr</a>. The couple kept the gloves as a memento, and still owned them fifty years later, when Kneale wore them again in a television documentary about his career.

<a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a> had emigrated from Germany in the 1930s to escape its <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> regime, and joined the staff of the BBC the year before "The Quatermass Experiment" was made. He collaborated with Kneale on several further productions, and became a major figure in the British television industry. He directed important productions such as Kneale's "Nineteen Eighty-Four" adaptation, the two further BBC "Quatermass" serials, and one-off plays such as "Cross of Iron" (1961) and "Lee Oswald: Assassin" (1966). His 1994 obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" praised his contribution to 1950s television drama: "At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension." The same piece also named "The Quatermass Experiment" as a high point in his career, calling the serial "a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb."

Quatermass was played by the experienced <a href="Reginald%20Tate">Reginald Tate</a>, who had appeared in various films, including "<a href="The%20Way%20Ahead">The Way Ahead</a>" (1944). He died two years later, while preparing to take the role of the Professor again in "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>". Tate was the second choice for the part; Cartier had previously offered it to <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Morell">André Morell</a>, who declined the role. (Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>".) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor <a href="Duncan%20Lamont">Duncan Lamont</a>, who later appeared in the film "<a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty%20%281962%20film%29">Mutiny on the Bounty</a>" (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit%20%28film%29">Quatermass and the Pit</a>" (1967). He enjoyed working on "The Quatermass Experiment" so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their 'monster' prop.

Appearing in a small role as a drunk was <a href="Wilfrid%20Brambell">Wilfrid Brambell</a>, who later appeared as a <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">tramp</a> in "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>". Brambell, who also appeared in Cartier and Kneale's production of "Nineteen Eighty-Four", later became widely known for his roles in the <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="Steptoe%20and%20Son">Steptoe and Son</a>" (1962–74) and the film "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28film%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>" (1964). The 74-year-old actress <a href="Katie%20Johnson%20%28English%20actress%29">Katie Johnson</a> played a supporting part; she later became well known and won a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Film Award</a> for her role as the landlady Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce in the film "<a href="The%20Ladykillers">The Ladykillers</a>" (1955).

"The Quatermass Experiment" achieved favourable viewing figures in 1953, opening with an estimated audience of 3.4 million for the first episode, increasing to 5 million for the sixth and final episode, and averaging 3.9 million for the entire serial. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" estimated that one year before "The Quatermass Experiment" was broadcast, in August 1952, the total television audience consisted of about 4 million people. In March of that year, the BBC estimated that an average of 2.25 million people watched BBC programmes each evening.

In 1954 <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a>, the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, referred to the success of the serial in a memo discussing the impending launch of a new commercial television channel, ending the BBC's <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a>. "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while "The Quatermass Experiment" lasted. We are going to need "many" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes." Following Kneale's death in 2006, film historian Robert Simpson said that the serial had been "<a href="event%20television">event television</a>, emptying the streets and pubs for the six weeks of its duration." When the <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> channel <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> remade the serial in 2005, the channel's controller, <a href="Janice%20Hadlow">Janice Hadlow</a>, described the original as "one the first 'must-watch' TV experiences that inspired the water cooler chat of its day".

Viewers' responses were generally positive. Letters praising the production were sent to the BBC's <a href="listings%20magazine">listings magazine</a>, the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>", while the writer and producer were also applauded by readers of "TV News" magazine, which nominated them for one of the publication's "TV Bouquet" awards. Looking back at "The Quatermass Experiment" in a 1981 article for "The Times", journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale:"Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of 1953 but it was not just the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">Coronation</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Queen</a> that sticks in my mind now. It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… "The Quatermass Experiment" frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass was one of the first series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying."
Subsequent audience research showed that technical problems interrupting the final episode's broadcast had a negative impact on audiences' views of the serial; the audience felt that the climax had been spoiled.

Despite such problems—and the existence of only the first two episodes in the archives—"The Quatermass Experiment" continued to earn critical praise in the decades following its transmission. The <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s "<a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>" website describes the serial as "one of the most influential series of the 1950s", adding that "with its originality, mass appeal and dynamism, "The Quatermass Experiment" became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television." The website of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Broadcast%20Communications">Museum of Broadcast Communications</a> praises the serial's underlying themes as its most effective feature. ""The Quatermass Experiment"'s depiction of an Englishman's transformation into an alienated monster dramatized a new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security. As a result, or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier's effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama, audiences were captivated." The website also points to the programme's influence on the British science-fiction television productions that followed, claiming that "with ["The Quatermass Experiment"] began a British tradition of science fiction television which runs in various forms from "Quatermass" to "<a href="A%20for%20Andromeda">A for Andromeda</a>" to "<a href="Blake%27s%207">Blake's 7</a>", and from "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" to "<a href="Red%20Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a>"."

Kneale disliked "Doctor Who"—the most successful of the British science-fiction programmes—saying that it had stolen his ideas. An article for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" in 2005 described "Doctor Who" as the "spiritual successor" to the "Quatermass" serials, and <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, a scriptwriter for "Doctor Who", wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in 2006. "Kneale wrote that [1953] was 'an over-confident year' and he piloted his hugely influential tale like a rocket into the drab schedules of Austerity Britain… What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?"

In 2007, Gatiss appeared as the character Professor Lazarus in the "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="The%20Lazarus%20Experiment">The Lazarus Experiment</a>". The "Radio Times" noted in its preview of the episode that "Tonight's story is an enjoyable synthesis of "<a href="She%20%28novel%29">She</a>", "<a href="The%20Fly%20%281958%20film%29">The Fly</a>" and "The Quatermass Experiment"—even down to the final battle in a London cathedral."

The popularity of "The Quatermass Experiment" gained the attention of the <a href="film">film</a> industry, and <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a>, supported by the English actor <a href="Jack%20Warner%20%28actor%29">Jack Warner</a>, with <a href="Val%20Guest">Val Guest</a> directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass. He stated in an interview, "[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." The film was titled "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Xperiment">The Quatermass Xperiment</a>" to emphasise its <a href="X-rated%23United%20Kingdom">X-certificate</a> status. In America the film was renamed "The Creeping Unknown" after the title "Shock!" was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared.

The BBC was also pleased with the success of "The Quatermass Experiment" and in 1955 a sequel, "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>", was broadcast, with <a href="John%20Robinson%20%28English%20actor%29">John Robinson</a> in the title role following Tate's death. This was followed in 1958 by "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>", and both serials also had feature film versions made by Hammer. The character returned to television in a 1979 serial, simply titled "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%29">Quatermass</a>", for <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>.

A script book of "The Quatermass Experiment", containing several production stills from the missing episodes, was published by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in 1959. To coincide with the broadcast of the Thames serial, it was republished in 1979 with a new introduction by Kneale.

In April 2005, <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> released a <a href="box%20set">boxed set</a> of all their "Quatermass" material on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, containing digitally restored versions of the two existing episodes of "The Quatermass Experiment", the two subsequent BBC serials, and various extra material, including <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">PDF</a> files of photocopies of the original scripts for episodes three to six. However, the quality of these photocopies is in some cases quite poor.

On 2 April 2005, the <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> channel <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> broadcast a live remake of the serial, abridged to a single special, also entitled "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment%20%28film%29">The Quatermass Experiment</a>".

Quatermass II

Quatermass II is a British <a href="Science%20fiction%20on%20television">science-fiction</a> <a href="Serial%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">serial</a>, originally broadcast by <a href="BBC%20One">BBC Television</a> in the autumn of 1955. It is the second in the "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">Quatermass</a>" series by writer <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a>, and the oldest of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives.

The serial sees <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Experimental Rocket Group being asked to examine strange <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a> showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a> infiltration at the highest levels of the British government. As even some of Quatermass's closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a <a href="Nuclear%20and%20radiation%20accidents">nuclear disaster</a> at an Australian testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind.

Although sometimes compared unfavourably to the first and third "Quatermass" serials, "Quatermass II" was praised for its allegorical concerns of the damaging effects of <a href="industrialisation">industrialisation</a> and the corruption of governments by <a href="big%20business">big business</a>. It is described on the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a> website as "compulsive viewing."

On 22 September 1955 the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network was launched in the UK, bringing <a href="Commercial%20broadcasting">commercial television</a> to Britain for the first time and ending the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s broadcasting <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> in the country. The new network's creation had been established by the <a href="Television%20Act%201954">Television Act 1954</a>, and the BBC had known in advance that it would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>" in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television's Controller of Programmes, <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a>, noted that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while ["The Quatermass Experiment"] lasted. We are going to need "many" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes."

Having recently signed a two-year extension to his BBC staff writer's contract, Nigel Kneale was specifically commissioned to write a sequel to "The Quatermass Experiment" in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret <a href="UK%20Ministry%20of%20Defence">UK Ministry of Defence</a> research establishments such as <a href="Porton%20Down">Porton Down</a>, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a>. As with "The Quatermass Experiment", "Quatermass II" was produced and directed by <a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a>; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first "Quatermass" serial, the two men had collaborated on the literary adaptations "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights">Wuthering Heights</a>" (1953) and "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" (1954), and on Kneale's <a href="Yeti">abominable snowman</a> play "The Creature" (1955).

"Quatermass II" comprised six half-hour episodes, transmitted <a href="live%20television">live</a> from Studio G at the BBC's <a href="Lime%20Grove%20Studios">Lime Grove Studios</a> in London. The episodes — individually subtitled "The Bolts", "The Mark", "The Food", "The Coming", "The Frenzy" and "The Destroyers" — were shown every Saturday night at 8 p.m. from 22 October to 26 November 1955; because of the live nature of the performances, most of the episodes overran their allotted half-hour slots slightly. Each episode was <a href="rehearsal">rehearsed</a> on the Monday to Friday before transmission at Mansergh Woodall Boys Club in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, London, and then camera rehearsed in studio for most of the day on the Saturday.

Not every scene was performed live; because of the increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on "The Quatermass Experiment" — Cartier was able to include a larger proportion of pre-filmed inserts on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a>, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot <a href="Filming%20location">on location</a> at the <a href="Shell%20Haven">Shell Haven</a> <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> in <a href="Stanford-le-Hope">Stanford-le-Hope</a>, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural <a href="Essex">Essex</a> for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction <a href="BBC%20Television%20Centre">BBC Television Centre</a> in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.

Each episode of "Quatermass II" was <a href="Telerecording">telerecorded</a> onto 35 mm film during its live transmission, for a scheduled repeat the following Monday night at 10:15 p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies in some cases suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. "Quatermass II" was one of the first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.

Episode three, "The Food", was repeated in a slightly edited form on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC 2</a> on 26 August 1991 as part of "The Lime Grove Story". This was a day of programming to commemorate the closure of the studios after 40 years of use by the BBC.

<a href="Reginald%20Tate">Reginald Tate</a>, who had played the title role in "The Quatermass Experiment", collapsed and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This was less than a month before the shooting of the location filming for "Quatermass II" began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; <a href="John%20Robinson%20%28English%20actor%29">John Robinson</a> was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.

Appearing as Quatermass's chief assistant Dr Leo Pugh was Welsh actor <a href="Hugh%20Griffith">Hugh Griffith</a>. Griffith had been an actor on stage and screen since the 1930s, but gained his highest profile roles after "Quatermass II"; he went on to win the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> as Sheikh Ilderim in "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>" (1959). He also appeared in "<a href="Lucky%20Jim">Lucky Jim</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Oliver%21%20%28film%29">Oliver!</a>" (1968).

Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she was chosen by BBC management rather than the production team, as she was the wife of the BBC's head of <a href="radio%20drama">radio drama</a>, <a href="Val%20Gielgud">Val Gielgud</a>. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey learned his lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by <a href="John%20Stone%20%28actor%29">John Stone</a>; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film "<a href="X%20the%20Unknown">X the Unknown</a>", which <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> had intended as a sequel to <a href="The%20Quatermass%20Xperiment">their version of</a> "The Quatermass Experiment", until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.

Four actors who each became well known for a particular role on British television had supporting parts in "Quatermass II". <a href="Rupert%20Davies">Rupert Davies</a> who played MP Vincent Broadhead would go on to find fame as Sûreté detective Commissaire Jules <a href="Maigret">Maigret</a>, the title character of 1960s TV series "<a href="Maigret%20%281960%20TV%20series%29">Maigret</a>", based on <a href="Georges%20Simenon">Georges Simenon</a>'s novels. <a href="Roger%20Delgado">Roger Delgado</a>, who found fame in the 1970s as <a href="Master%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">the Master</a> in "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" (1971–73), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to "the mark" in episode four. <a href="Wilfrid%20Brambell">Wilfrid Brambell</a>, later star of the <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="Steptoe%20and%20Son">Steptoe and Son</a>" (1962–74) and <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' film "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28film%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>" (1964), appeared as a <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">tramp</a>, and <a href="Melvyn%20Hayes">Melvyn Hayes</a>, who played the small role of Frankie, became one of the stars of the popular sitcom "<a href="It%20Ain%27t%20Half%20Hot%20Mum">It Ain't Half Hot Mum</a>" (1974–81).

Nigel Kneale not only wrote the serial but, previously an actor, had two speaking parts. He played the voice heard over the factory <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a> system in episode five, and <a href="narrator">narrated</a> the <a href="%3Awikt%3Arecapitulation">recaps</a> at the beginning of episodes two, three, four and six. Kneale went on to write <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a> screenplays such as "<a href="Look%20Back%20in%20Anger%20%281959%20film%29">Look Back in Anger</a>" (1958) and "<a href="The%20First%20Men%20in%20the%20Moon">The First Men in the Moon</a>" (1964), as well as continuing to write for television, including two further "Quatermass" serials, until 1997.

Kneale credited the director Rudolph Cartier with bringing to the screen in "Quatermass II", with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style that had not been seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third "Quatermass" serial, "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>", in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as "<a href="Anna%20Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>" (1961), "Cross of Iron" (1961) and "Lee Oswald — Assassin" (1966). He continued directing for television until the 1970s.

The available British television audience had doubled since "The Quatermass Experiment" had been shown in 1953, and the viewing figures for "Quatermass II" were accordingly higher. The serial gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, rising to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluding with 9 million. A BBC audience research report commissioned after "Quatermass II" had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.

"Quatermass II" received positive newspaper reviews in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" and the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", although the BBC's "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" <a href="listings%20magazine">listings magazine</a> published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a>, who felt it to be not as good as the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in <a href="Haverfordwest">Haverfordwest</a> who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland to spend the rest of her life in a <a href="convent">convent</a>; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.

The BBC's own website regarded "Quatermass II" unfavourably when reviewing its <a href="DVD">DVD</a> release in 2005. "The script is too often let down by the production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray [sic] — less an actress than a <a href="finishing%20school">finishing school</a> on legs." Writing in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial. "Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in "Quatermass II", the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They’re coming in their thousands,' he says, 'this is it.'" However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens' food supply system. In any case, it is in direct contrast with Kneale's deliberate attack on racial intolerance in "Quatermass and the Pit".

Speaking in a 2003 <a href="television%20documentary">television documentary</a> about Nigel Kneale's career, the writer and critic <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> praised the underlying themes of "Quatermass II", and their particular relevance to the British way of life. ""Quatermass II" is the British "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers", but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What "Quatermass II" does is take that metaphor and apply it to the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the council</a>, or in this case big business." The British Film Institute's "<a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>" website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial."With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. <a href="communist">communist</a>) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age — the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> tests). In short, "Quatermass II" was the perfect cold-war drama."

Some <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science-fiction fans</a> have speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and "Quatermass II" in particular — with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for "The X-Files" during the 1990s, but declined the offer.

Other genre productions that have been compared with the serial include the 1970 "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" story "<a href="Spearhead%20from%20Space">Spearhead from Space</a>". This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a meteorite shower; a factory taken over for the growth of the alien creature, and governmental institutions being infiltrated by servants of the aliens.

As with "The Quatermass Experiment", the film rights to the serial were purchased by <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> — in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the serial was even made. Titled "<a href="Quatermass%202">Quatermass 2</a>", the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by <a href="Val%20Guest">Val Guest</a>, with <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a> starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title "Enemy from Space".

Shortly after "Quatermass II" finished its run, comedian <a href="Bob%20Monkhouse">Bob Monkhouse</a> included a spoof of the serial in an episode of his own BBC television series, which featured Monica Grey reprising her role as Paula Quatermass. Cartier and Kneale were greatly displeased with this, and complained to their superiors at the BBC about it.

Quatermass returned to the BBC in 1958 when Kneale's third serial, "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>", began transmission. That was the last television appearance of the character for 20 years, until Kneale brought Quatermass back for a final time in the 1979 serial "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%29">Quatermass</a>", this time produced for <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>.

A serialised <a href="novelisation">novelisation</a> of "Quatermass II", written by Kneale, ran in the "Daily Express" newspaper in the UK from 5 December to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project. The television scripts were released by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, to coincide with the transmission of the Thames Television serial.

In April 2005 <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> released a DVD <a href="box%20set">box set</a> of all its existing "Quatermass" material. This included <a href="Remaster">digitally restored</a> versions of all six episodes of "Quatermass II", with the sound and vision of the telerecording copies cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.

In 2016 <a href="https%3A//store.bbc.com/quatermass-ii">BBC Store</a> released "Quatermass II" and "Quatermass and the Pit".

Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel

The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT), also referred to as the Metro Bus Tunnel, is a pair of <a href="public%20transit">public transit</a> <a href="tunnel">tunnel</a>s in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, United States. The tunnel serves <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a>, running west under Pine Street from 9th Avenue to 3rd Avenue, and south under 3rd Avenue to South Jackson Street. It was used only by <a href="Transit%20bus">buses</a> from its opening in 1990 until 2005, and since 2009 it has been shared by buses and <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a>. The <a href="double%20track">double-track</a> tunnel and its four stations constitute parts of the <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a> light rail line, which continues north to the <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20station">University of Washington station</a> and south through the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a> to <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a> as part of <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>'s <a href="Link%20light%20rail">Link light rail</a> network. The stations are also served by <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> and <a href="Sound%20Transit%20Express">Sound Transit Express</a> buses that leave the tunnel north via <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a>, south via the <a href="SODO%20Busway">SODO Busway</a>, or east via <a href="Interstate%2090%20in%20Washington">Interstate 90</a>. The DSTT is the busiest section of the Link light rail network, with an average of over 10,000 weekday <a href="Boarding%20%28transport%29">boardings</a>. It is owned by King County Metro and shared with Sound Transit through a joint-operating agreement signed in 2002. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is one of two tunnels in the United States shared by buses and trains, the other being the <a href="Mount%20Washington%20Transit%20Tunnel">Mount Washington Transit Tunnel</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, and is the only one in the United States with shared stations.

Though proposals for a <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> tunnel under 3rd Avenue were introduced in the 1910s and 1920s, planning for the modern bus and rail Metro Bus Tunnel only began in 1974. The King County Metro Council approved the bus tunnel proposal in November 1983, but construction did not begin until March 1987. The tunnel between <a href="Convention%20Place%20station">Convention Place</a> and <a href="Westlake%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">Westlake</a> stations was built using the <a href="cut-and-cover">cut-and-cover</a> method, closing Pine Street for 19 months and disrupting nearby retail businesses. The segment from Westlake to the <a href="International%20District/Chinatown%20station">International District</a> was bored with two <a href="tunnel-boring%20machine">tunnel-boring machine</a>s, heading north from <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Seattle%29">Union Station</a> and finishing within a month of each other. Tests of normal buses and the <a href="Breda%20Costruzioni%20Ferroviarie">Breda</a> <a href="dual-mode%20bus">dual-mode bus</a>es built specifically for tunnel routes began in March 1989; tunnel construction was declared complete in June 1990, at a cost of $469 million. Light rail tracks were installed in anticipation of future rapid transit service through the tunnel, which was later found to be poorly insulated and unusable for Link light rail. <a href="Soft%20opening">Soft opening</a>s and public previews of the five tunnel stations were held from August 1989 to September 1990, with regular bus service beginning on September 15, carrying 28,000 daily passengers in its first year of operation. For the next several years, until June 2004, service in the tunnel was provided exclusively by dual-mode buses, which ran as <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es in the tunnellike the city's <a href="Trolleybuses%20in%20Seattle">extensive trolleybus system</a>and as diesel buses on surface streets and freeways.

The tunnel was closed on September 24, 2005, for modification to accommodate both buses and Sound Transit's Central Link light rail trains with shared lanes and platforms. The roadway was lowered by and other improvements were made to prepare for light rail service. New <a href="hybrid%20electric%20bus">hybrid electric bus</a>es were moved into the tunnel to replace the Breda fleet, as the <a href="overhead%20wire">overhead wire</a> was replaced for light rail trains. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, and light rail service began on July 18, 2009. A stub tunnel, branching from the main tunnel, was constructed under Pine Street to allow light rail trains to stop and reverse direction; it was later used as the first segment of a <a href="University%20Link">light rail extension</a> to <a href="Capitol%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Capitol Hill</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> that opened in 2016. Convention Place station was closed permanently on July 21, 2018, to make way for an expansion of the <a href="Washington%20State%20Convention%20Center">Washington State Convention Center</a>. Plans call for the downtown transit tunnel to lose its bus service on March 23, 2019; from that point on, the tunnel will be used only by light rail trains.

The , twin tunnels serve the <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a> light rail line, which uses the tunnel between <a href="Westlake%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">Westlake</a> and <a href="International%20District/Chinatown%20station">International District/Chinatown</a> stations, and seven bus routes for <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> and <a href="Sound%20Transit%20Express">Sound Transit Express</a>, which run between the Convention Place portal and International District/Chinatown station. Entrances at the three middle stations are built into nearby buildings with <a href="variable-message%20sign">variable-message sign</a>s over the stairs and elevators leading to the <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a>s. A total of 11 <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>-<a href="Accessibility">accessible</a> elevators connect the tunnel stations to the surface. As part of the city's <a href="public%20art">public art</a> program that began in 1973, the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and its stations were furnished with $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in artwork by 25 artists commissioned by King County Metro. All tunnel stations are below street level and consist of two <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a>s, two pickup lanes, and a passing lane in the middle.

The northern portal, accessible to buses at street level from Olive Way, and from <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> via an <a href="express%20lane">express lane</a> ramp, is the former <a href="Convention%20Place%20station">Convention Place station</a> at the intersection of 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the <a href="Washington%20State%20Convention%20Center">Washington State Convention Center</a>. Until its closure in 2018, Convention Place was the only bus-exclusive station in the tunnel, and consisted of four sheltered platforms in a sunken, open-air <a href="layover">layover</a> space below street level. Buses enter the tunnel from 9th Avenue and pass under the historic <a href="Camlin%20Hotel">Camlin Hotel</a>, before joining the <a href="University%20Link%20Tunnel">University Link Tunnel</a> used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under Pine Street to <a href="Capitol%20Hill%20station">Capitol Hill station</a>.

The DSTT enters Westlake station under Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues, located between the <a href="Westlake%20Center">Westlake Center</a> shopping mall and <a href="Westlake%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">Westlake Park</a>. The station features a two-block-long mezzanine with exits to Pine Street and several retailers, including the Westlake Center, <a href="Macy%27s">Macy's</a> in the former <a href="The%20Bon%20March%C3%A9">The Bon Marché</a> flagship store, and the headquarters of <a href="Nordstrom">Nordstrom</a>, as well as the King County Metro <a href="customer%20service">customer service</a> center. The area around the station is known as the Westlake Hub, with connections to the <a href="South%20Lake%20Union%20Streetcar">South Lake Union Streetcar</a> and the <a href="Seattle%20Center%20Monorail">Seattle Center Monorail</a> as well as the King County Metro and Sound Transit buses. Leaving Westlake Station, the tunnel turns south under Century Square to follow 3rd Avenue and its <a href="transit%20mall">transit mall</a> through the <a href="central%20business%20district">central business district</a>, parallel to the shoreline of <a href="Elliott%20Bay">Elliott Bay</a>.

Three blocks south of Pine Street, buses and trains enter <a href="University%20Street%20station">University Street station</a>, located between Union and Seneca streets adjacent to <a href="Benaroya%20Hall">Benaroya Hall</a> and <a href="1201%20Third%20Avenue">1201 Third Avenue</a> in the financial district. The station has a split mezzanine, with entrances to 2nd Avenue and University Street accessible from the north half, and an entrance to Seneca Street from the south half. From University Street, the tunnel continues under 3rd Avenue for five blocks, entering the <a href="Pioneer%20Square%2C%20Seattle">Pioneer Square</a> neighborhood and <a href="Historic%20districts%20in%20the%20United%20States">historic district</a>. At this point, 3rd Avenue passes several of Seattle's skyscrapers, including the historic <a href="Seattle%20Tower">Seattle Tower</a>, <a href="Safeco%20Plaza%20%28Seattle%29">Safeco Plaza</a>, the <a href="Fourth%20and%20Madison%20Building">Fourth and Madison Building</a> and the <a href="Wells%20Fargo%20Center%20%28Seattle%29">Wells Fargo Center</a>. Within University Street station, the tunnel passes over the century-old <a href="Great%20Northern%20Tunnel">Great Northern Tunnel</a> with a clearance of .

<a href="Pioneer%20Square%20station">Pioneer Square station</a> is located between Cherry Street and Yesler Way, with four entrances to nearby streets and Prefontaine Place serving two mezzanines. The station serves the <a href="administrative%20center">administrative center</a>s of the Seattle and King County governments, located within walking distance of <a href="Seattle%20City%20Hall">Seattle City Hall</a>, the <a href="Seattle%20Municipal%20Tower">Seattle Municipal Tower</a>, the <a href="King%20County%20Courthouse">King County Courthouse</a> and the <a href="King%20County%20Administration%20Building">King County Administration Building</a>, as well as other major buildings, including <a href="Smith%20Tower">Smith Tower</a>, <a href="Columbia%20Center">Columbia Center</a> and the <a href="Alaska%20Building">Alaska Building</a>. From Pioneer Square, the tunnel travels down a 5.5% <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> to cross under the Great Northern Tunnel at a 45-degree angle near the intersection of 4th Avenue South and South Washington Street, briefly descending below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, before turning <a href="Cardinal%20direction">cardinal south</a> into the <a href="International%20District%2C%20Seattle">International District</a> neighborhood.

International District/Chinatown station, the southernmost tunnel station, is partially open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Seattle%29">Union Station</a>. The station has connections to <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> and <a href="Sounder%20commuter%20rail">Sounder commuter rail</a> at <a href="King%20Street%20Station%20%28Seattle%29">King Street Station</a> a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, as well as the <a href="First%20Hill%20Streetcar">First Hill Streetcar</a> on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a> to the west and <a href="Uwajimaya">Uwajimaya</a> a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks, and bus lanes are separated by <a href="railway%20signal">railway signal</a>s at an underground bus layover and <a href="staging%20area">staging area</a> next to the tunnel <a href="Rest%20area">comfort room</a> for bus drivers. The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the former <a href="Interstate%2090%20in%20Washington">Interstate 90</a> <a href="express%20lane">express lane</a>s for <a href="High-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">high-occupancy vehicles</a>. Light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the <a href="SODO%20Busway">SODO Busway</a>, while eastbound buses use a set of ramps that travel onto Interstate 90. Eastbound buses formerly used a ramp that merges with the Interstate 90 express lanes that closed in September 2018 and will be retrofitted for the <a href="East%20Link%20Extension%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">East Link</a> light rail service that begins in 2023.

The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is part of the "Third Avenue Transit Spine", the busiest transit corridor in Seattle, serving a combined average of 54,000 weekday riders with bus stops on the surface. The tunnel has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour per direction with a minimum of 90-second <a href="headway">headway</a>s, carrying 22,000 <a href="passengers%20per%20hour%20per%20direction">passengers per hour per direction</a>, but is only able to carry 12,000 per hour per direction in 4-car light rail vehicles with current systems in place. Prior to the start of Link light rail service, the DSTT could serve up to 145 buses during the afternoon <a href="rush%20hour">rush hour</a>. , the DSTT carries 52,600 daily riders, of which 10,000 are on light rail.
The tunnel carries a segment of the Central Link light rail line, which runs from the <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20station">University of Washington station</a> through <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a> and the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a> to <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a>. Trains serve all downtown tunnel stations 20 hours a day every day; during regular weekday service, trains run roughly every six to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of 15 minutes in the early morning and 20 minutes at night. During weekends, Central Link trains arrive every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings. Light rail service from Westlake to International District/Chinatown takes approximately seven minutes.

, the DSTT is served by seven bus routes, stopping at all four tunnel stations as well as stops near the former <a href="Convention%20Place%20station">Convention Place station</a>. At each station, bus routes are divided into three bays labeled with their general direction. Bay A is served by three routes heading north toward <a href="Northgate%2C%20Seattle">Northgate</a> and the <a href="University%20District%2C%20Seattle">University District</a> and east to <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland</a> via <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20520">State Route 520</a>; Bay C is served by three routes heading south through the SODO Busway toward the Rainier Valley and <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton</a>; and Bay D is served by a single route, Sound Transit Express route 550, heading east to <a href="Mercer%20Island%2C%20Washington">Mercer Island</a> and <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a> via Interstate 90. Since June 2012, inbound buses have been allowed to drop off and pick up passengers at the front end of the platform, enabled after the elimination of the <a href="Ride%20Free%20Area">Ride Free Area</a> to speed up boarding times.

During closures of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, tunnel buses are rerouted onto 2nd and 4th Avenues between Yesler Way and Pine Street, and Stewart Street and Olive Way between 2nd and Boren Avenues. Metro also runs a <a href="Shuttle%20bus%20service">special route</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20King%20County%20Metro%20bus%20routes%23Route%2097">Route 97 Link Shuttle</a>, between all Link light rail stations during service disruptions.

The DSTT is open for 20 hours on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am the following day, and for 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00 am to midnight. At the time of its opening in 1990, the Metro Bus Tunnel only operated from 5:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays and 10:00 am to 6:00 pm on Saturdays, with no Sunday service; the operating hours were temporarily extended into weekday nights from 1998 to 2000 at the request of the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>, but were cut after the passage of <a href="List%20of%20Washington%20initiatives%20to%20the%20people%231999">Initiative 695</a> and subsequent loss of motor vehicle <a href="excise%20tax">excise tax</a> revenue. Preparations for Link light rail service restored late-night and full weekend hours for the tunnel, introduced in June 2009 after Sound Transit Express route 550 moved all of its trips into the tunnel.

Coordination between buses and trains in the tunnel is managed by the Link Light Rail Operations Control Center (OCC), located at the King County Metro Communication and Control Center in <a href="SoDo%2C%20Seattle">SoDo</a>. The OCC controls vehicle separation between buses and trains by using on-board <a href="radio-frequency%20identification">radio-frequency identification</a> tags installed on tunnel buses and light rail vehicles, their locations tracked by passing over <a href="induction%20loop">induction loop</a>s embedded in the tunnel roadway. Signals at each station indicate when a driver can proceed through the tunnel. Within the DSTT, bus <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a>s are set at in stations and staging areas and between stations. Light rail trains and buses are required to wait in the tunnels between stations until the platform is cleared of vehicles ahead; buses are mandated to keep a minimum of six seconds of separation between each other.

King County Metro and Sound Transit, the joint operators of the tunnel, use two types of vehicles in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel: <a href="Kinkisharyo-Mitsui">Kinkisharyo-Mitsui</a> light rail vehicles and <a href="New%20Flyer">New Flyer</a> <a href="Diesel-electric%20transmission">diesel-electric</a> <a href="hybrid%20electric%20bus">hybrid buses</a>. The buses, dubbed "tunnel buses" by King County Metro, were ordered in 2004 to replace a fleet of <a href="Breda%20Costruzioni%20Ferroviarie">Breda</a> <a href="dual-mode%20bus">dual-mode</a> electric <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es whose <a href="overhead%20wire">overhead wire</a> was to be removed in the tunnel's renovation for light rail; 59 of the dual-mode Breda coaches were converted into fully electric trolleybuses between 2004 and 2007 and moved to surface routes, where they continued to operate for more than a decade before being fully replaced in 2016. The New Flyer <a href="low-floor%20bus">low-floor</a>, <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated bus</a>es feature a "hush mode" that allows buses to operate solely on stored electric power within the tunnel, minimizing emissions and noise.

Several proposals for a <a href="Cut-and-cover">cut-and-cover subway tunnel</a> under 3rd Avenue in Downtown Seattle were presented to the City of Seattle by predecessors of the <a href="Seattle%20Planning%20Commission">Seattle Planning Commission</a> throughout the 20th century. The first major proposal was part of urban planner <a href="Virgil%20Bogue">Virgil Bogue</a>'s "Plan for Seattle" in 1911, as Route 1 of a proposed <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> network. Route 1 ran southeast on 3rd Avenue from a <a href="Orbital%20%28metro%29">circular ring</a> around a proposed <a href="civic%20center">civic center</a> in the <a href="Denny%20Regrade%2C%20Seattle">Denny Regrade</a> neighborhood to <a href="King%20Street%20Station%20%28Seattle%29">King Street Station</a>, paralleled to the west by a subway on 1st Avenue known as Route 17; stations on the line were to have additional entrances from <a href="department%20store">department store</a>s and other major businesses on 3rd Avenue. The plan was supported by City Engineer <a href="Reginald%20H.%20Thomson">Reginald H. Thomson</a> and the Municipal League among others, but opposed by businesses fearing it would shift the commercial district further north, and by the three daily newspapers published in Seattle. A special <a href="municipal%20election">municipal election</a> for the <a href="comprehensive%20plan">comprehensive plan</a> was held on March 5, 1912, in which Seattle voters rejected it by a 10,000-vote margin.

Although Bogue's proposal was ultimately rejected, some elements of the plan were independently studied by others, including a rapid transit subway in Downtown Seattle. In 1920, City Engineer Arthur H. Dimmock published a report recommending a rapid transit system for the city of Seattle, centered around a cut-and-cover subway tunnel under 3rd Avenue from Virginia Street to Yesler Way. The line was to connect to surface and elevated lines at Dexter Avenue, Olive Way and South Jackson Street, serving the neighborhoods of <a href="Fremont%2C%20Seattle">Fremont</a>, <a href="Eastlake%2C%20Seattle">Eastlake</a>, <a href="Capitol%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Capitol Hill</a>, and <a href="North%20Delridge%2C%20Seattle%2C%20Washington">North Delridge</a> in <a href="West%20Seattle%2C%20Seattle">West Seattle</a>. The proposal, which was expected not to be acted upon for at least 15 years, gained little support, and was called a project of "purely academic interest" by Mayor <a href="Hugh%20M.%20Caldwell">Hugh M. Caldwell</a>, who doubted that any rapid transit proposal would be seriously considered during his term. The Seattle City Planning Commission proposed its own rapid transit system in 1926, centered on an elevated line over Western Avenue with a possible parallel subway under 3rd Avenue from Yesler Way to Pike Street. The Seattle Traffic Research Commission published a report in 1928 recommending a subway under 2nd Avenue from <a href="King%20Street%20Station">King Street Station</a> to Pike Street as part of a longer rapid transit line serving the <a href="University%20District%2C%20Seattle">University District</a> and Fremont. In the late 1950s, the Seattle Transit Commission proposed building a rapid transit system on the existing <a href="right-of-way">right-of-way</a> used by <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> between <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, Seattle and Everett, with a two-station subway under 5th Avenue in Downtown Seattle.

The most significant rapid transit proposal came as part of the <a href="Forward%20Thrust">Forward Thrust</a> initiatives of the late 1960s, which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue. The subway would be fed by lines from <a href="Ballard%2C%20Seattle">Ballard</a>, <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Seattle">Lake City</a>, the University District, Capitol Hill, <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, and <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton</a>, combining for a planned minimum headway of minutes at rush hour, minutes during midday, and five minutes at all other times. The stations on 3rd Avenue were to be situated at South Jackson Street and 5th Avenue South, James and Cherry streets, Seneca and Spring streets, and Pike and Pine streets, all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the <a href="Municipality%20of%20Metropolitan%20Seattle">Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle</a>. Seattle voters were asked to provide $385 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), to supplement a $765 million grant (equivalent to $ in dollars) from the <a href="Urban%20Mass%20Transportation%20Administration">Urban Mass Transportation Administration</a> (UMTA), during a municipal election on February 13, 1968, narrowly passing the <a href="Municipal%20bond">bond</a> by 50.8%, but falling short of the required 60 percent <a href="supermajority">supermajority</a>. A second attempt on May 19, 1970, with an adjusted $440 million local contribution (equivalent to $ in dollars) and $881 million federal grant (equivalent to $ in dollars), failed to pass with only 46% approval amid a local <a href="Recession%20of%201969%E2%80%9370">recession</a> caused by layoffs at <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>; the <a href="earmark%20%28politics%29">earmarked</a> funds intended for the Forward Thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, to build its <a href="MARTA">rapid transit system</a>.

The concept of a downtown bus tunnel was first proposed in 1974 during discussions between <a href="Governor%20of%20Washington">Governor</a> <a href="Daniel%20J.%20Evans">Dan Evans</a> and <a href="Mayor%20of%20Seattle">Seattle Mayor</a> <a href="Wesley%20C.%20Uhlman">Wes Uhlman</a> about regional transportation projects in response to the proposed extension of Interstate 90 into Seattle via a <a href="Homer%20M.%20Hadley%20Memorial%20Bridge">third floating bridge</a> crossing <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>. <a href="Municipality%20of%20Metropolitan%20Seattle">Metro Transit</a> later commissioned a study into the bus tunnel, released the following July, which determined that it would not be able to adequately meet the rush hour demand of downtown bus ridership by 1980. The study suggested that a double-decked tunnel with <a href="automated%20guideway%20transit">automated guideway transit</a> to complement bus service, running from Union Station to the <a href="Seattle%20Center">Seattle Center</a>, would be able to meet projected demand at an estimated cost of $450 million. Ultimately, the plan was rejected because of the high cost of ventilation for diesel buses that would use the tunnel. The bus tunnel proposal resurfaced in 1979, outlining a tunnel from South Jackson Street to Pine Street that would carry 200 buses an hour in each direction at a cost of up to $350 million with the option of conversion for electric rail transit in the future. The tunnel was suggested by Metro officials and engineering consultants <a href="Parsons%20Brinckerhoff">Parsons Brinckerhoff</a> as a solution to worsening downtown traffic, and was better received than alternative concepts. The proposal gained further support from Metro Transit in its long-term "Metro 1990" plan, adopted in 1981, as a transit mall or tunnel under 3rd Avenue carrying buses that could be converted for a light rail system. The <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Council%20of%20Governments">Puget Sound Council of Governments</a> (PSCOG), a regional planning agency, endorsed Metro Transit's proposal and integrated the tunnel into its proposed light rail line connecting Seattle to <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish County</a>.

The Metro Transit Committee debated the inclusion of the bus tunnel in the project's <a href="environmental%20impact%20assessment">environmental impact assessment</a> well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the <a href="Seattle%20City%20Council">Seattle City Council</a> and Mayor <a href="Charles%20Royer">Charles Royer</a> preferred the transit mall, but stated that a tunnel would be a long-term solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson's proposed dual-mode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped transit mall.

Metro unveiled its preliminary plans for the bus tunnel in January 1984, selecting five sites for stations along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street: at Union Station, the King County Courthouse, between Seneca and Union streets, at the Westlake Mall, and near the Washington State Convention Center. The <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a> opposed Metro's preference for the tunnel to cross the existing <a href="Great%20Northern%20Tunnel">Great Northern Tunnel</a> by going under it, the agency stating that passing over would require a <a href="cut-and-cover%20tunnel">cut-and-cover tunnel</a> that would disrupt <a href="City%20Hall%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">City Hall Park</a>. The following month, Metro announced that it would use a fleet of 200 dual-mode buses for the first decade of tunnel operations, with an eventual switch to subway trains. The <a href="bored%20tunnel">bored tunnel</a> would be able to carry 180 buses an hour in each direction, serving either a wide <a href="island%20platform">island platform</a> or two smaller <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a>s that would be dug out from the surface. In April, Metro published the draft <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> for the tunnel project, estimating a cost of $387 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) and a completion date of June 1989. The cost of the project drew criticism at <a href="public%20hearing">public hearing</a>s for using a significant portion of Metro's capital budget, a total of $840 million from sales tax revenue approved by voters in 1980, as well as potential disruption to business during the cut-and-cover construction of the stations and Pine Street segment of the tunnel.

UMTA ranked Metro's bus tunnel project as first among transit projects favored to receive federal funding in 1985, despite its reliance on unproven dual-mode buses. Metro tested a prototype <a href="Renault">Renault</a> PER 180 dual-mode trolleybus in 1983, describing it as problematic after finding it exceeded freeway <a href="axle%20load">axle load</a> limits by and having to replace several parts after several mechanical failures. <a href="98th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> later appropriated $20 million to the City of Seattle for the bus tunnel project in October 1984, allowing for right-of-way acquisition to begin, but the funds were withheld until restrictions on new transit projects were lifted by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> the following May.

The Downtown Transit Project subcommittee unanimously approved Metro recommendations that would reduce the number of bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for <a href="tunnel%20boring%20machine">tunnel boring machine</a>s for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the <a href="Westlake%20Mall">Westlake Mall</a> and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.

In March 1986, the federal government offered Metro a contract committing $195 million in UMTA funding toward the bus tunnel, requiring that a decision on whether to move forward with the project be made by December 31. A month later, the <a href="King%20County%20Council">King County Council</a> asked Metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to cover half of the $395 million cost of the project; the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street in preparation for tunnel construction. On May 15, the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan administration</a> signed a contract with Metro to commit $197 million of the $395 million required for the bus tunnel project, assuming re-authorization of a mass transit grant program by Congress, while also extending the deadline for a final decision to September 1987. Hours later, the Metro Council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation, with construction set to begin in July. The Metro Council accepted the UMTA contract during their June 5 meeting, allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin. The tunnel construction contract was awarded to the <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> of Guy F. Atkinson Construction and <a href="Dillingham%20Construction">Dillingham Construction</a> in late September for $44.16 million, beating seven competing bids with an estimate far lower than the approximately $61 million predicted by Metro engineers. The contract for the dual-mode trolleybuses was awarded by the Metro Council to <a href="Breda%20Costruzioni%20Ferroviarie">Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie</a> in October, consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of $133 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars); it was approved by UMTA in November.

Construction on the bus tunnel project began with partial closures of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its <a href="Trolleybuses%20in%20Seattle">electric trolleybus routes</a> onto 1st Avenue.

Excavation of the 3rd Avenue tunnel segment began with the ceremonial launch of the "Mighty Mole", a , <a href="tunnel%20boring%20machine">tunnel boring machine</a> (TBM), on March 6, 1987. The TBM, designed by Robbins Company of <a href="Kent%2C%20Washington">Kent, Washington</a>, and built by Nicholson Manufacturing in Seattle, began digging the western tunnel from Union Station the following May. A second, identical "Mighty Mole" TBM began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on June 29. During tunnel boring under 3rd Avenue between Spring Street and <a href="Madison%20Street%20%28Seattle%29">Madison Street</a> on October 21, a small <a href="earthflow">earthflow</a> damaged a <a href="water%20main">water main</a> and caused pavement on 3rd Avenue to drop , shutting down water in the nearby <a href="Seattle%20City%20Light">Seattle City Light</a> and <a href="1001%20Fourth%20Avenue%20Plaza">1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza</a> buildings. While repairing the broken water main, electricians working on damaged <a href="high-voltage%20cable">high-voltage cable</a>s caused a small <a href="power%20outage">power outage</a> that affected eight downtown buildings on the night of October 28, but were able to restore power by the following morning. Work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in November, when the TBM hit an unexpectedly large pocket of loose sand under Madison Street that had to be stabilized with <a href="grout">grout</a> to prevent damage to the adjacent Seattle City Light building. Boring on both tunnels was stopped in early January 1988, when a pocket of wet sand was encountered before the planned 90-degree turn onto Pine Street. Metro and tunnel contractors <a href="Guy%20F.%20Atkinson%20Construction">Atkinson</a>/Dillingham, who had scheduled tunnel excavation for completion in mid-January, closed 3rd Avenue between Pike and Pine streets and installed 40 <a href="water%20well">drilled wells</a> to remove water from the sand pocket in February. Digging resumed on the western tunnel on March 14, and the TBM reached Westlake station on April 9, completing the first of the two tunnels. The eastern tunnel was completed a month later on May 18, allowing for parts of the TBMs to be salvaged and the steel outer shells to be buried in the tunnel.

The Pine Street segment of the tunnel was planned to be dug cut-and-cover from the surface. In preparation for utility relocation work on Pine Street, Metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east–west streets in February 1987. On April 27, excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of Pine Street, and its offramp to Interstate 5, to automobile traffic between 3rd Avenue and Boren Avenue. Workers finished digging in late August, allowing the project to progress to concrete pouring for the roadway. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the <a href="Christmas%20shopping">Christmas shopping season</a> beginning November 1 at the request of downtown merchants, with a temporary surface laid over <a href="backfill">backfill</a> for automobiles and pedestrians. On January 4, the street was closed to automobile traffic once again, along with the intersection of 5th Avenue and Pine Street and the Pike Street offramp of I-5, to install utility lines and a permanent roadway. Pine Street was fully reopened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the completion of <a href="Westlake%20Park%20%28Seattle%29">Westlake Park</a> and the Westlake Center shopping mall, a year ahead of schedule.

By October 1988, Metro reported that 53% of major construction was complete and anticipated that the tunnel would be completed in May 1990 and opened for service in September 1990. Seattle Mayor <a href="Norm%20Rice">Norm Rice</a> and City Council members <a href="Paul%20Kraabel">Paul Kraabel</a> and George Benson recommended a limited opening of the tunnel for the <a href="1990%20Goodwill%20Games">1990 Goodwill Games</a> to be held in July, but Metro rejected the proposal so that the safety systems of the tunnel could be tested adequately before service began. Testing in the bus tunnel began with a ceremonial first run on March 15, 1989, first with a diesel bus and then one of the Breda dual-mode trolleybuses operating in diesel mode, as the overhead trolley wires had not yet been installed. Wooden planks and steel plates covered slots in the concrete roadway where rails would be installed later. Local media were given a tour the next day. By January 1990, the tunnel stations were declared "nearly complete", with only minor work still left for contractors. Murals and other interactive art installations were placed in the nearly complete stations from December 1989 onward, as part of a $1.5 million arts program. Tunnel construction was finished on June 7, 1990, leaving Metro to test safety systems and train personnel for regular service to begin in September.

The initial cost of the tunnel project was estimated in 1984 to be $334.6 million, but the final costs rose 56% over budget to a total of $468.7 million (equivalent to $ in dollars); the project's cost overruns were blamed on unanticipated soil conditions on the approach to Pine Street from 3rd Avenue, complaints and payouts to downtown businesses disrupted by tunnel construction, and the death of an electrician during construction. Excavated dirt from the project was used as fill for runway expansion at <a href="Paine%20Field">Paine Field</a> in nearby <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>.

A minor scandal involving the bus tunnel project emerged in late 1988, over the discovery that granite to be used by Metro in the tunnel's stations had been sourced from <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. The Verde Fontaine granite was quarried in South Africa, which had been under <a href="Apartheid">Apartheid rule</a> at the time, but was cut and finished in Italy, allowing for it to be approved despite the Metro Council's ongoing <a href="Disinvestment%20from%20South%20Africa">boycott of South African goods</a>. The Verde Fontaine granite was selected for use as benches and interior walls in Westlake and Pioneer Square stations by architecture firm TRA; Metro was unaware that Verde Fontaine was only quarried in South Africa. The granite's origin was discovered by an activist from the Black Contractors Coalition in late 1988, who notified Metro and members of the Metro Council. Metro determined that replacing the of granite would cost $500,000 and delay both stations but would not delay the planned 1990 opening and would be covered by contingency funds in the project's budget.

During a press conference on January 25, 1989, Metro Director Alan Gibbs confirmed that the granite had been quarried in South Africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the Metro Council Transit Committee the following week. The announcement was met with calls from King County Councilman <a href="Ron%20Sims">Ron Sims</a> to fire the responsible Metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase. Metro's ban on South African goods was stricter than the federal sanctions, which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, and was used by UMTA to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project.

A report by the Metro Council Rules Committee delivered in March stated that the granite's origin was discovered in early 1988, and was authorized by tunnel superintendent David Kalberer with the assumption that only a small amount would be used to furnish <a href="University%20Street%20station">University Street station</a>. Kalberer, who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal, admitted that the failure to consult the Metro Council's tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake. Metro Director Alan Gibbs resigned on February 23 as a result of the scandal and was succeeded by technical director Richard Sandaas in September. The granite was rejected by Metro and was returned to the supplier in Italy.

Before this discovery, in September 1987, African-American rights groups had forced tunnel contractor Atkinson/Dillingham to return 36 steel beams from South Africa used for temporary <a href="shoring">shoring</a> at <a href="Pioneer%20Square%20station">Pioneer Square station</a>. This led Metro Director Alan Gibbs to propose a ban on South African materials by Metro for its projects, which was adopted by a resolution of the Metro Council on September 17.

Regular service in the bus tunnel began on September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton. The limited service was the result of delays in the manufacturing of dual-mode buses from Breda, which were fully delivered in 1991. The opening was preceded by <a href="soft%20opening">soft opening</a>s of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service. A ceremonial <a href="walkathon">walk and run</a> was held on September 9, 1990, and attracted 5,000 participants.

In its first year of operations, the bus tunnel carried 28,000 daily passengers on 688 scheduled bus trips. The tunnel reduced the number of buses operated on 3rd Avenue at peak hours from 190 to 86, with 20 Metro routes using the tunnel. "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" called it a "qualified success", commenting that the tunnel was like a "mini-subway system". The paper's editorial board also requested that Metro expand tunnel hours to keep buses running for late-night workers and entertainment events held on weekends. On December 9, 1991, the <a href="SODO%20Busway">SODO Busway</a> opened, extending bus service from the tunnel into SODO and moving southbound routes off Interstate 5. Direct access from <a href="Interstate%2090%20%28Washington%29">Interstate 90</a> to the bus tunnel was opened in February 1992 as part of a reversible express lane system for the <a href="Homer%20M.%20Hadley%20Memorial%20Bridge">new floating bridge</a>.

The first use of the tunnel by Sound Transit buses began on September 18, 1999, with the takeover of Metro's Seattle–Bellevue express route, which was renumbered from 226 to 550. To operate buses in the tunnel, Sound Transit leased 20 dual-mode buses from Metro, repainted them in the agency's colors, and contracted with Metro to operate the route along with other Sound Transit Express routes in King County.

From the outset, the bus tunnel was intended to be converted for <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> trains at some point in the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during tunnel construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's <a href="Insulator%20%28electricity%29">electrical insulation</a>, which would later render them unusable for rail service.

A regional transit authority was formed in the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9 billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel would need to be replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new <a href="hybrid%20electric%20bus">hybrid electric bus</a>es to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.

Sound Transit approved its route for the light rail project, named <a href="Central%20Link">Central Link</a>, in November 1999, including four of the five stations in the downtown transit tunnel (excluding Convention Place). <a href="King%20County%20Executive">King County Executive</a> Ron Sims proposed transferring ownership of the tunnel, along with $130 million in debt and liabilities for maintenance and operations, from King County Metro to Sound Transit in 2004. The two agencies signed an agreement in May 2000 that formally transferred ownership and responsibility for the tunnel to Sound Transit, in exchange for $195.6 million paid to King County Metro. Metro would retain ownership of Convention Place station and other assets, while Sound Transit would convert the tunnel to rail operation after 2004.

Sound Transit underwent a funding crisis in 2001 after the Central Link light rail project was found to be over budget and would not be able to open until 2009, three years later than planned. The light rail project was truncated to Westlake station in Downtown Seattle and to <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila</a>, the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date. The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network. In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.

Sound Transit and the King County Council signed a new joint-operations agreement in June 2002, leaving King County Metro as owners of the tunnel and Sound Transit responsible for paying part of the tunnel's debt service at an estimated cost of $65 million. The agreement would allow for buses and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A separate agreement signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.

Metro began testing a fleet of new hybrid diesel-electric buses in 2002, intending to use them in the bus tunnel before and after the conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated bus</a>es began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single dual-mode bus in service on the final day.

In February 2004, Sound Transit announced that it would begin the closure and renovation of the bus tunnel in September 2005, two years earlier than scheduled, to save money and reduce construction delays. Construction of a stub tunnel under Pine Street near Convention Place station, to be used for light rail train storage and turnback, as well as a future extension to Capitol Hill, began in January 2005. The bus tunnel was closed on September 24, 2005, moving the tunnel's 21 routes and 140 buses per hour to surface streets. 3rd Avenue was converted to a "transit-priority corridor" during peak periods, restricting general traffic to one-block travel.

The $82.7 million construction contract for the transit tunnel renovation was awarded to <a href="Balfour%20Beatty">Balfour Beatty</a> in August 2004, 12 percent below Sound Transit's estimates. The majority of the cost was paid by Sound Transit and supplemented by $8.1 million from King County Metro. As part of the renovations, the tunnel's roadway was lowered by to allow for level boarding, required by the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>; as a result, Metro added <a href="strobe%20light">strobe light</a>s to bus mirrors, which were lowered to head height, and added warning signs. New electrical, mechanical, and emergency systems were installed, along with a new communications system connecting to a joint-operations center. The project ended up costing $94 million in total, 3.4 percent over the budget set in 2004. During the closure, Metro found that average travel time through downtown increased only 11 percent during the afternoon peak period, and ridership on popular routes only dropped slightly.

The tunnel reopened to service on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes modified to group common destinations together. Initially, the reopened tunnel was in use only on weekdays, with Saturday operation not yet reinstated. Stations were given new entrance signs, lighting fixtures, electronic <a href="passenger%20information%20system">passenger information signs</a>, and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in place after the reopening, along with the <a href="skip-stop">skip-stop</a> service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel's new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced. The tunnel had remained closed on weekends after its reopening, but Saturday operation was reinstated and Sunday operation was introduced in May 2009.

Simulated light rail testing in the tunnel also began on May 20, 2009, with two-car trains operating alongside in-service buses, making it the first joint bus and rail tunnel with stations in the United States; the <a href="Mount%20Washington%20Transit%20Tunnel">Mount Washington Transit Tunnel</a>, a joint bus and rail tunnel in <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, had already been in operation but lacked underground stations. Service on the Central Link light rail line began on July 18, 2009, operating from Westlake station in the tunnel to <a href="Tukwila%20International%20Boulevard%20station">Tukwila International Boulevard station</a> near the airport. Light rail service was extended north from Westlake to University of Washington station (via <a href="Capitol%20Hill%20station">Capitol Hill station</a>) on March 19, 2016, coinciding with the moving of several bus routes out of the tunnel to accommodate increased train frequencies. The ramp from International District/Chinatown station to the Interstate 90 express lanes was closed in September 2018 as part of preparations for East Link construction.

In November 2015, King County Metro signed a $147 million agreement to sell Convention Place station to the Washington State Convention Center for redevelopment. The convention center plans to build a new expansion on the property, necessitating the closure of the station and transit tunnel to buses earlier than planned. In 2017, Sound Transit and the Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the tunnel would become rail-only in 2019, two years sooner than the planned switch in 2021 to coincide with the opening of the <a href="Northgate%20Link%20Extension">Northgate Link Extension</a>. Convention Place station was permanently closed on July 21, 2018, and was replaced with a set of bus stops on 9th Avenue and a new tunnel access ramp.

Bus service in the tunnel is scheduled to end on March 23, 2019, and Sound Transit is expected to take over operations of the tunnel in 2020. The remaining 830 bus trips through the tunnel, serving approximately 37,000 riders on seven routes, will be redirected onto surface streets. Metro and the city government will also increase surface street capacity for buses by implementing all-door boarding, improving signal timing, and adding a new north–south corridor on 5th and 6th avenues. During the transition to train-only operations, Sound Transit plans to build connections to the <a href="East%20Link%20Extension">East Link</a> rail line at International District/Chinatown station in early 2020. Over a ten-week period, four-car Central Link trains would run on a single track within the tunnel, with through-passengers transferring at Pioneer Square station via a temporary center platform. The tunnel would also be closed for three weekends.

HMS Agincourt (1913)

HMS "Agincourt" was a <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> built in the United Kingdom in the early 1910s. Originally part of Brazil's role in a <a href="South%20American%20dreadnought%20race">South American naval arms race</a>, she holds the distinction of mounting more heavy guns (fourteen) and more <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a> (seven) than any other dreadnought battleship, in keeping with the Brazilians' requirement for an especially impressive design.

Brazil ordered the ship in 1911 as "Rio de Janeiro" from the British company <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a>. However, the collapse of Brazil's <a href="rubber%20boom">rubber boom</a> and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The Ottomans renamed her "Sultan Osman I", after the <a href="Osman%20I">empire's founder</a>, and the ship was nearly complete when <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> broke out. The British government seized her for use by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, together with <a href="HMS%20Erin">another Ottoman dreadnought</a> being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the Ottoman government to join the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>.

Renamed HMS "Agincourt" by the Royal Navy, she joined the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. During the war, the ship spent the bulk of her time on patrols and exercises, although she did participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in 1916. "Agincourt" was put into <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">reserve</a> in 1919 and sold for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> in 1922 to meet the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.

In the unstable period during and following the <a href="Decline%20and%20fall%20of%20Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil%23Fall">1889 coup in Brazil</a>, which deposed <a href="Politics%20of%20the%20Empire%20of%20Brazil">Emperor</a> <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a>, and the <a href="Revolta%20da%20Armada">1893–94 navy revolt</a>, the Brazilian Navy found itself unable to care for its own ships, let alone acquire new vessels. Meanwhile, Chile had agreed to a <a href="Cordillera%20of%20the%20Andes%20Boundary%20Case%201902">naval-limiting pact</a> in 1902 with Brazil's principal rival, Argentina, as part of solving a larger boundary dispute, but they both retained the vessels built in the interim, many of which were significantly more modern and powerful than Brazil's ships. The Brazilian Navy was left behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quantity as well—by the turn of the 20th century, Chile's total naval tonnage was , Argentina's , and Brazil's —even though Brazil had nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times that of Chile.

<a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29%23Early%2020th%20century">Rising international demand for coffee</a> and <a href="rubber%20boom">rubber</a> in the early 20th century brought Brazil an influx of revenue. Simultaneously, the <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Paranhos%2C%20Baron%20of%20Rio%20Branco">Baron of Rio Branco</a> spearheaded a drive by prominent Brazilians to force the leading world nations to recognize Brazil as an international power. The <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress of Brazil</a> inaugurated a large naval acquisition program in late 1904. They ordered three small battleships in 1906, but the launch of caused the Brazilian Navy to reconsider their purchase. In March 1907, they signed a contract for three s. Two ships would be constructed immediately by the British companies <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a>, with the third to follow.

Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact and sought dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a <a href="Rivadavia-class%20battleship%23Bidding">drawn-out bidding process</a>, went to an American company, <a href="Fore%20River%20Shipyard">Fore River Shipbuilding Company</a>, while Chile's orders, delayed by the <a href="1906%20Valpara%C3%ADso%20earthquake">1906 Valparaíso earthquake</a>, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were warming and the country's economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down "Rio de Janeiro"s <a href="keel">keel</a> in March 1910.

The Brazilian Navy had divided into two distinct factions, based on the size of the main battery. The outgoing naval minister favoured an increase over the 12-inch guns mounted on board the "Minas Geraes" class, while his incoming counterpart, Admiral <a href="Marques%20Le%C3%A3o">Marques Leão</a>, favoured keeping the smaller but faster-firing gun. While the exact influences upon the Brazilian government are unclear, Leão was advocating strongly for his position in meetings with the President. Other events probably influenced them as well, such as the November 1910 <a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Lash">Revolt of the Lash</a>, payments on loans taken out for the dreadnoughts, and a worsening economy that had led to high <a href="government%20debt">government debt</a> compounded by <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">budget deficits</a>. By May 1911, the President had made up his mind:

When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship "Rio de Janeiro", a vessel of 32,000 tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.

A contract to build the ship that would become "Agincourt" was signed on 3 June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14 September 1911. The design called for fourteen 12-inch guns, an extreme number that historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing the total number of guns.

"Agincourt" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced at load and at deep load. The ship had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load. She had a large turning circle, but manoeuvred well despite her great length. She was considered to be a good gun platform.

When she came to serve in the Royal Navy, "Agincourt" was considered a particularly comfortable ship and very well-appointed internally. A knowledge of <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> was necessary to work many of the fittings—including those in the <a href="head%20%28watercraft%29">heads</a>—as the original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by the British. In 1917, her crew numbered 1,268 officers and men.

"Agincourt" had four <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> direct-drive <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The high-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the wing shafts while the low-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the inner shafts. The three-bladed propellers were in diameter. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but achieved more than during her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, slightly exceeding her designed speed of .

The steam plant consisted of twenty-two <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s with an operating pressure of . "Agincourt" normally carried of coal, but could carry a maximum of , as well as of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . Electrical power was provided by four steam-driven reciprocating <a href="electrical%20generator">electrical generator</a>s.

"Agincourt" mounted fourteen <a href="EOC%2012%20inch/45%20naval%20gun">BL 12-inch Mk XIII</a> 45-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> guns in seven twin hydraulically powered turrets, unofficially named after the days of the week, starting from Sunday, forward to aft. This was the largest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a dreadnought battleship. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of just over with <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing (AP)</a> shells. During the war the turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16°, but this only extended the range to . The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5 rounds per minute. When a full <a href="broadside">broadside</a> was fired, "the resulting sheet of flame was big enough to create the impression that a battle cruiser had blown up; it was awe inspiring." No damage was done to the ship when firing full broadsides, despite the common idea that doing so would break the ship in half, but much of the ship's <a href="tableware">tableware</a> and glassware did shatter when "Agincourt" fired her first broadside.

As built, "Agincourt" mounted eighteen <a href="BL%206%20inch%20Mk%20XIII%20naval%20gun">BL 6-inch Mk XIII</a> 50-calibre guns. Fourteen were placed in armoured <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s on the upper deck and two each in the fore and aft superstructures, protected by <a href="gun%20shield">gun shield</a>s. Two more were added abreast the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> in pivot mounts protected by gun shields when the ship was purchased by the British. The guns could be depressed to −7° and elevated to 13°, later increased to 15°. They had a range of at 15° when firing a shell with a muzzle velocity of . Their rate of fire was about five to seven rounds per minute, but this dropped to about three rounds per minute after the ready ammunition was used up because the ammunition hoists were too slow or few to keep the guns fully supplied. About 150 rounds were carried per gun.

Close-range defence against <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s was provided by ten 45-calibre <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing</a> guns. These were mounted in the superstructure in pivot mounts and protected by gun shields. "Agincourt" also carried three <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo">21 inch (533 mm)</a> submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s; one was on each beam and the last was in the stern. The water that entered the torpedo tubes when they were fired was discharged into the torpedo flat to facilitate reloading the tube and then pumped overboard. This meant that the torpedo crewmen would be operating in of water if rapid fire was required. Ten torpedoes were carried for them.

Each turret was fitted with an armoured <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> in the turret roof. In addition, another one was mounted on top of the foretop. By the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> in 1916, "Agincourt" was possibly the only dreadnought of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> not fitted with a <a href="Frederic%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer fire-control table</a>. A <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> was later fitted below the foretop and one turret was modified to control the entire main armament later in the war. A director for the guns was added on each side in 1916–17. A high-angle rangefinder was added in 1918 to the spotting top.

So much weight had been devoted to "Agincourt"s armament that little remained for her armour. Her waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> was just thick, compared with twelve inches or more found in other British dreadnoughts. It ran some , from the forward edge of "Monday" <a href="barbette">barbette</a> to the middle of "Friday" barbette. Forward of this the belt thinned to six inches for about before further reducing to all the way to the bow. Aft of the midships section the belt reduced to six inches for about and then thinned to four inches (102 mm); it did not reach the stern, but terminated at the rear <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>. The upper belt extended from the main to the upper deck and was six inches thick. It ran from "Monday" barbette to "Thursday" barbette. The armour bulkheads at each end of the ship angled inwards from the ends of the midships armoured belts to the end barbettes and were three inches thick. Four of "Agincourt"s decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from .

The armour of the barbettes constituted a major weakness in "Agincourt"s protection. They were 9 inches thick above the upper deck level, but decreased to 3 inches between the upper and main decks and had no armour at all below the main deck except for "Sunday" barbette (which had 3 inches), and "Thursday" and "Saturday" barbettes (which had 2 inches). The turret armour was 12 inches thick on the face, on the side and in the rear. The turret roofs were 3 inches thick at the front and 2 inches at the rear. The casemates for the secondary armament were protected by 6 inches of armour and were defended from <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a> by 6-inch-thick bulkheads.

The main <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was protected by 12 inches of armour on its sides and it had a 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine was protected by two armour plates on each side as <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s, the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.

"Agincourt" had another weakness in that she was not subdivided to Royal Navy standards as the Brazilians preferred to eliminate all possible watertight bulkheads that might limit the size of the compartments and interfere with the crew's comfort. One example was the officer's <a href="wardroom">wardroom</a>, which was in size, much larger than anything in the Grand Fleet.

Approximately of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck after the Battle of Jutland to protect the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>s. Two <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns were added to the quarterdeck in 1917–18. A rangefinder was added to the former <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> platform on the <a href="foremast">foremast</a> at the same time. A high-angle rangefinder was added to the <a href="Top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">spotting top</a> in 1918.

"Rio de Janeiro", as "Agincourt" was named by her first owners, was <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a> on 14 September 1911 by Armstrongs in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 22 January 1913. After the keel-laying the Brazilian government found itself in an unenviable position: a European depression after the end of the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a> in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans, while at the same time Brazil's coffee and rubber exports collapsed, the latter due to the loss of the <a href="Rubber%20boom%23The%20end%20of%20the%20Amazon%27s%20rubber%20monopoly">Brazilian rubber monopoly</a> to British plantations in the Far East. In addition, reports on new dreadnought construction coming in from overseas indicated that the vessel would be outclassed upon completion. These factors caused Brazil to put the ship up for sale in October 1913, and she was sold to the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> for £2,750,000 on 28 December 1913. Renamed "Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel", she underwent trials in July 1914 and was completed in August, just as World War I began.

The war broke out during her sea trials before delivery. Even though the Ottoman crew had arrived to collect her, the British Government took over the vessel for incorporation into the Royal Navy. The Turkish captain, waiting with five hundred Turkish sailors aboard a transport in the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a>, threatened to board his ships and hoist the Turkish flag; <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill%23First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Winston Churchill</a> gave orders to resist such an attempt "by armed force if necessary." At the same time the British also took over a second Ottoman battleship, a -derived vessel being built by Vickers—"Reşadiye"—which was renamed . Such an action was allowed for in the contracts, as Churchill did not want to risk the ships being used against the British, but it had consequences.

The takeover caused considerable ill will in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, where public subscriptions had partially funded the ships. When the Ottoman government had been in a financial deadlock over the budget of the battleships, donations for the Ottoman Navy had come in from taverns, cafés, schools and markets, and large donations were rewarded with a "Navy Donation Medal". The seizure, and the gift of the German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> to the Ottomans, influenced public opinion in the Empire to turn away from Britain, and they entered the war on the side of Germany and the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> against the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a> of Britain, France, and Russia on 29 October, after "Goeben" had <a href="Black%20Sea%20Raid">attacked Russian facilities</a> in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.

The Royal Navy made modifications to "Agincourt" before commissioning her: in particular it removed the flying bridge over the two centre turrets. The ship was also initially fitted with <a href="squat%20toilet">Turkish-style lavatories</a> that had to be replaced. Her name, "Agincourt", was a favourite of Churchill's, and had initially been allocated to a sixth vessel of the ordered under the 1914–15 Naval Estimates, but not yet begun at the war's outbreak. Her nickname, "The Gin Palace", came from her luxurious fittings and a corruption of her name (A Gin Court), <a href="pink%20gin">pink gin</a> being a popular drink among Royal Navy officers at the time.

The Admiralty was unprepared to man a ship of "Agincourt"s size on such short notice and her crew was drawn "from the highest and lowest echelons of the service: the Royal yachts, and the detention barracks." "Agincourt"s captain and executive officer came from , most of whose crew was also transferred to "Agincourt" on 3 August 1914. Most of the naval reservists had already been called up by this time and sent to other ships, so a number of minor criminals who had had their sentences remitted were received from various naval prisons and detention camps.

"Agincourt" was <a href="Shakedown%20%28testing%29">working up</a> until 7 September 1914, when she joined the <a href="4th%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Battle Squadron</a> (BS) of the Grand Fleet. The fleet anchorage at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> was not yet secure against submarine attack and much of the fleet was kept at sea, where "Agincourt" spent forty of her first eighty days with the Grand Fleet. This was the beginning of "a year and a half of inaction, only broken by occasional North Sea 'sweeps' intended to draw the enemy from his bases."
On 1 January 1915, "Agincourt" was still assigned to the 4th BS, but had been assigned to the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battle Squadron</a> before the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. She was the last ship of the Sixth Division of the 1st BS, along with , and the flagship, , the most heterogeneous group possible as each ship was from a different class. The Sixth Division was the starboardmost column of the Grand Fleet as it headed south to rendezvous with the ships of <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Admiral Beatty</a>'s <a href="Battlecruiser%20Fleet">Battlecruiser Fleet</a>, then engaged with their opposite numbers from the German <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Jellicoe</a>, commander of the Grand Fleet, kept it in cruising formation until 6:15 p.m. when he ordered it to deploy from column into a single line based on the port division, each ship turning 90° in succession. This turn made the Sixth Division the closest ships in the Grand Fleet to the battleships of the High Seas Fleet and they fired on each ship as they made their turn to port. This concentration of fire later became known as "Windy Corner" to the British as the ships were drenched by German shell splashes although none were hit.
At 6:24 "Agincourt" opened fire on a German battlecruiser with her main guns. Shortly afterwards her six-inch guns followed suit as German destroyers made torpedo attacks on the British battleships to cover the turn to the south of the High Seas Fleet. "Agincourt" successfully evaded two torpedoes, although another struck "Marlborough". Visibility cleared around 7:15 and she engaged a without result before it was lost in the smoke and haze. Around 8:00 "Marlborough" was forced to reduce speed because of the strain on her bulkheads from her torpedo damage and her division mates conformed to her speed. In the reduced visibility the division lost sight of the Grand Fleet during the night, passing the badly damaged battlecruiser without opening fire. Dawn found them with only the detritus from the previous day's battle in sight and the division arrived back at Scapa Flow on 2 June. "Agincourt" fired 144 twelve-inch shells and 111 six-inch shells during the battle, although she is not known to have hit anything.
Although the Grand Fleet made several sorties over the next few years it is not known if "Agincourt" participated in them. On 23 April 1918, "Agincourt" and "Hercules" were stationed at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached their normal route so Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Scheer</a> ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.

"Agincourt" was later transferred to the <a href="2nd%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battle Squadron</a> and was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918. She was placed in reserve at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 to comply with the tonnage limitations of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.

Marcus Trescothick

Marcus Edward Trescothick (born 25 December 1975) is an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er and former international cricketer, who stood in as Test and ODI captain on several occasions. He plays <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a> for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset County Cricket Club</a>, and represented <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> in 76 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> and 123 <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a>s. 

A left-handed <a href="opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a>, he made his first-class debut for Somerset in 1993 and quickly established himself as a regular member of the team. Trescothick made his One Day International (ODI) debut seven years later, against <a href="Zimbabwe%20national%20cricket%20team">Zimbabwe</a> in July 2000. His Test debut, against the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>, followed in August. Although former <a href="English%20national%20cricket%20captains">England captain</a> <a href="Nasser%20Hussain">Nasser Hussain</a> likened Trescothick's build and batting temperament to that of <a href="Graham%20Gooch">Graham Gooch</a>, his stroke play is more reminiscent of <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a>. 

An aggressive opener: he holds the record for the most ODI centuries of any English player, and for the fastest half-century in English <a href="Twenty20">Twenty20</a> cricket. Trescothick is also an accomplished <a href="slip%20%28cricket%29">slip fielder</a> and occasional right-handed <a href="medium%20pace%20bowling">medium pace</a> <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a> who has <a href="wicket-keeper">kept wicket</a> for England in five ODIs, and deputised as England captain for two Test matches and ten ODIs.

Trescothick was an automatic choice for England between 2000 and 2006, before a stress-related illness threatened his career and forced him to pull out of the national squad.

Trescothick was immersed into cricket from an early age. His father, Martyn, played two matches for Somerset's Second XI and was a good amateur player, appearing for <a href="Bristol%20and%20District%20Cricket%20Association">Bristol and District Cricket Association</a> between 1967 and 1976. They played together in competitive <a href="West%20of%20England%20Premier%20League">Western League</a> matches while his mother, Lin, made the <a href="club%20cricket">club teas</a>. He was educated at the <a href="Sir%20Bernard%20Lovell%20School">Sir Bernard Lovell School</a> in <a href="Oldland%20Common">Oldland Common</a> near <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where his exceptional scores for the school were rewarded with a Somerset contract in 1993. He was <a href="nickname">nickname</a>d "Tresco" and "Banger", the latter deriving from his diet as a young player:

My diet was sausages then, in no particular order, sausages, chips, sausages, toast, sausages, beans, sausages, cheese, sausages, eggs, and the occasional sausage.
Trescothick married Hayley Rowse in <a href="Trull">Trull</a>, Somerset, on 24 January 2004, and the couple have two daughters, Ellie Louise (born April 2005) and Millie Grace (born January 2008). He lives in <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a>, and also owns property in <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, near similar properties owned by <a href="Michael%20Vaughan">Michael Vaughan</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Flintoff">Andrew Flintoff</a>. Trescothick is an honorary vice-president of <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City F.C.</a>, as well as being a keen <a href="golf">golf</a>er. Outside sport, he has been recognised with a <a href="Taunton%20Deane">Taunton Deane</a> Citizenship Award, and was granted the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom</a> of his home town, Keynsham.

Trescothick's first full season at Somerset in 1994 was one of his best, where he scored a total of 925 runs, including two <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> and eight half-centuries at an impressive <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 48.63. Having played for the <a href="English%20U-19%20cricket%20team">English U-19 cricket team</a> against the <a href="West%20Indian%20U-19%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> in 1993, and <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20U-19%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="Indian%20U-19%20cricket%20team">India</a> in 1994, Trescothick was named captain for the two Under-19 series against West Indies and <a href="South%20African%20U-19%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a> in 1995. His career aggregate of 1,032 runs for England U-19 is second only to <a href="John%20Crawley">John Crawley</a>'s 1,058.
Trescothick was not as successful in domestic cricket in 1995, although there were still some highlights including an innings of 151 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> (a third of his season's total), and a <a href="Hat-trick%20%28cricket%29">hat-trick</a>, including the wicket of century-maker <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a>, for Somerset against Young Australia. Trescothick's England Under-19 form was still excellent, averaging 74.62 with the bat in six matches. His Under-19 team mates would often mock him for wearing an England blazer after his matches; Trescothick would reply by saying that "it might be the closest I get to playing for England".

The following five years were mixed for Trescothick. Averaging about 30 runs per <a href="innings">innings</a>, he was often criticised for a lack of foot movement. <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a> described Trescothick's technique by saying "he does not need to move a long way but needs to move enough. When he is playing well ... he is very good at transferring weight. When he is not playing well, his feet get stuck". However, Trescothick was awarded the <a href="NBC%20Denis%20Compton%20Award">NBC Denis Compton Award</a> for Somerset's most promising young county player in the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In 1997, Somerset Second XI were set 612 to win by Warwickshire Second XI, and Trescothick scored 322 to bring the Seconds to 605.

In 1999, Trescothick impressed <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> coach <a href="Duncan%20Fletcher">Duncan Fletcher</a> in a <a href="County%20Championship">county match</a> at <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">Taunton</a>, by scoring 167 in a low-scoring match where the next-highest innings was 50. When England opening batsman <a href="Nick%20Knight%20%28cricketer%29">Nick Knight</a> sustained a finger injury in 2000, Fletcher, who had been appointed England coach, called on Trescothick to make his England debut in the <a href="NatWest%20Series">NatWest Series</a> against <a href="Zimbabwe%20national%20cricket%20team">Zimbabwe</a> and the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>. Trescothick's regular selection for England meant that he was rarely available for domestic selection between 2000 and 2006, often playing only a few matches for Somerset at the start of the season.

Trescothick participated in two <a href="England%20Lions%20cricket%20team">England A</a> tours during the winter of 1999, but his full One Day International debut came against Zimbabwe at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> on 9 July 2000, when he scored 79. He continued his good form in the <a href="NatWest%20Series">tournament</a> with a <a href="Man%20of%20the%20Match">Man of the Match</a>-winning 87 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> against the West Indies at <a href="Riverside%20Ground">Chester-le-street</a>, amassing 288 runs at an average of 48.00 and taking two wickets against Zimbabwe at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a>.

As a result of his good form in the NatWest series, Trescothick was given his Test match debut later that summer in the third Test against the West Indies at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a>. He displayed a calm temperament when England lost early wickets, scoring 66 and forming a partnership of 179 with <a href="Alec%20Stewart">Alec Stewart</a>. Journalist Thrasy Petropoulos observed that there was "poise and durability...just as there had been enterprise and verve to his impressive start in the one-day arena." He ended the Test series with an average of 47.50.
England began the 2000–2001 winter tour with the <a href="2000%20ICC%20KnockOut%20Trophy">2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy</a> at <a href="Nairobi%20Gymkhana%20Club">Nairobi Gymkhana Club</a>. Trescothick did not score highly in the tournament, and England were knocked out at the quarter-final stage against South Africa. Trescothick was named the <a href="Professional%20Cricketers%27%20Association">Professional Cricketers' Association</a> Player of the Year for his performances for Somerset throughout 2000.

Trescothick's maiden international century came against the <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> Governor's XI in October 2000, during the first warm-up match to the <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> series. Trescothick reached his highest score (71) of the three Test matches in the opening innings of the first Test. He took his sole Test wicket in the third Test, when <a href="Ashley%20Giles">Ashley Giles</a> caught the Pakistan opener <a href="Imran%20Nazir">Imran Nazir</a>.

Trescothick started the <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> tour with a century against a Sri Lanka 'Colts XI'. He was the top scorer in both innings of the first Test with 122 and 57, although this was overshadowed by <a href="Marvan%20Atapattu">Marvan Atapattu</a>'s 201 not out in Sri Lanka's innings. Trescothick averaged 41.33 in the Test series, but only 16.00 in the three subsequent ODIs.

England played two Test matches against Pakistan in June 2001. Although Trescothick scored 117 in the second Test, it was not enough for England to win the match. His ODI form improved at the start of the 2001 NatWest Series against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and Pakistan, with scores of 69 and 137 respectively. However, his series ended with two consecutive <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">ducks</a>, and England lost all their matches in the tournament.

Although Trescothick was England's second highest run scorer in the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202001">2001 Ashes series</a>, he displayed a tendency to give his wicket away when "well set". England lost the series 4–1, with the majority of the England batsmen's contributions being overshadowed by <a href="Mark%20Butcher">Mark Butcher</a>'s 173 not out to win the fourth Test. Trescothick's apparent inability to make major scores was again apparent in the 2001–02 One Day International series in Zimbabwe, where he only passed 50 on one occasion despite scoring consistently. He also captained the side for the first time in this series, deputising for the injured <a href="Nasser%20Hussain">Nasser Hussain</a>.

Trescothick really came into his own on the winter tour of <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in 2001. The three-Test series saw him averaging 48.00, with a highest score of 99. He was England's best batsman in the ODI series, averaging 53.00 with a <a href="strike%20rate">strike rate</a> of over 100. He scored a century in the first ODI, although England lost by 22 runs. He established a reputation for keeping his composure while the rest of the team were failing; at this point, none of Trescothick's four international centuries had resulted in an England win. He was also man-of-the-match in the final ODI, setting up an England victory, with 95 runs from 80 balls. This tour established Trescothick's reputation as one of England's best batsmen against <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a>: according to David Gower, he was "judging line and length very well". "<a href="Indian%20Cricket%20%28annual%29">Indian Cricket</a>" named him one of their five Cricketers of the Year for 2002. The following tour of <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> was less successful for Trescothick, only once reaching double figures in a poor ODI series, coupled with an average Test match performance.

Trescothick had been playing well in 2002, scoring 161 in the <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202002">Sri Lankan series</a> and being awarded the Player of the Series in the tri-nation NatWest Series (including a century in the final), until his season was cut short when he <a href="bone%20fracture">fractured</a> his thumb while fielding. He returned for the fourth Test against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a>, scoring two half-centuries. Trescothick had mixed fortunes in the <a href="2002%20ICC%20Champions%20Trophy">2002 ICC Champions Trophy</a>; he followed his century in the NatWest final with a man-of-the-match winning 119 against Zimbabwe, but failed to score as England lost to India and exited the tournament.

In October, Trescothick was one of 11 players awarded "central contracts" by the <a href="England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board">ECB</a>, which compensate a player's county for their lack of domestic appearances.

Trescothick was overshadowed by <a href="Michael%20Vaughan">Michael Vaughan</a> during the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202002-03">2002–03 Ashes series</a>, averaging only 26.10 with a top score of 72 in comparison to Vaughan's average of 63.30 and three centuries. Trescothick averaged 31.60 across 10 matches in the <a href="Australian%20Tri-Series">VB Series</a>, but England were outplayed by Australia throughout the tour. Trescothick failed to excel in the <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 World Cup</a> as England failed to qualify for the knock-out stages. In his five matches, Trescothick's top score was 58 against <a href="Namibia%20national%20cricket%20team">Namibia</a>, with a tournament average of 23.20.

Trescothick played well against a weak Zimbabwe side in the two-Test series in May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> averaging over 100. His form continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. The opening stand with <a href="Vikram%20Solanki">Vikram Solanki</a> of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained his form in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.

In Bangladesh, scores in the nineties against both the President's XI and Bangladesh A were followed by a century in the first Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one half century in the three ODIs, although England only used five batsman in the comfortable victories. England played poorly against <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a>, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted to take control of the match with 70 at <a href="Sinhalese%20Sports%20Club%20Ground">Colombo</a>, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.

His form in the tour to the West Indies in March and April 2004 was mixed. After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a substantial match-winning contribution. This poor touring form may have been the start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, "The hardest thing for me has been the pitches. So far <a href="Cricket%20nets">nets</a> and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you get used to good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes pretty easy [sic]." However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.

Back in England, Trescothick was called upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan sustained a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant <a href="Andrew%20Strauss">Andrew Strauss</a> against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a>. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became the first player to make centuries in both innings of a Test match at <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a>, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the <a href="2004%20ICC%20Champions%20Trophy">2004 ICC Champions Trophy</a>, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.

The 2004–5 tour of <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> caused several players to voice their concerns about the <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> regime, the security issues in the country, and the standard of the Zimbabwean side. <a href="Steve%20Harmison">Steve Harmison</a> was the first to boycott the tour for "political and sporting reasons", and Flintoff was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself. The England Chairman of Selectors <a href="David%20Graveney">David Graveney</a> denied that the selectors would leave out players unhappy with touring Zimbabwe and would put their absences down to injury. Flintoff and Trescothick were, however, "rested" allowing <a href="Kevin%20Pietersen">Kevin Pietersen</a> to make his debut.

Trescothick used the time to prepare for the following series in South Africa, even took up <a href="yoga">yoga</a> in attempt to bolster his performances abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against an <a href="Nicky%20Oppenheimer">N.F. Oppenheimer XI</a> in South Africa. A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second, in which they both scored over 130. This was a record opening partnership at <a href="Kingsmead%20cricket%20ground%2C%20Durban">Durban</a> and England's first 200 opening stand since Gooch and <a href="Mike%20Atherton">Mike Atherton</a> in 1991. Before this, the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20, and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this. With regard to his touring difficulties, Trescothick stated "I wouldn't say I've put it to rest, but I've made a big step forward to putting it to rest. It's a mental battle for me, something I have to deal with and work hard to try to understand what is different. He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. After batting slowly with <a href="Ashley%20Giles">Ashley Giles</a>, the fall of <a href="Matthew%20Hoggard">Hoggard</a>'s wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start "unleashing ferocious shots", setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him. In the matches preceding the <a href="2005%20Ashes%20series">2005 Ashes series</a>, England wrapped up two easy victories against <a href="Bangladesh%20national%20cricket%20team">Bangladesh</a>. Trescothick scored 194 in the first Test, and 151 in the second. He also scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI, surpassing Gooch's record of eight ODI centuries for England.

Trescothick fared better in 2005 than in the previous Ashes series, becoming the second highest run scorer in the series (behind the prolific <a href="Kevin%20Pietersen">Kevin Pietersen</a>). During the third Test, he became the fastest player to reach 5,000 runs in Test cricket, and also achieved the notable feat of scoring over 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year for the third consecutive year: 1,004 in 2003, 1,003 in 2004, and 1,323 in 2005. He also had the dubious honour of becoming both <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a>'s 500th and <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a>'s 600th Test wicket during the series. Trescothick was named as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> for his achievements in 2005, and was awarded an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> in the <a href="New%20Year%20Honours%202006">2006 New Year honours list</a> with the rest of the English team.

For the Test series against <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a>, Trescothick was offered the captaincy once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as "unofficial second in command...I believe it was the right thing to step up. It is exciting to think I could be in charge for a few weeks...I know there is a chance I maybe won't be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I've seen the things it [captaincy] does to you." As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.

During <a href="English%20cricket%20team">England</a>'s tour of India in February 2006, Trescothick abruptly returned home citing personal reasons. He later blamed a virus.

Trescothick returned to Test cricket in May, scoring 106 against Sri Lanka to become the first Test centurion of the <a href="2006%20English%20cricket%20season">2006 English season</a>. The century proved to be the high point of Trescothick's Test summer, however, as he reached a half-century just once in the subsequent six Tests against Sri Lanka and <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a>. This run of form was lifted later in the year by two ODI centuries, one apiece against <a href="Ireland%20cricket%20team">Ireland</a> and Sri Lanka. In September, he withdrew from the remaining ODIs against Pakistan and asked not to be considered for the forthcoming <a href="2006%20ICC%20Champions%20Trophy">ICC Champions Trophy</a> squad because of a stress-related illness. It was later believed likely that Trescothick had been suffering from <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a>, which was also the cause of much of his trouble throughout 2006.

Returning once again to the international arena, Trescothick was included in the squad for the <a href="2006-07%20Ashes%20series">2006–07 Ashes</a> in Australia, and played in the first two tour matches against the <a href="Prime%20Minister%27s%20XI">Prime Minister's XI</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>. On 14 November, following the match against New South Wales, England announced Trescothick was flying home due to a "recurrence of a stress-related illness". <a href="Geoffrey%20Boycott">Geoffrey Boycott</a> later stated that depression amongst cricketers is rarely documented, but with the current congested <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">ICC</a> schedule, player "burnout" and similar illnesses were becoming more commonplace.

Trescothick's uncertainty over his place in the England squad drew varied criticism. However, he also received support from respected players, including Somerset captain <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a>, <a href="Alec%20Stewart">Alec Stewart</a>, <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Woolmer">Bob Woolmer</a>.

Trescothick ended some speculation about his international career by announcing that he would like to be considered for a place in the national side in the future. England's management staff continued to support him, and named him in the initial 25-man squad for the 2007 Test series against the West Indies. Having recovered from a double <a href="hernia">hernia</a> operation, and proving himself fit for the start of the <a href="county%20cricket">county</a> season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against <a href="Devon%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Devon</a> on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502–4 off their 50 overs.

His comeback to the County Championship continued with a 44-ball half-century against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> on 19 April 2007, while in May he hit a career-best 284 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, although Trescothick stated then that he did not feel ready for an international Test match position. Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.

Debate over Trescothick's place in the England squad continued amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, and the rise of <a href="Alastair%20Cook">Alastair Cook</a> as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: "Of course I'd love to play for England again... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." He added that he was "desperate to play for England again" but was waiting until he was "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".

In July 2007, Trescothick was named in the preliminary squad for the <a href="Twenty20%20World%20Championship">Twenty20 World Championship</a> in South Africa, with the full squad to be confirmed on 11 August. However, Trescothick pulled himself out of the squad before the final confirmation date, stating that "[I am] now clear that I should take more time to complete my recovery". The England selectors confirmed that they remained in favour of including Trescothick at some point, looking "forward to his making himself available again for England when the time is right". Trescothick, however, said that he knows England cannot wait for him forever, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract.
Meanwhile, his good domestic form continued with a fast 146 and 69 not out during a four-day match against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, giving Somerset an unlikely victory. A score of 49 from 83 balls followed in the four-day match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, and a score of 84 from 79 balls against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> was followed by a man-of-the-match winning 124 which saw Somerset promoted to the first division of the <a href="National%20League%20%28cricket%29">NatWest Pro40</a>. Of his 2007 season, Somerset director of cricket <a href="Brian%20Rose%20%28cricketer%29">Brian Rose</a> stated that Trescothick had made "terrific progress". Trescothick maintained prolific form throughout the season despite a foot injury, scoring 1,343 runs at an average of 61.04 to guide Somerset to the Division 2 championship. He was awarded a <a href="benefit%20season">benefit year</a> in 2008, following on from successful surgery on an injured <a href="Fifth%20metatarsal%20bone">metatarsal</a>. He remains firm, however, on his decision to stay out of the England team for the sake of his health.

On 15 March 2008, Somerset announced that Trescothick had decided to pull out of the county's pre-season tour of the UAE after suffering a recurrence of his condition, leading many to speculate that, given this latest setback, it seemed increasing unlikely that Trescothick would represent England again. Somerset's director of cricket Brian Rose, however, stated that he didn't "see the setback as a major problem" and that Trescothick would be able to play for Somerset in the following season, and "for many years" after. He would never return to international level, however, and announced his retirement from international cricket on 22 March 2008. He stated that he had "tried on numerous occasions to make it back to the international stage and it has proved a lot more difficult than [he] expected" and repeated his desire to continue playing domestic cricket. He later stated that it was his decision to withdraw from Somerset's tour of <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> that prompted his decision.

In response, <a href="Angus%20Fraser">Angus Fraser</a> wrote: "Obviously, it is sad to see such a dedicated, patriotic and likeable man forced to give up something that patently meant so much to him, but the inner torment that came with attempting to overcome the mental illness that prevented him from touring with England for more than two years had to be brought to an end. It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life". Fraser also wrote: "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since".

After an excellent domestic season for Somerset, including 184 in a 40-over match against <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> (his highest <a href="List%20A%20cricket">List A</a> score), Trescothick released his <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>, "<a href="Coming%20Back%20to%20Me">Coming Back to Me</a>", on 1 September 2008, explaining that he had suffered from <a href="anxiety%20attack">anxiety attack</a>s since the age of 10, and that playing domestic cricket meant that, at all times, he was only ever three hours away from his family. He said,

The book has been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick's difficulties drawing comparison with <a href="Harold%20Gimblett">Harold Gimblett</a>'s similar mental health problems. Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England set-up, Trescothick confirmed that his decision has been made and that he is putting his health and family first. In November 2008 "Coming Back to Me" was named the 2008 <a href="William%20Hill%20Sports%20Book%20of%20the%20Year">William Hill Sports Book of the Year</a>. In April 2009, Trescothick turned down another request from new England captain <a href="Andrew%20Strauss">Andrew Strauss</a> to consider making himself available for England's <a href="World%20Twenty20%20Championship">World Twenty20 Championship</a> campaign.

Trescothick continued his career with Somerset into 2009, having received a benefit year from his county, as well as a new stand in his name. During his benefit year he averaged 46.59 in the 4-day game, including three centuries, and he started 2009 with 52 against Warwickshire. It was also announced on 20 April 2009 that Trescothick has become a <a href="patron">patron</a> of <a href="Anxiety%20UK">Anxiety UK</a>, following the revelations of his biography. As the season progressed, Trescothick found success in all forms of the game. On 1 June, he scored 69 from 47 balls as part of a 129-partnership with <a href="Craig%20Kieswetter">Craig Kieswetter</a> against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>; on 3 June he scored 52 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>; he was stumped five short of his second Championship century of the season against Lancashire; and then scored 78 against Yorkshire on 14 June. By 16 June, he had scored a hundred apiece in the <a href="2009%20Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">Friends Provident Trophy</a> and the <a href="2009%20County%20Championship">County Championship</a>, both with averages in the high 50s. On 31 July, he became the first player in the country to accrue 1,000 first-class runs in the 2009 season during the 1st innings of the <a href="2009%20County%20Championship">County Championship</a> match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. He also performed well in the one day arena, taking Somerset to the final of the Twenty20 championship while continuing to reject any suggestions of returning for the final Test of the <a href="2009%20Ashes">2009 Ashes</a> series. He finished the season as the leading run scorer in the County Championship, scoring 1,817 runs. With the departure of <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a>, Trescothick was named as Somerset captain from 2010 onwards. 
Trescothick was also named <a href="PCA%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Most Valuable Player</a> by the <a href="Professional%20Cricketers%27%20Association">Professional Cricketers' Association</a> for his 2,934 runs in all competitions in the <a href="2009%20English%20cricket%20season">2009 season</a>, 1,745 of these in the County Championship. Over the winter he starred in a short film to promote Somerset, commissioned by inward investment agency <a href="Into%20Somerset">Into Somerset</a>.

With Somerset runners-up in the English <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup">2009 Twenty20 Cup</a>, Trescothick and his county travelled to India to partake in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who was described as having "been in sparkling form all season" and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as this was to be his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a> which read "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course [it is a risk]... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the <a href="Otago%20Volts">Otago Volts</a>. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the <a href="Deccan%20Chargers">Deccan Chargers</a> on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" according to ESPNcricinfo.

Trescothick was unable to avoid a recurrence of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same "stress related illness". <a href="Brian%20Rose%20%28cricketer%29">Brian Rose</a>, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20cricket%20team">Trinidad and Tobago</a> on 12 October, released a statement to the media stating "Marcus admitted a couple of days ago that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over the next two or three years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's "courageous" decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while <a href="Paul%20Hayward%20%28journalist%29">Paul Hayward</a> of the "<a href="Guardian%20%28newspaper%29">Guardian</a>" also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.

Trescothick led Somerset into the 2010 season as captain, and began strongly in the County Championship with a century and four half-centuries from his first eight games, though he struggled in the newly formed <a href="Clydesdale%20Bank%2040">Clydesdale Bank 40</a> with only 95 runs from the first five matches, and in the <a href="Friends%20Provident%20T20">Friends Provident T20</a> 173 runs at 21.62 with a best of 50. This half century came on 25 June, where together with <a href="Kieron%20Pollard">Kieron Pollard</a> helped secure victory over Sussex, and was scored from 31 balls. Despite Trescothick's four-day form, however, Somerset struggled early on, with only one victory over Yorkshire. In a Twenty20 match against Hampshire on 9 July at Taunton, Trescothick hit a half-century from 13 deliveries, including five sixes and five fours – a record fastest fifty in English domestic Twenty20 cricket. He was eventually dismissed for 78 from only 32 balls. He went on to lead Somerset to runners-up position for all three English domestic competitions, losing out to Nottinghamshire in the County Championship, Hampshire in the Twenty20 and Warwickshire in the <a href="CB40">CB40</a> competition.

In 2011 Trescothick started off the county championship season very strongly and was the first batsman in the country to score 1000 championship runs. He was awarded the 2011 season MVP (Most Valuable Player) award for his performances throughout the season. He ended 2011 with six centuries in the County Championship, batting with an average of 79.66 across the year. Somerset earned record financial returns that year, but again failed in the semi-final and final stages of all major competitions.

Across all three formats, Trescothick took 2,518 runs for his county. ESPNcricinfo's George Dobell noted in their end of season round-up that "He continues to dominate county attacks in a way that only Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash – of recent batsmen – could match. There are times when he makes the bowlers' job appear impossible." However, as 2012 – Trescothick's 19th season at Somerset – approached, there was talk of resting him from the newly formed one-day cricket championship that following year. Trescothick did not travel with the rest of the side to the <a href="Champions%20League%20T20">Champions League T20</a> in India. He missed part of the 2012 domestic season due to an ankle injury, and struggled for form going seven four-day matches without a half-century until passing fifty against Sussex in August and going on to score a century. By the end of the season he had played only five one day games, scoring 118 runs at 39.33, two T20 matches making only 31 runs in total, and nine County Championship games in which he scored 506 runs at 38.92, including two centuries. This was his lowest home-season aggregate since 1995. He nevertheless made a statement to the media voicing his wish to continue playing into his forties, and took up a winter commentary stint with <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> to cover England's tour of India. The 2013 season, however, found Trescothick averaging only in the mid-twenties, and failed to score a century for the first time since 1998. He remained, however, the second-highest run maker for Somerset, behind only <a href="Nick%20Compton">Nick Compton</a>,<ref name="Records / 2013 - Somerset / First-class matches / Most runs"></ref> and retained the captaincy for the 2014 season. He continued to appear as a commentator and analyst for <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> in the off-season, in particular during coverage of the <a href="2014%20World%20T20">2014 World T20</a>. He also publicly lent his support to England's <a href="Jonathan%20Trott">Jonathan Trott</a> during the latter's departure from the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Ashes%20series">2013–14 Ashes series</a>, empathising with Trott's stress-related illness in a statement to Sky Sports which recalled his own experiences, recalling that "you just can't take any more, you just can't get through the day let alone go out there and play a Test match and win a Test match."

Trescothick began the 2014 season strongly. He scored 112 in a warm-up game against Middlesex, followed by 95 against a university team. Subsequent scores of 20, 17 and five in the next three innings prompted George Dobell of ESPNcricinfo to comment that "Trescothick does not look anything like the batsman he once was," but he returned to form on 28 April with a further century against Sussex. It was his first in the County Championship since 2012, and was followed on 22 May with a second hundred, against Durham at Taunton. This century came 618 days after the last time he scored a hundred at his home ground. He passed 1,000 runs for the season on 25 September against Yorkshire, in the final game of the year's County Championship.

In 2015, Trescothick scored over 1,000 runs for the season, including three centuries and eight 50s, and completed the milestone yet again in July 2016 against Nottinghamshire.

In January 2016 after six seasons in the job Trescothick stood down from the Somerset captaincy to let experienced new overseas signing <a href="Chris%20Rogers%20%28cricketer%29">Chris Rogers</a> lead the team. Trescothick finished his first season without the captaincy since retiring from England duty with a season average of over 53 and also became the Somerset cricketer with the highest number of first class catches in the history of the club. He extended his contract with Somerset for the 2017 season during which he broke the record previously belonging to <a href="Harold%20Gimblett">Harold Gimblett</a> for most first class centuries for Somerset and signed another 12 month extension with Somerset in August 2017, to the end of the 2018 season, his 26th season with Somerset. On 25 September 2018 Trescothick took 3 consecutive slip catches as <a href="Craig%20Overton">Craig Overton</a> registered a hat trick in the county championship against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Notts</a>. It was only the third time in first class cricket history all three dismissals in a hat trick were caught by the same non wicket-keeping fielder. On the same day it was confirmed Trescothick had extended his contract for the 2019 season, his 27th at Somerset.

Rudolph Cartier

Rudolph Cartier (born Rudolph Kacser, renamed himself in Germany to Rudolph Katscher; 17 April 1904 – 7 June 1994) was an <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n <a href="television%20director">television director</a>, <a href="Filmmaking">filmmaker</a>, <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> and <a href="Film%20producer">producer</a> who worked predominantly in British television, exclusively for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. He is best known for his 1950s collaborations with screenwriter <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a>, most notably the "<a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Quatermass</a>" serials and <a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">their 1954 adaptation</a> of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <a href="utopian%20and%20dystopian%20fiction">dystopian novel</a> "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>".

After studying architecture and then drama, Cartier began his career as a screenwriter and then film director in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, working for <a href="Universum%20Film%20AG">UFA Studios</a>. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he began working for <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC Television</a> in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved in the making of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The Dead Eye was stopped in the production stage. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play "Loyalties" in 1976.

Active in both <a href="dramatic%20programming">dramatic programming</a> and <a href="opera">opera</a>, Cartier won the equivalent of a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">BAFTA</a> in 1957 for his work in the former, and one of his operatic productions was given an award at the 1962 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>. The <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s "<a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>" website describes him as "a true pioneer of television", while the critic Peter Black once wrote that: "Nobody was within a mile of Rudolph Cartier in the trick of making a picture on a TV screen seem as wide and as deep as <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a>."

Born in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> (now Austria), Cartier initially studied to become an architect, before changing career paths and enrolling to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. There he was taught by <a href="Max%20Reinhardt%20%28theatre%20director%29">Max Reinhardt</a>, who proved a major influence on Cartier. Reinhardt thought of a script as being similar to a <a href="Sheet%20music">musical score</a>, which should be interpreted by a director in the same way as a musician interpreting a piece of music—an approach with which Cartier agreed.

Cartier became involved in the <a href="film%20industry">film industry</a> in 1929, when he successfully submitted a script to a company based in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, Germany. He then became a staff scriptwriter for <a href="Universum%20Film%20AG">UFA Studios</a>, the primary German film company of the era, for which he worked on <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a>s and <a href="thriller%20%28genre%29">thrillers</a>. While at UFA, he worked with noted writers, directors and producers including <a href="Ewald%20Andr%C3%A9%20Dupont">Ewald André Dupont</a> and <a href="Erich%20Pommer">Erich Pommer</a>. In 1933 he became a <a href="film%20director">film director</a>, overseeing the thriller "Unsichtbare Gegner" for producer <a href="Sam%20Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a>.

The same year as "Unsichtbare Gegner" was released, the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a> came to power in Germany, and the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish Cartier left the country. Several members of Cartier's family who had remained in Europe, including his mother, later died in <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. Encouraged by a UFA colleague, <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>, to come to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, Cartier changed his surname and moved to the United States. However, unlike Wilder, Cartier did not find success in America, and in 1935 he moved again, to the United Kingdom.

Little further is recorded of Cartier's career until after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, when he began writing <a href="Plot%20%28narrative%29">storylines</a> for several minor <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British films</a>. He also worked as a <a href="film%20producer">film producer</a>, overseeing a 1951 <a href="short%20film">short film</a> adaptation of the <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> story "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Twisted%20Lip">The Man with the Twisted Lip</a>". Cartier returned for a time to the United States, where he studied production methods in the new medium of <a href="television">television</a>.

In 1952, <a href="Michael%20Barry%20%28television%20producer%29">Michael Barry</a>, with whom Cartier had worked on an aborted project in 1948, became the new Head of Drama at BBC Television and interviewed Cartier for a post as a staff television producer in the drama department, a job which also involved directing. At his interview, Cartier told Barry that he thought his department's output was "dreadful", and that television drama needed "new scripts and a new approach". In a 1990 interview about his career, he told <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>'s "<a href="The%20Late%20Show%20%28BBC2%20TV%20series%29">The Late Show</a>" that the BBC drama department had "needed me like water in the desert". Barry shared many of Cartier's views on the need to improve television drama, and he hired him for the producer's job.

Cartier's first BBC television production was a play entitled "<a href="Arrow%20to%20the%20Heart">Arrow to the Heart</a>", transmitted on the evening of 20 July 1952. It was initially adapted by Cartier from <a href="Albrecht%20Goes">Albrecht Goes</a>' novel "Unruhige Nacht", but Barry felt that the dialogue was "too Germanic" and assigned drama department staff scriptwriter <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a> to edit the script. "Arrow to the Heart" was the first of many collaborations between the pair, who enjoyed during the next few years a highly productive working relationship, despite profound creative disagreements on occasion. Cartier and Kneale were an important presence in the British television drama of the era and were, according to television historian Lez Cooke, "responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s".

Cartier and Kneale's first major production was the six-part serial "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>", broadcast in the summer of 1953. A <a href="science-fiction">science-fiction</a> story, it relates the sending of the first humans into space by <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a> and the consequences when an alien presence invades the crew's rocket during its flight and returns to Earth in the body of the one remaining crewmember, having absorbed the consciousnesses and shredded the bodies of the other two. A critical and popular success, "The Quatermass Experiment" has been described by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a> website as "one of the most influential series of the 1950s". Cartier's contribution to the serial's success was highlighted in his 1994 obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" newspaper, which also called the serial "a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb".

The success of "The Quatermass Experiment" led to two sequels, "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>" (1955) and "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>" (1958–59), both produced and directed by Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For "Quatermass II", he pre-filmed a significant amount of material <a href="filming%20location">on location</a>, using <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a>, opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.

The appeal of the "Quatermass" serials has been attributed by the <a href="Museum%20of%20Broadcast%20Communications">Museum of Broadcast Communications</a> to the depiction of "A new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security. As a result, or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier's effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama, audiences were captivated." The Screenonline website suggests that the visual impact of Cartier's interpretation of Kneale's scripts was a major factor in their success, which it attributes to their "originality, mass appeal and dynamism... "The Quatermass Experiment" became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television."

Aside from the "Quatermass" serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, including literary and theatrical adaptations of "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights">Wuthering Heights</a>" (6 December 1953) and "The Moment of Truth" (10 March 1955), as well as Kneale's own "The Creature" (30 January 1955). Of particular note was their collaboration on <a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">an adaptation</a> of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s novel "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>", originally broadcast on 12 December 1954, regarded as Cartier's most famous work. "The Times"'s review the day after its broadcast noted its "vividness... the <a href="Two%20Minutes%20Hate">two minutes' hate</a> was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness." The production also attracted considerable controversy. There were questions asked in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play, and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier's life if the second <a href="live%20television">live</a> performance, scheduled for 16 December, went ahead. The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards. Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the <a href="Board%20of%20Governors%20of%20the%20BBC">Board of Governors of the BBC</a> voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned. The production had by this time received the backing of the <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>, who commented during a speech to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> that he and <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Queen</a> had watched and enjoyed the first performance.

"Nineteen Eighty-Four" had been a success, but it was also one of the most expensive television dramas ever made in the UK. Cartier often spent large amounts of money on his productions. Earlier in 1954, Michael Barry had heavily criticised him for the money and resources he had expended in an adaptation of "<a href="Rebecca%20%28novel%29">Rebecca</a>". In a memo written after that production's transmission, Barry admonished Cartier for his over-ambitious production:

The performance of "Rebecca" seems to me to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by "Rebecca" on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon <a href="Extra%20%28actor%29">extras</a> and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.

Despite Barry's concerns, Cartier continued to work successfully in television, and at the <a href="Guild%20of%20Television%20Producers%20and%20Directors%20Awards%201957">1957 Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards</a> (later known as the <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">British Academy Television Awards</a>, or BAFTAs) he was the winner of the Drama category. He made a brief return to filmmaking in 1958 when he directed the feature "Passionate Summer", but he saw himself primarily as a television director, and it remained his favourite medium. "The essence of television is that you can control the viewer's response to a much greater extent than other media permit," he told "The Times" in 1958.

Cartier also directed several <a href="operas">operas</a> for the BBC, a genre for which he had a great passion. He oversaw adaptations of established operas such as "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>" (1962) as well as original productions written especially for television. "Tobias and the Angel", written for the BBC by <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Sir Arthur Bliss</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Hassall">Christopher Hassall</a> and produced by Cartier in 1960, won the Merit Award in the Salzburg Opera Prize at the 1962 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>.

Cartier continued to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry stepped down as Head of Drama in 1961, he lost much of his creative independence. Barry's successor, <a href="Sydney%20Newman">Sydney Newman</a>, abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as "<a href="Maigret">Maigret</a>" and "<a href="Z-Cars">Z-Cars</a>".

Cartier was still able to direct several notable productions during the decade, including a number which explored the Nazi era in Germany from which he had escaped in 1933. These included the World War II dramas "Cross of Iron" (1961, dealing with the <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a> of a <a href="U-Boat">U-Boat</a> captain in a British <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camp) and "The July Plot" (1964, about the <a href="July%2020%20Plot">1944 plot to assassinate Hitler</a>), as well as "Firebrand" (1967, about the 1933 <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a>, an event Cartier had personally witnessed). He also began, for the first time, to direct pieces which dealt with the Holocaust, such as "Doctor Korczak and the Children" ("<a href="Studio%204%20%28TV%20series%29">Studio 4</a>", 1962), concerning the <a href="Warsaw%20Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a> orphanage, and "The <a href="Joel%20Brand">Joel Brand</a> Story" (1965, about <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>'s 1944 offer to <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">the Allies</a> of the lives of 1 million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks). Other significant 1960s productions included adaptations of "<a href="Anna%20Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>" (1961, starring <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> and <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>) and "Wuthering Heights" (1962, a new version of Kneale's 1953 script, starring Bloom and <a href="Keith%20Michell">Keith Michell</a>). "Lee Oswald — Assassin" (1966) was a <a href="Docudrama">drama-documentary</a> telling the story of <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a>, based on the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a>'s findings, while "Conversation at Night" (1969) saw the first television acting appearance of <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>.

Cartier's career continued into the 1970s. In 1974, he directed episodes of "<a href="Fall%20of%20Eagles">Fall of Eagles</a>"; and his final credit came with the play "Loyalties", screened in 1976. By this time, he had worked on over 120 productions for the BBC. Subsequently, he worked for a time for the BBC's "purchased drama" department, advising on which plays and series might be bought-in from European broadcasters. Throughout his career, Cartier refused to work for <a href="commercial%20television">commercial television</a>: "I hate the idea of my creative work being constantly interrupted for commercial reasons, " he once commented. "I am an artist, not a salesman."

Cartier was married three times, lastly to Margaret Pepper from 1949 until his death. He had one daughter, Corinne, with Pepper, and another from a previous marriage. Cartier died on 7 June 1994, at the age of 90; his death was overshadowed in the media by that of <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>, another important figure in the history of British television drama, who died on the same day.

Nearly all of Cartier's 1950s television productions were performed <a href="live%20television">live</a>, and the majority of them were not recorded—he once described them as being "gone with the speed of light". Several of those which do survive have been highly regarded by later reviewers. In 2000, the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> (BFI) compiled a list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> of the 20th century. Voted on by a group of industry professionals, the list featured both "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "Quatermass and the Pit". In the accompanying analysis of each entry to the list, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" was described as "An early example of the power of television drama... Even now, the torture sequences retain their power to shock and disturb."

Nigel Kneale, scriptwriter of both of the Cartier dramas acclaimed by the BFI, felt that the productions would not have been as successful as they were had they been handled by any other director. "I don't think any of the things I wrote then would have come to anything much in other hands. In his they worked." Television historian Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in <a href="Film%20studies">film</a> and <a href="television%20studies">television studies</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Warwick">University of Warwick</a>, wrote in 2000 that Kneale and Cartier together created an entirely new, more expansive vision for British television drama in the 1950s.

It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly. Cartier is rightly recognised as a major influence on the visual development of British television drama... Cartier and Kneale had the ambition for their productions to affect a mass audience, and the scope of their attention was not confined to the 'cosy' aesthetics of intimacy. Cartier uses the <a href="close-up">close-up</a> both to reveal emotions and as a shock device: a more threatening—and perhaps exhilarating—method than was used before. 'Intimacy' is reformulated by Cartier in terms of his power and control over the viewer—no longer a part of the family, but isolated in his home.

Cartier's pioneering use of an increased number of pre-filmed sequences to open out the studio-bound, live television drama productions of the 1950s is also praised by Lez Cooke. "While film inserts were being used in television drama from the early 1950s, "Nineteen Eighty-Four" represented the most extensive use of them in a TV play up to that time, and signalled Cartier's determination to extend the boundaries of TV drama." Similarly, his "Times" obituary stated that: "At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension."

In addition to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier's later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of "Wuthering Heights" was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>" newspaper that the production "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The howl of the wind against the windows, the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work." While "Screenonline" states that "Lee Oswald—Assassin" (1966) "could be argued [to be] of historical interest only", due to its basis in the flawed <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a> report, "The Times" praised it as being "possibly the first drama-documentary".

Not all of Cartier's work was so well regarded; in particular, his cinematic efforts have not achieved the level of praise of his television work. In the book "America's Best, Britain's Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies", critic John Howard Reid says of Cartier's 1958 film "Passionate Summer": "It's hard to believe that... anyone could make such a dull movie. Yet this is precisely what director Rudolph Cartier has done. I've never heard of Mr Cartier before or since but presumably he made this brief foray into films from that synthetic world of ugly close-ups—TV."

Speaking to "The Times" in 1958, Cartier explained that television was still developing as a medium, and that part of his work was to help create the next generation of those who would produce television drama. "The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They are feeling their way towards what television drama will one day be, and we are trying to create a generation of writers who study the medium." His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper judged that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera "Carmen" as "an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers".

In 1990, the <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> <a href="The%20arts">arts</a> magazine programme "<a href="The%20Late%20Show%20%28BBC2%20TV%20series%29">The Late Show</a>" produced an edition which featured a retrospective of Cartier's work, including a new interview with the director discussing his career. A revised version of this feature was screened on BBC Two under the title "Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer" on 1 July 1994, followed by a tribute screening of the surviving <a href="telerecording">telerecording</a> copy of the second performance of "Nineteen Eighty-Four".

Chartwell

Chartwell is a <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a> near the town of <a href="Westerham">Westerham</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a> in <a href="South%20East%20England">South East England</a>. For over forty years it was the home of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against <a href="German%20re-armament">German re-armament</a> and the British government's response of <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a>; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During <a href="World%20War%20II">the Second World War</a> Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 election</a>. In 1953, when again <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Gate">28, Hyde Park Gate</a>, on 24 January 1965.

The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by <a href="John%20Campbell%20Colquhoun">John Campbell Colquhoun</a>, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an "imposing" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the <a href="High%20society%20%28social%20class%29">society</a> architect <a href="Philip%20Tilden">Philip Tilden</a>. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the <a href="Weald%20of%20Kent">Weald of Kent</a>, "the most beautiful and charming" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house.

In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by <a href="William%20Berry%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Camrose">Lord Camrose</a>, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, <a href="Clementine%20Churchill">Lady Churchill</a> surrendered her lease on the house and it was opened to the public by the Trust in 1966. A <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>, for its historical significance rather than its architectural merit, Chartwell has become among the Trust's most popular properties; some 232,000 people visited the house in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening.

The site had been built upon at least as early as the 16th century, when the estate was called Well Street. The origin of the name is the Chart Well, a spring to the north of the current house, Chart being an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word for rough ground. <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> was reputed to have stayed in the house during his courtship of <a href="Anne%20Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a> at nearby <a href="Hever%20Castle">Hever Castle</a>. Elements of the <a href="Tudor%20era">Tudor</a> house are still visible, the <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> listing for Chartwell notes that 16th (or possibly 17th) century brickwork can be seen in some of the external walls. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the house was used as a farmhouse and its ownership was subject to frequent change. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, a former MP; the Campbell Colquhouns were a family of Scottish landowners, lawyers and politicians. The original farmhouse was enlarged and modified during their ownership, including the addition of the stepped <a href="gable">gable</a>s, a <a href="Scottish%20baronial%20architecture">Scottish baronial</a> genuflection to the land of their fathers. By the time of the sale to Churchill, it was, in the words of Oliver Garnett, author of the 2008 guidebook to the house, an example of "Victorian architecture at its least attractive, a ponderous <a href="red%20brick">red-brick</a> country mansion of tile-hung gables and poky <a href="oriel%20window">oriel window</a>s".

Churchill first saw Chartwell in July 1921, shortly before the house and estate were to be auctioned. He returned the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500. He paid £5,000, after his first offer of £4,800, made because "the house will have to be very largely rebuilt, and the presence of dry rot is a very serious adverse factor", was rejected. The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow School</a> in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; "I am very glad indeed to have become the possessor of "Chartwell". I have been searching for two years for a home in the country and the site is the most beautiful and charming I have ever seen". The sale was concluded on 11 November 1922.

The previous 15 months had been personally and professionally calamitous. In June 1921, Churchill's <a href="Lady%20Randolph%20Churchill">mother</a> had died, followed three months later by his youngest child, Marigold. In late 1922, he fell ill with appendicitis and at the end of the year lost his Scottish parliamentary seat at <a href="Dundee%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Dundee</a>.

Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, began work on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a farmhouse near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, and a series of construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, "My beloved, I beg you not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our "home" (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years." Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you".

In February 1926, Churchill's political colleague <a href="Samuel%20Hoare%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Templewood">Sir Samuel Hoare</a> described a visit in a letter to the <a href="Media%20proprietor">press baron</a> <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a>; "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor, ... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a> stayed as a guest of Churchill's son <a href="Randolph%20Churchill">Randolph</a>. He described an evening after dinner; "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his "Chartwell Bulletins", which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; "<a href="Walter%20Sickert">Sickert</a> arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings ... I am really thrilled ... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".

Churchill described his life at Chartwell in the later 1930s in the first volume of his history of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, "The Gathering Storm". "I had much to amuse me. I built ... two cottages, ... and walls and made ... a large swimming pool which ... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I ... dwelt at peace within my habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. "He would start the day at eight o'clock in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent, ...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, "then" he would start work ... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate."
In the opinion of <a href="Robin%20Fedden">Robin Fedden</a>, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became "the most important country house in Europe". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a>. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own "little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was <a href="Maurice%20Hankey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hankey">Sir Maurice Hankey</a>, Clerk of the <a href="Privy%20council">Privy Council</a>, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, "I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament". A week later, <a href="Reginald%20Leeper">Reginald Leeper</a>, a senior <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> official and confident of <a href="Robert%20Vansittart%2C%201st%20Baron%20Vansittart">Robert Vansittart</a>, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, "there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late".

Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, <a href="Desmond%20Morton%20%28civil%20servant%29">Desmond Morton</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Wigram">Ralph Wigram</a>, information which he used to "form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for <a href="Surface-to-air%20missile">anti-aircraft shells</a>; "Such shells could be filled with <a href="Diethylzinc">zinc ethyl</a> which catches fire spontaneously ... A fraction of an ounce was demonstrated at Chartwell last summer".

In 1938, Churchill, beset by financial concerns, again considered selling Chartwell, at which time the house was advertised as containing five reception rooms, nineteen bed and dressing rooms, eight bathrooms, set in eighty acres with three cottages on the estate and a heated and floodlit swimming pool. He withdrew the sale after the industrialist <a href="Henry%20Strakosch">Henry Strakosch</a> agreed to take over his share portfolio, which had been hit heavily from losses on <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>, for three years and pay off significant associated debts.

Chartwell was mostly unused during the Second World War. Its exposed position in a county so near to <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">German occupied France</a>, meant that it was vulnerable to a German airstrike or commando raid. As a precaution the lakes were covered with brushwood to make the house less identifiable from the air. A rare visit to Chartwell occurred in July 1940, when Churchill inspected aircraft batteries in Kent. His pre-war writing assistant Eric Seal recorded the visit; "In the evening the PM, Mrs C and I went off to Chartwell. One of the features of the place is a whole series of ponds, which are stocked with immense goldfish. The PM loves feeding them". The Churchills instead spent their weekends at <a href="Ditchley">Ditchley House</a>, in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, until security improvements were completed at the Prime Minister's official country residence, <a href="Chequers">Chequers</a>, in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. At dinner at Chequers, in December 1940, <a href="Jock%20Colville">John Colville</a>, Churchill's <a href="Private%20Secretary">assistant private secretary</a> recorded his master's post-war plans, "He would retire to Chartwell and write a book on the war, which he had already mapped out in his mind chapter by chapter".
Chartwell remained a haven in times of acute stress – Churchill had spent the night there just before the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">fall of France</a> in 1940. Summoned back to London by an urgent plea from <a href="John%20Vereker%2C%206th%20Viscount%20Gort">Lord Gort</a> for permission to retreat to <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">Dunkirk</a>, Churchill broadcast the first of his wartime speeches to the nation; "Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour...for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation..." He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of <a href="Operation%20Battleaxe">Operation Battleaxe</a> to relieve <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Tobruk</a>, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">General Wavell</a>. <a href="Jock%20Colville">John Colville</a> recorded Churchill's deliberations in his diary; "spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple dressing gown and grey felt hat took me to see his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive". Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>, his secretary recorded that the house was "shut up and rather desolate".

After <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a>, the Churchills first returned to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to be greeted by what the horticulturalist and garden historian <a href="Stefan%20Buczacki">Stefan Buczacki</a> describes as, "the biggest crowd Westerham had ever seen". But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">June 1945 general election</a>. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return – "it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone". Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by <a href="William%20Berry%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Camrose">Lord Camrose</a>, raised the sum of £55,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for the sum of £43,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of £350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50-year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, at which point the property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, "I feel how inadequate my thanks have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years".
In the summer of 1953, Chartwell became Churchill's refuge once more when, again in office as Prime Minister, he suffered a massive <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. At the end of a dinner held on 23 June at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>, for the Italian Prime Minister <a href="Alcide%20De%20Gasperi">Alcide De Gasperi</a>, Churchill collapsed and was barely able either to stand or to speak. On the 25th, he was driven to Chartwell, where his condition deteriorated further. Churchill's doctor <a href="Baron%20Moran">Lord Moran</a> stated that, "he did not think the Prime Minister could possibly live over the weekend". That evening Colville summoned Churchill's closest friends in the press, Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Camrose and <a href="Brendan%20Bracken">Brendan Bracken</a> who, walking the lawns at Chartwell, agreed to try to ensure a press blackout to prevent any reporting of Churchill's condition. Colville described the outcome, "They achieved the all but incredible success of gagging <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a>, something they would have done for nobody but Churchill. Not a word of the Prime Minister's stroke was published until he casually mentioned it in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> a year later". Secluded and protected at Chartwell, Churchill made a remarkable recovery and thoughts of his retirement quickly receded. During his recuperation, Churchill took the opportunity to complete work on "Triumph and Tragedy", the sixth and final volume of his <a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">war memoirs</a>, which he had been forced to set aside when he returned to Downing Street in 1951.

Churchill's final departure from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cabinet</a>, almost fifty years since he had first sat in <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">the Cabinet Room</a> as <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a> in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, "It's always nice to be home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing <a href="bezique">bezique</a> or sitting "by the fish pond, feeding the <a href="Ide%20%28fish%29">golden orfe</a> and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, <a href="Mary%20Soames">Mary Soames</a>, recalled, "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating the view of the valley he had loved for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former <a href="principal%20private%20secretary">principal private secretary</a> Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, "It was sad to see such a great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> records Churchill was, "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.

The house has been restored and preserved as it looked in the 1920-30s; at the time of the Trust's purchase, Churchill committed to leave it, "garnished and furnished so as to be of interest to the public". Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, <a href="Grace%20Hamblin">Grace Hamblin</a>, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the <a href="Sutherland%27s%20Portrait%20of%20Winston%20Churchill">portrait of Churchill</a> painted by <a href="Graham%20Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a>. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.

The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by <a href="Philip%20Jebb">Philip Jebb</a>, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, <a href="Great%20Storm%20of%201987">the Great Storm</a> caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.

Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the "Churchill's Chartwell" Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, "for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values". The medal is displayed in the museum room on the first floor of Chartwell, at the opposite end of the house to the study, the room where, in the words used by <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> when awarding him <a href="honorary%20citizenship">honorary citizenship</a> of the United States, Churchill "mobilized the English language and sent it into battle".

The highest point of the estate is approximately 650 feet <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>, and the house commands views across the <a href="Weald">Weald</a> of Kent. The view from the house was of crucial importance to Churchill; years later, he remarked, "I bought Chartwell for that view."

Churchill employed the architect Philip Tilden, who worked from 1922 to 1924 to modernise and extend the house. Tilden was a "Society" architect who had previously worked for Churchill's friend <a href="Philip%20Sassoon">Philip Sassoon</a> at his Kent home, <a href="Port%20Lympne%20Mansion">Port Lympne</a>, and had designed <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">Lloyd George's</a> house, Bron-y-de, at <a href="Churt">Churt</a>. The architectural style is <a href="vernacular%20architecture">vernacular</a>. The house is constructed of red brick, of two storeys, with a basement and extensive attics. The 18th century doorcase in the centre of the entrance front was purchased from a London antiques dealer. The architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> considered it, "large and splendid and out of place". The garden wall on the Mapleton Road is modelled on that at <a href="Quebec%20House">Quebec House</a>, the home of <a href="James%20Wolfe">General Wolfe</a> in nearby Westerham.

On the garden front, Tilden threw up a large, three storey extension with stepped gables, called by Churchill "my promontory", which contains three of the house's most important rooms, the dining room, in the lower-storey basement, and the drawing room and Lady Churchill's bedroom above. 
The interior has been remodelled since the National Trust took over the property in 1966, to accommodate visitors and to enable the display of a large number of Churchillian artefacts. In particular, a number of guest bedrooms have been amalgamated, to allow the construction of the Museum room and the Uniform room. Nevertheless, the majority of the principal rooms have been reconstructed and furnished as they were in the 1920s–30s and are open to the public, with the current exception of Churchill's own bedroom.

Designed by Tilden, replacing a wood-panelled earlier hall, the halls lead onto the library, the drawing room and Lady Churchill's sitting room.

The bottom section of Tilden's "promontory" extension, the dining room contains the original suite of table and dining chairs designed by <a href="Heal%27s">Heal's</a> to Churchill's exacting requirements – (see box). An early study for a planned picture by <a href="William%20Nicholson%20%28artist%29">William Nicholson</a> entitled "Breakfast at Chartwell" hangs in the room. Nicholson, a frequent visitor to Chartwell who gave Churchill painting lessons, drew the study for a finished picture which was intended as a present for the Churchills' Silver Wedding anniversary in 1933 but, disliking the final version, Nicholson destroyed it. The picture depicts the Churchills breakfasting together, which in fact they rarely did, and Churchill's marmalade cat, Tango. The tradition of keeping a marmalade cat at Chartwell, which Churchill began and followed throughout his ownership, is maintained by the National Trust in accordance with Churchill's wishes. In a letter to Randolph written in May 1942, Churchill wrote of a brief visit to Chartwell the previous week, "the goose and the black swan have both fallen victim to the fox. The Yellow Cat however made me sensible of his continuing friendship, although I had not been there for eight months".

Above the dining room is the drawing room and, above that, Lady Churchill's bedroom, described by Churchill as "a magnificent aerial bower".

Churchill's study, on the first floor, was his "workshop for over 40 years" and "the heart of Chartwell".
In the 1920s, as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, he planned his budgets in the room; in the 1930s, in isolation, he composed his speeches that warned against the rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> and <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20as%20writer">dictated the books and articles</a> that paid the bills; in 1945, defeated, he retreated here to write his histories; and here, in final retirement, he passed much of his old age. Throughout the 1930s, the study was his base for the writing of many of his most successful books. His biography of his ancestor <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Marlborough</a> and his "<a href="The%20World%20Crisis">The World Crisis</a>" were written there, and "<a href="A%20History%20of%20the%20English-Speaking%20Peoples">A History of the English-Speaking Peoples</a>" was begun and concluded there, although interrupted by the Second World War. He also wrote many of his pre-war speeches in the study, although the house was less used during the war itself. Tilden exposed the early roof beams by removing the late-Victorian ceiling and inserted a Tudor doorcase. From the beams hang three banners, Churchill's <a href="Heraldic%20flag">standards</a> as <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> and <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Cinque%20Ports">Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</a> and the <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Flag</a> raised over <a href="Rome">Rome</a> on the night of 5 June 1944, the first British flag to fly over a liberated capital. The latter was a gift from <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Lord Alexander of Tunis</a>. The study also contains portraits of Churchill's parents, <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a> and <a href="Lady%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lady Randolph Churchill</a>, the latter by <a href="John%20Singer%20Sargent">John Singer Sargent</a>. The floor is covered with a <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorassan</a> carpet, a 69th birthday gift to Churchill from the <a href="Mohammad%20Reza%20Pahlavi">Shah of Iran</a> at the <a href="Teheran%20Conference">Teheran Conference</a> in 1943.

Beyond the study are Churchill's bedroom and his ensuite bathroom, with sunken bath. At the time of the house's opening to the public in 1966, these rooms were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill's family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill's daughter Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans to make them accessible by 2020.

Neither the original Victorian house with its extensions, nor Tilden's reconstruction, created a building that has been highly regarded by critics. John Newman noted that the massing of the house on the garden terraces, taking advantage of the Wealden views, was "the grouping that mattered". He dismissed the other side of the house as a, "long, indecisive entrance front close to the road" and the overall composition as of "dull red brick and an odd undecided style". The architectural writer and Chairman of the National Trust <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> considered the house, "undistinguished". The National Trust's guidebook describes the original building as "Victorian architecture at its least attractive". The house is <a href="listed%20building">Grade I listed</a> but its brief, Historic England listing makes clear that this is "for historical reasons" rather than for its architectural quality. The gardens are <a href="listed%20building">Grade II* listed</a>.

The gardens surrounding the house comprise , with a further of parkland. They are predominantly the creation of Churchill and Lady Churchill, with significant later input from <a href="Lanning%20Roper">Lanning Roper</a>, Gardens Adviser to the National Trust.
The Victorian garden had been planted with <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a> and <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>s which were typical of the period. The Churchills removed much of this planting, while retaining the woodlands beyond. Within the garden proper, they created almost all of the landscape, architectural and water features seen today. The garden front of the house opens onto a terraced lawn, originally separated from the garden beyond by a <a href="ha-ha">ha-ha</a> and subsequently by a <a href="Kentish%20ragstone">Kentish ragstone</a> wall constructed in the 1950s. To the north lies the Rose garden, laid out by Lady Churchill and her cousin, <a href="Venetia%20Stanley%20%281887%E2%80%931948%29">Venetia Stanley</a>. The nearby Marlborough Pavilion was built by Tilden and decorated with frescos by Churchill's nephew, <a href="John%20Spencer-Churchill%20%28artist%29">John Spencer Churchill</a> in 1949. Beyond the Rose Garden is the Water Garden, constructed by the Churchills and including the Golden Orfe pond where Churchill fed his fish, and the swimming pool constructed in the 1930s. Churchill sought advice from his friend and scientific <a href="guru">guru</a> <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Professor Lindemann</a> on the optimal methods for heating and cleaning the pool.

To the south, is the <a href="Croquet">Croquet</a> lawn, previously a tennis court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn are a number of structures grouped around the Victorian <a href="kitchen%20garden">kitchen garden</a>, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the <a href="Amalgamated%20Union%20of%20Building%20Trade%20Workers">Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers</a>, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a <a href="Wedding%20anniversary">Golden Wedding</a> anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.

South of the terrace lawn are the Upper and Lower lakes, scene of Churchill's most ambitious landscaping schemes. The Lower lake had existed during the Colquhouns' ownership, but the island within it, and the Upper lake, were Churchill's own creations. On 1 January 1935, while Lady Churchill was on a cruise off <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, Churchill described the beginnings of his endeavours in one of his Chartwell Bulletins; "I have arranged to have one of those great mechanical diggers. In one week he can do more than 40 men can do. There is no difficulty about bringing him in as he is a caterpillar and can walk over the most sloppy fields". Excavation work proved more challenging than Churchill had anticipated, two weeks later he wrote again, "The mechanical digger has arrived. He moves about on his caterpillars only with the greatest difficulty on this wet ground".

On the lakes lived Churchill's large collection of wildfowl, including the <a href="black%20swan">black swan</a>s, a gift from the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian Government</a>, which restocked the lakes with them in 1975.

In 1946–47, Churchill extended his land-holdings around Chartwell, purchasing Chartwell Farm and Parkside Farm, and subsequently Bardogs Farm and a market garden. By 1948, he was farming approximately 500 acres. The farms were managed by Mary Soames's husband, <a href="Christopher%20Soames">Christopher</a> and Churchill kept cattle and pigs and also grew crops and market vegetables. The farms did not prove profitable, however, and by 1952, Churchill's operating losses on them exceeded £10,000 a year. By the end of the decade, the farms and the livestock had been sold. A somewhat more lucrative venture was the owning, and later breeding, of racehorses. In 1949, Churchill had purchased Colonist II, which won its first race, the Upavon Stakes, at <a href="Salisbury%20Racecourse">Salisbury</a> that year, and subsequently netted Churchill some £13,000 in winnings. In 1955 Churchill bought the Newchapel Stud and by 1961 his total prize money from racing exceeded £70,000. In the 1950s, he reflected on his racing career; "Perhaps <a href="Divine%20providence">Providence</a> had given him Colonist as a comfort in his old age and to console him for disappointments".

Florida Atlantic University

Florida Atlantic University (FAU or Florida Atlantic) is a <a href="public%20university">public university</a> in <a href="Boca%20Raton%2C%20Florida">Boca Raton</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, with five satellite campuses in the Florida cities of <a href="Dania%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Dania Beach</a>, <a href="Davie%2C%20Florida">Davie</a>, <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale</a>, <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter</a>, and in <a href="Fort%20Pierce%2C%20Florida">Fort Pierce</a> at the <a href="Harbor%20Branch%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution</a>. FAU belongs to the 12-campus <a href="State%20University%20System%20of%20Florida">State University System of Florida</a> and serves South Florida, which has more than five million people and spans more than 100 miles (160 km) of coastline. Florida Atlantic University is classified by the <a href="The%20Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching">Carnegie Foundation</a> as a research university with high research activity. The university offers more than 170 undergraduate and graduate degree programs within its 10 colleges. Programs of study cover <a href="arts">arts</a> and <a href="humanities">humanities</a>, the <a href="science">science</a>s, <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="nursing">nursing</a>, <a href="accounting">accounting</a>, <a href="business">business</a>, <a href="education">education</a>, <a href="public%20administration">public administration</a>, <a href="social%20work">social work</a>, <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="engineering">engineering</a>, and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>.

Florida Atlantic opened in 1964 as the first public university in <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">southeast Florida</a>, offering only upper-division and graduate level courses. Initial enrollment was only 867 students, increasing in 1984 when the university admitted its first lower-division undergraduate students. , enrollment has grown to over 30,000 students representing 140 countries, 50 <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a>, and the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">District of Columbia</a>. Since its inception, Florida Atlantic has awarded more than 110,000 degrees to nearly 153,160 alumni.

In recent years, FAU has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional university. The university has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions. Changes include an on-campus stadium, additional on-campus housing, and the establishment of a College of Medicine in 2010.

On July 15, 1961, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on <a href="Boca%20Raton%20Army%20Airfield">Boca Raton Army Airfield</a>, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a>' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing <a href="Boca%20Raton%20Airport">Boca Raton Airport</a> and on 5,860 acres (23.7 km²) of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from <a href="Japanese-American">Japanese-American</a> farmers from the failing <a href="Yamato%20Colony%2C%20Florida">Yamato Colony</a>. The land was seized through <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a>, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.
The airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. The airfield was composed of four runways, still visible on the Boca Campus today and mainly used for parking.

By early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to <a href="Keesler%20Air%20Force%20Base">Keesler Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned.

Florida Atlantic University opened on September 14, 1964, with an initial student body of 867 students in five colleges. The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> on October 25, 1964, at the dedication and opening of the university. At the time of its opening, there were 120 faculty out of a total of 350 employees. On-campus housing for students was first added in September 1965, when Algonquin Hall opened.

Florida Atlantic's history is one of continuing expansion as the university's service population has grown. The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution "to complement the state's community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions."

Florida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a>. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic opened its doors to lower-division undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus, in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.

In 1989, the <a href="Florida%20Legislature">Florida Legislature</a> recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in <a href="Dania%20Beach">Dania Beach</a> in 1997 and another campus in the City of <a href="Davie%2C%20Florida">Davie</a> in western <a href="Broward%20County">Broward County</a> in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in <a href="Port%20St.%20Lucie%2C%20Florida">Port St. Lucie</a> in 1994 to establish a campus on the <a href="Treasure%20Coast">Treasure Coast</a>. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter</a> Campus, named for the late <a href="John%20D.%20MacArthur">John D. MacArthur</a>. This campus houses the university's honors college.

Florida Atlantic University and the <a href="University%20of%20Miami">University of Miami</a>'s <a href="Miller%20School%20of%20Medicine">Miller School of Medicine</a> established a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">medical training</a> program within the <a href="Charles%20E.%20Schmidt%20College%20of%20Biomedical%20Science">Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science</a> in 2004. Plans originally called for the construction of a new <a href="teaching%20hospital">teaching hospital</a> in coordination with <a href="Boca%20Raton%20Community%20Hospital">Boca Raton Community Hospital</a> on the main campus. Following successive budgets deficits in 2007, the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely. However, Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010. The <a href="Harbor%20Branch%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution</a> (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic's seventh campus.

The university also offers upper-division undergraduate and graduate student housing in the Business and Professional Women's Scholarship House for women with a strong academic background.

One of the newest residences on the Boca Raton campus is the Innovation Village Apartments (IVA), consisting of two buildings: IVA North and IVA South. It is a 1,200-bed apartment-style housing facility for upperclassmen, graduate, and medical students. It offers amenities that one would find in a high-rise apartment complex: lounges, retail dining, fitness centers, a pool/cabana, a volleyball court, common areas, and more. The facility opened in fall 2011. FAU's newest residence hall is Parliament Hall, a lakeside freshmen housing facility offering 614 beds, a fitness center, lounges, retail dining, and views of the nearby Atlantic Ocean from top floors.

Within its existing residential life programs, Florida Atlantic offers a number of Learning Communities for freshmen and students with similar interests and concentrations. Participants meet people with similar interests, live on the same floor and take courses with others in their community, while receiving additional guidance related to those interests. The university's Learning Community programs are divided into two categories, Freshman Learning Communities and Living Learning Communities. The freshman program offers 16 different concentrations, including business, nursing, and education. The Living program offers six concentrations for students residing in the Heritage Park Towers <a href="dormitory">dormitory</a>, including engineering, computer science, and a Women's Leadership program.

The university's Department of Housing and Residential Life and the university's fraternities and sororities sponsor a program for <a href="freshman">freshmen</a> and other students returning to Florida Atlantic in the fall semester. This program, called the "Weeks of Welcome", spans 11 days and all campuses, and works to acclimate students with university life and to build a good on-campus community. On each day, a number of different events are scheduled, including Hall Wars, which are athletic competitions between dormitories, <a href="Luau">Luau</a>s, and a number of other events. The Weeks of Welcome is the second largest campus-wide event held by Florida Atlantic.

For the 2010–2011 academic year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300 registered student organizations. Among the groups are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from <a href="sailing">sailing</a> to <a href="Ultimate%20Frisbee">Ultimate Frisbee</a>, from varsity and club sports and a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> group to a <a href="pottery">pottery</a> <a href="guild">guild</a>, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9 million that is then given to <a href="student%20government%23United%20States">student government</a> for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the "<a href="University%20Press%20%28Florida%20Atlantic%20University%29">University Press</a>", OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.
Florida Atlantic's <a href="homecoming">homecoming</a>, also known as the "Owl Prowl," is celebrated annually in the fall semester. Events occur mainly on the Boca Raton Campus, but a number of other campuses host their own events as well. In the past, homecoming has had kickoff parties, costumed dances, <a href="bonfires">bonfires</a>, comedy shows, alumni events and dinners, a golf cart parade, and <a href="tailgating">tailgating</a>. Florida Atlantic students have an organized football tailgating area known as the Rat's Mouth. The name references the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> translation of <a href="Boca%20Raton">Boca Raton</a>.

Florida Atlantic completed an $18.6 million Recreation and Wellness Center in spring 2010. The facility houses an outdoor leisure and lap pool, a cardio equipment and free weight room, two multipurpose rooms, three indoor courts and health club-style locker rooms. In 2011, the facility won the NIRSA Outstanding Sports Facilities Award. Other recreation facilities include a $4.2 million track and field complex, with synthetic turf (opened January 2007), a ropes challenge course and the 6.5 acre Henderson Fields, utilized most often by the FAU Intramural Sports and Club Sports programs.

Florida Atlantic is home to approximately 28 chapters of national <a href="fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternities and sororities</a>, encompassing approximately 1,077 members or 5% of the undergraduate population. The highpoint of Greek life at Florida Atlantic is "Greek Week." This event is held annually during the spring semester and showcases a number of themed competitions between the university's Greek organizations. There are currently no on-campus Greek houses. However, a Greek Life Housing <a href="task%20force">task force</a> has been formed to explore various housing models, including the cost of construction, "and make recommendations on how to improve the overall quality of the Greek housing..."

Florida Atlantic University has awarded more than 110,000 degrees to nearly 105,000 alumni worldwide since its opening. Some notable Florida Atlantic alumni are:

Final Fantasy XII

The game takes place in the <a href="fictional%20location">fictional land</a> of <a href="Ivalice">Ivalice</a>, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Dalmasca is annexed by Archadia, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of becoming a <a href="sky%20pirate">sky pirate</a> in command of an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

"Final Fantasy XII" received critical acclaim, earning numerous <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> awards. As of November 2009, the game sold over six million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2. A sequel, "", was released for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> in 2007. A high-definition remaster of the "International Zodiac Job System" version, subtitled "The Zodiac Age", was released for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>.

Throughout the game, the player directly controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only see from the perspective of Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of "Final Fantasy XII" is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier "Final Fantasy" games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the <a href="overworld">overworld</a> on foot, <a href="Chocobo">Chocobo</a>, or by airship. Players may save their game to a <a href="memory%20card">memory card</a> using save <a href="crystals">crystals</a> or gate crystals, and may use the latter to <a href="Teleportation">teleport</a> between gate crystals. An in-game <a href="bestiary">bestiary</a> provides incidental information about the world of "Final Fantasy XII".

"Final Fantasy XII" restructures the system of earning gil, the currency of the "Final Fantasy" games; instead of gil, most enemies drop "loot" which can be sold at shops. This ties into a new battle mechanic which rewards the player with improved loot for slaying a particular type of enemy multiple times in a row. Selling different types of loot also unlocks a bazaar option in shops, which provides items at a lower cost, or items exclusive to the bazaar.

Excluding the <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XI">Final Fantasy XI</a>", "Final Fantasy XII" is the first entry in the main "Final Fantasy" series not to include <a href="random%20encounter">random encounter</a>s. Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld and the player may choose to fight or avoid them. Battles unfold in real time using the "Active Dimension Battle" (ADB) system. Battles begin when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy, the party attacks an enemy, or a story event initiates a confrontation. When a character or enemy begins an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the different types of action. The player may swap to and issue commands to any of the three characters in the party, but guest characters are controlled by <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Battle commands are initiated through a series of menus, and include Attack, Magicks, Technicks, Mist, Gambits, and Items. The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted.

A new feature in "Final Fantasy XII" is the "gambit" system, which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions. Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target "Ally: HP < 70%" causes the character to target any ally whose <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">hit points</a> have fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered. These heuristics guide the characters when acting autonomously, though player-directed commands are always given top priority.

In "Final Fantasy XII", a mysterious phenomenon known as "Mist" is the key energy which allows characters to <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20classes%23Summoner">cast summoning magic</a> and perform "Quickenings". After defeating an Esper in combat, the player will be able to summon it to the battlefield. Similar to "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", the summoned creatures become active participants in battle, as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike "Final Fantasy X", however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player's direct command. The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights. An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out, its time limit expires, or it executes its special attack. Some Espers have origins in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics%20Advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a>" and others are derived from the final bosses of previous "Final Fantasy" games such as <a href="Chaos%20%28Final%20Fantasy%20character%29">Chaos</a>, the final boss of the first "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20%28video%20game%29">Final Fantasy</a>", and Zeromus, the final boss of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IV">Final Fantasy IV</a>".

"Final Fantasy XII" introduces "Quickenings", a new <a href="Limit%20Break">Limit Break</a> system unique compared to those in previous games in the series. Characters learn Quickenings by progressing to specific panels on the License Board. Each character can learn three Quickenings, which are unique to that character. Characters may string together Quickenings into large combo attacks, called Mist Chains, via timed button presses. If a Mist Chain reaches a certain length, a final strike will be initiated at the end of the Quickening cycle, called a Concurrence.

As in many role-playing games (RPGs), characters "<a href="Levels%20up">level up</a>" each time they earn a set number of <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's <a href="statistic%20%28role-playing%20games%29">statistics</a> and improves performance in battle. Statistics include <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">hit points</a>, the amount of damage a character can receive; strength, the power of the character's physical attacks; and magic, the potency of the character's magical spells.

In addition to leveling up, players may improve their characters via the License Board. The License Board is an array of panels that contain "licenses" which allow a character to perform certain actions. The board is split into two parts; the upper part comprises Magick, Technick, Accessory, and Augment (<a href="Attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">stat increases</a> and other permanent <a href="buff%20%28computer%20gaming%29">buffs</a>) licenses, and the bottom part comprises mostly Weapon and Armor licenses. To use a <a href="Skill%20%28role-playing%20games%29">Magick, Technick</a>, or piece of equipment, the character must obtain its corresponding license by spending the required amount of LP (License Points). LP are earned in battle along with the experience points. Like the <a href="Sphere%20Grid">Sphere Grid</a> in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", all characters may obtain all licenses on the board; however, each Quickening and Esper license may only be activated by a single character. 

"Final Fantasy XII" is set within the land of <a href="Ivalice">Ivalice</a> during an age when "magic was commonplace" and "airships plied the skies, crowding out the heavens". At this time, magicite, a magic-rich mineral, is commonly used in magic spells and in powering airships—a popular form of transportation in Ivalice. Ivalice is divided into three continents: Ordalia, Valendia, and Kerwon. Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice. The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of this continent as the eastern portion of it is largely desert and "jagd"—lawless regions so rich in Mist, the ethereal manifestation of magicite, that airships cannot function. Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia, where lush highlands dot the landscape. Central to the story is Dalmasca, a small kingdom between the two continents and empires. Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia, Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert. The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon to the south and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia. During this time, Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia. Caught between the two powerful Empires, Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins.

The six main playable characters in "Final Fantasy XII" are <a href="Vaan">Vaan</a>, an energetic orphan of Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a <a href="sky%20pirate">sky pirate</a>; <a href="Ashelia%20B%27nargin%20Dalmasca">Ashe</a>, a determined princess of Dalmasca who lost her father and her husband in the Archadian invasion; <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20XII%23Basch">Basch</a>, a disgraced knight of Dalmasca charged with <a href="treason">treason</a> for slaying the king; <a href="Balthier">Balthier</a>, a gentlemanly sky pirate who pilots his airship, the "Strahl"; <a href="Fran%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Fran</a>, Balthier's partner and a Viera exile whose knowledge extends to legends and myths; and <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20XII%23Penelo">Penelo</a>, Vaan's childhood friend who accompanies him on journeys to "keep an eye on him".

The Archadian Empire is ruled by House Solidor, headed by Emperor Gramis. The emperor's sons are Vayne and Larsa, the former a military genius and the game's main antagonist, and the latter a charismatic seeker of peace. Judge Magisters, upholders of Archadian law, protect House Solidor and execute every command issued by the ruling family. The technological marvels of airships and synthetic nethicite—a form of magicite that absorbs Mist—are thanks to Doctor Cid, a prominent researcher from Archadia. The Resistance against Archadia includes Dalmascan knight Vossler, an ally of Basch; <a href="Marquis">Marquis</a> Halim Ondore IV, the game's <a href="narrator">narrator</a> and ruler of the skycity Bhujerba; Reddas, a sky pirate based in the port at Balfonheim; and the Rozarrian Empire, of which Al-Cid Margrace is a prince of the ruling family. The mythos of "Final Fantasy XII" revolves around a character known as Dynast-King Raithwall, a man who once united Ivalice to create the Galtean Alliance in ages past.

In Dalmasca's capital city of Rabanastre, Princess Ashelia (Ashe) of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia have just wed, as the Archadian Empire invades the two countries. Rasler is killed in the war, the city of Nabudis is destroyed in a single explosion, and the Dalmascan King Raminas is assassinated moments after signing a treaty of surrender. Marquis Ondore announces that the assassin was Dalmascan captain Basch, who has been sentenced to death, and that Princess Ashe has committed suicide.

Two years later, Vaan, a Rabanastre <a href="Street%20children">street urchin</a>, ignores his friend Penelo's objections and infiltrates the palace during a dinner celebrating the appointment of Archadian prince Vayne Solidor as <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a>. In the treasury he finds a piece of magicite, a powerful magical crystal. He is discovered by Balthier and Fran, a pair of sky pirates looking for the magicite. The three escape as Dalmascan Resistance forces assault the palace, and in the sewers they meet the Resistance leader, Amalia, before being captured by Archadian forces. Detained in the Nalbina dungeons, they meet Basch, who was imprisoned but not killed, and who states his twin brother Gabranth was the one to kill the king. The four then escape together back to Rabanastre. There they discover Penelo has been kidnapped and taken to the floating city of Bhujerba by the bounty hunter Ba'Gamnan, who seeks to draw Balthier to him.

In Bhujerba, they meet Lamont, a curious boy who is Vayne's younger brother, Larsa, in disguise. After rescuing Penelo from the Lhusu Mines, Larsa invites her to stay with him. Basch confronts the Marquis over his lies, but the party is captured and detained aboard the Archadian <a href="airship">airship</a> "Leviathan", headed by Judge Ghis. On the "Leviathan", the party is reunited with Penelo and Amalia, who is revealed to be Princess Ashe. Ghis takes the magicite, which is revealed to be a royal Dalmascan artifact, "deifacted nethicite", from Vaan to send to Archadia. The party escapes the airship, but as Ashe had planned to use the magicite as proof that she was the princess, the group makes plans to collect another of the pieces of nethicite, the Dawn Shard. They do so, but are again captured by Ghis; when he tries to use the Dawn Shard in the "Leviathan" rather than the "manufacted" (artificially made) magicite it normally uses, his entire airship fleet is destroyed in a mirror of the destruction of Nabudis, and the party flees again.

The party encounters Larsa, who seeks a peace treaty between Dalmasca and the empire. Convinced, Ashe and the group go to Mt. Bur-Omisace to seek the Gran Kiltias Anastasis, Ivalice's religious leader, and beg his approval of her as queen of Dalmasca. There, they also meet Al-Cid Margrace, a member of the Rozarrian Empire ruling family, who is seeking to avert a war between Rozarria and Archadia and is in talks with Larsa. Their plans are curtailed when Anastasis is killed by Archadia, and soon afterwards the Archadian emperor Gramis dies and Vayne ascends the throne.

After retrieving the Sword of Kings, which can destroy nethicite, the party journeys to Archadia to retrieve Larsa, who has been taken. There they discover Doctor Cid, who created manufacted magicite, and who directs them to go to Giruvegan as it is the source of nethicite. In Giruvegan, only Ashe can enter the final area, where she encounters the makers of nethicite, the immortal Occuria, who "pull the strings of history"; they give her the Treaty Blade to cut new pieces of nethicite from the Sun-cryst, the source of all nethicite and its power. She learns that Venat, one of the Occuria, has defected to put the "reins of History back in the hands of Man", controlling Vayne and Cid, manipulating the former's goal to conquer Ivalice and become the new Dynast King, and leading the latter to create manufacted magicite to reduce the relative power of the Occuria. Archadia's expansion campaign was a front to capture the existing shards of nethicite.

Ashe and the party journey to Pharos tower, the location of the Sun-cryst, where she decides not to take her revenge by following the Occuria's wishes, but instead destroy the Sun-cryst. The party defeats Gabranth, who reveals that he killed King Raminas, and then the party also defeats Cid, before destroying the crystal. The group later learns from Al-Cid that the Dalmascan Resistance, led by Ondore, is about to fight Archadia in Rabanastre, but the Archadian forces now include the Sky Fortress "Bahamut", powered by the Mist released by the destruction of the Sun-Cryst. They infiltrate the "Bahamut", and find Larsa attempting to dissuade his brother Vayne from his plans for war to no avail. They defeat Vayne and Venat, and Ashe and Larsa announce the end of the conflict to the battlefield. Larsa becomes the Archadian emperor and Ashe the Queen of Dalmasca; Basch replaces his brother Gabranth as Larsa's protector; Vaan and Penelo fly an airship to meet Balthier and Fran for another adventure.

Development for "Final Fantasy XII" began in December 2000 and was headed by "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>" director <a href="Yasumi%20Matsuno">Yasumi Matsuno</a> and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IX">Final Fantasy IX</a>" director <a href="Hiroyuki%20Ito">Hiroyuki Ito</a>. Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but was forced to bow out of his roles midway through production due to health concerns. The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and <a href="Hiroshi%20Minagawa">Hiroshi Minagawa</a>, while <a href="Akitoshi%20Kawazu">Akitoshi Kawazu</a> of "<a href="SaGa%20%28series%29">SaGa</a>" series fame became the game's executive producer. Series creator <a href="Hironobu%20Sakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> was disappointed by Matsuno's departure and declined to play the game beyond its introduction.

The desire to move away from <a href="random%20encounter">random encounter</a>s was present since the beginning of development. This desire fueled the development of the Active Dimension Battle system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this change. Battle system designer Hiroshi Tomomatsu states that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in the final version of the game. Ito drew inspiration for gambits from <a href="play%20from%20scrimmage">plays</a> in <a href="American%20football">American football</a> where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions and desired outcome. As for the license system, he explained that needing "licenses" to perform certain actions was a natural extension of the rigid structured society of Archadia, as epitomized by its Judges.

At the early stages of development, Minagawa revealed that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.

Design inspiration came from a mix of medieval <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> countries as demonstrated by the architectural styles found throughout Ivalice along with many of the races populating the region. The art team, led by art directors Hideo Minaba and Isamu Kamikokuryō, visited <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, which influenced the game's Mediterranean-style setting. The developers also used styles and deco from other sources including areas in <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Of note is the use of <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> in the city of Bhujerba. Phrases such as "svagatam" (welcome) and titles like "parijanah" (guide) are lifted directly from Sanskrit. Minaba mentions that the team tried to bring out <a href="Arab%20culture">Arabic culture</a> in the design of the game. <a href="War">War</a> is a prominent theme of the game and the developers stated that the cutscene battles are influenced by <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. When asked to comment on the fan observation of "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" similarities, Minaba replied that although he was a fan of the series, it was not necessarily an influence to the game's designs. It has also been noted that the similarities originate from "<a href="The%20Hidden%20Fortress">The Hidden Fortress</a>", the 1958 <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> film that inspired "Star Wars".

Basch was initially meant to be the main protagonist of the story, but the focus was eventually shifted to Vaan and Penelo when the two characters were created later in development. The development team explained that their previous game, "<a href="Vagrant%20Story">Vagrant Story</a>", which featured a "strong man in his prime" as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding "Final Fantasy XII" from a "big and tough" protagonist to a younger, youthful one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. With the casting of actor <a href="Kouhei%20Takeda">Kouhei Takeda</a> for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan became less feminine and more "active, upbeat bright and positive". Comments were made about the similarity between main character designer and background design supervisor <a href="Akihiko%20Yoshida">Akihiko Yoshida</a>'s creations and those of <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, another Square Enix character designer. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. The designers stated that non-human characters and races feature a prominent role in the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers.

Miwa Shoda wrote a storyline for the game premised on the basis of the cutscenes and world setting that had already been finished when she joined the team. Scenario writer <a href="Daisuke%20Watanabe">Daisuke Watanabe</a> in turn fleshed out Shoda's plot into a script. During the English localization process, <a href="Alexander%20O.%20Smith">Alexander O. Smith</a>, who had previously worked on "<a href="Vagrant%20Story">Vagrant Story</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", acted as producer and translator. While still preserving the meaning behind the Japanese script, Smith made the decision to use different <a href="list%20of%20dialects%20of%20the%20English%20language">dialects of English</a> to reproduce the <a href="Japanese%20dialects">regional differences</a> in pronunciation found in the Japanese version. He also tried to distance the game from the "flat reads" found in other dubbed work by casting voice actors who had experience in theatre work. In terms of general changes, the localization team introduced <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> 16:9 ratio support and reinserted scenes that were left out of the original Japanese version for political reasons and to preserve an "All Ages" <a href="Computer%20Entertainment%20Rating%20Organization">CERO</a> rating.

On November 15, 2005, a <a href="game%20demo">playable demo</a> of the game was shipped with the North American release of "<a href="Dragon%20Quest%20VIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a>". To commemorate the release of "Final Fantasy XII", playable demos of the English version were available at DigitalLife's Gaming Pavilion in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on October 11, 2006, a day dubbed ""Final Fantasy XII" Gamer's Day". Additionally, Square Enix gave fans the chance to <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> as characters from "Final Fantasy XII". Each person was asked to show Square Enix three photos of his or her costume for a chance to win a trip to New York and participate in the "Final Fantasy XII" Gamer's Day event.

"Final Fantasy XII" once held the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> for longest development period in a <a href="video%20game">video game</a> production, with a total of five years, spanning from 2001 until its release in 2006. At a "Final Fantasy XII" "postmortem" at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> in March 2009, Hiroshi Minagawa mentioned that several years of production were devoted to the creation of custom tools used for the development of the game. It was also listed as 8th on the Guinness top 50 games of all time in 2009.

<a href="Hitoshi%20Sakimoto">Hitoshi Sakimoto</a> composed and arranged most of the game's soundtrack, with <a href="Hayato%20Matsuo">Hayato Matsuo</a> and <a href="Masaharu%20Iwata">Masaharu Iwata</a> creating seven and two tracks respectively. <a href="Nobuo%20Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, following his departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the ending song, "<a href="Kiss%20Me%20Good-Bye%20%28Angela%20Aki%20song%29">Kiss Me Good-Bye</a>". Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way. "Kiss Me Good-Bye" was performed in both English and Japanese by <a href="Angela%20Aki">Angela Aki</a>. Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing reminded Uematsu of his childhood idol, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, which was one of the reasons he chose her. The English version of the song was featured in both the Japanese and North American versions of the game. In addition to the theme song, violinist <a href="Taro%20Hakase">Taro Hakase</a> co-composed, arranged, and performed the game's ending credits theme, "Symphonic Poem "Hope"", along with Yuji Toriyama.

Two promotional soundtracks were released before the original soundtrack, "Symphonic Poem "Hope"" and "The Best of the Final Fantasy XII Soundtrack", on March 1 and 15, 2006, respectively. The former contains all the music used in the game's trailer performed by Taro Hakase, including "Symphonic Poem "Hope"". The original soundtrack itself was released in Japan on May 31, 2006. It consists of 4 CDs with 100 tracks, and includes promotional tracks not in the final version of the game. The CD single for "Kiss Me Good-Bye" was released on the March 15, 2006. A limited edition was also released, featuring a DVD containing the music video for "Kiss Me Good-Bye". <a href="Tofu%20Records">Tofu Records</a> has released an abridged version of the original soundtrack, which contains 31 songs, including "Kiss Me Good-Bye".

"Final Fantasy XII" sold more than 1,764,000 copies in its first week in Japan, almost equaling the sales of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>" in its first week. A Square Enix conference report stated that "Final Fantasy XII" sold more than 2.38 million copies in Japan in the two weeks since its March 16, 2006 release. In North America, "Final Fantasy XII" shipped approximately 1.5 million copies in its first week. It was the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of 2006 worldwide. As of March 2007, the game had shipped over 5.2 million copies worldwide. By November 2009, over 6 million copies of the game were sold worldwide on PlayStation 2. As of October 2017, The PlayStation 4 remaster shipped over one million copies worldwide.

According to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, "Final Fantasy XII" received "universal acclaim". On March 16, 2006, it became the sixth game to receive a perfect score from the Japanese gaming magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>", making it the first "Final Fantasy" game, first <a href="Hiroyuki%20Ito">Hiroyuki Ito</a> game, and only PlayStation 2 game to do so. It is also the second Yasumi Matsuno game to garner a perfect score, the first being "<a href="Vagrant%20Story">Vagrant Story</a>". The game was praised for its graphics, scenarios, game system, and the freshness it brought to the "Final Fantasy" series. It was praised for its seamless transitions between full motion video segments and the in-game engine, and was voted number one for Best Art Style on <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s weekly Top Ten. "<a href="Newtype%20USA">Newtype USA</a>" named "Final Fantasy XII" its "Game of the Month" for November 2006, praised the gameplay, graphics, and story, and called it "the best RPG to have been released for any Sony platform".

Although <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> lauded the gambit and license systems as an innovative and in-depth way for the player to control the characters, it criticized them for being too complicated and difficult to adjust to, especially for newer players of the series. The reviewer also criticized the sometimes tedious back and forth travel. On the other hand, GameSpot took particular note of the "excellent" voice cast. IGN praised the game's rich storyline and artistic direction, shown through its "sheer depth of character". It also assuaged criticism that the gambit system would "let the game play itself", countering that gambits do not function without a player. However, IGN wrote that while "still extremely strong", "Final Fantasy XII" has one of the series' weaker soundtracks.

Executive producer <a href="Akitoshi%20Kawazu">Akitoshi Kawazu</a> was pleased by "Famitsu"'s rating but admitted that he thought the game was not perfect; he felt that the storyline did not meet some fans' expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the <a href="PlayOnline">PlayOnline</a> and "Final Fantasy Tactics" members of the development team.

"Final Fantasy XII" was named best PlayStation 2 game and best RPG by numerous video game journals and websites, including GameSpot, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> and <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. Both "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" and "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" awarded it <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> 2006. The <a href="Japan%20Game%20Awards">Japan Game Awards</a> 2006 honored "Final Fantasy XII" with their "Grand Award" and "Award for Excellence" and the <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> Awards 2006 bestowed the "Double Platinum Prize". It was selected for the list "Top 100 New Japanese Styles", a list of "products and services originating in Japan to serve as a mark of excellence". "Final Fantasy XII" also received nominations in such categories as best RPG, story, art direction, character design and original musical score at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Interactive Achievement Awards</a>, <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> <a href="British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">Video Games Awards</a>, <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, and the <a href="11th%20Satellite%20Awards">Satellite Awards</a>.

An expanded version of the game, "Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System", was released in Japan on August 10, 2007. It includes twelve license boards (instead of the original game's one), each corresponding to a different <a href="Astrological%20sign">Zodiac sign</a> and <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20classes">job</a>. The player can control guest characters and summons, and hold L1 to double the game's running speed. There is also a "<a href="New%20Game%2B">New Game+</a>" option, a "New Game- (minus)" option (in which characters do not gain experience), and a "Trial Mode" in which the player hunts monsters in 100 different maps to gain items and money. The game also includes the western version's English voices and <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> 16:9 support, and a bonus DVD.

A sequel", ", was released for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> in 2007. It takes place one year after the events of "Final Fantasy XII" and follows the adventures of Vaan. The game is one of four in the "<a href="Ivalice%20Alliance">Ivalice Alliance</a>" series, which also includes "International Zodiac Job System".

"<a href="Fortress%20%28Grin%29">Fortress</a>", a spin-off action game developed by <a href="Grin%20%28company%29">Grin</a>, was to have been a "game with an epic scale both in story and production values" that took place in Ivalice following the events of "Revenant Wings". Square Enix cancelled the project after six months of development.

In July 2017, Square Enix released "Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age," a <a href="High-definition%20remasters%20for%20PlayStation%20consoles">high-definition remaster</a> of the Japanese-only "International Zodiac Job System" for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>.

Attachment theory

Attachment theory is a psychological model attempting to describe the dynamics of long-term and short-term <a href="interpersonal%20relationship">interpersonal relationship</a>s between humans. "Attachment theory is not formulated as a general theory of relationships; it addresses only a specific facet": how human beings respond in relationships when hurt, separated from loved ones, or perceiving a threat.

Provided any caregiver, all infants become attached—however individual differences in the quality of the relationships remain significant.

In infants, attachment as a motivational and behavioral system directs the child to seek proximity with a familiar caregiver when they are alarmed, with expectation they will receive protection and emotional support.

<a href="John%20Bowlby">John Bowlby</a> believed that the tendency for primate infants to develop attachments to familiar caregivers was the result of evolutionary pressures, since attachment behavior would facilitate the infant's survival in the face of dangers such as predation or exposure to the elements.

The most important tenet of attachment theory is an infant needs to develop a relationship with at least one <a href="primary%20caregiver">primary caregiver</a> for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction. In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a "safe base" from which to explore.

This relationship can be <a href="Dyad%20%28sociology%29">dyadic</a>, as in the mother-child dyad often studied in Western culture, or it can involve a community of caregivers (siblings/extended family/teachers) as can be seen in areas of Africa and South America.

It should be recognized "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about fifty per cent of the time. Their communications are either out of sync, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired."

Attachments between infants and caregivers form even if this caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in <a href="social%20interaction">social interaction</a>s with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves as best they can in such relationships.

Based on her established <a href="Strange%20situation">Strange Situation Protocol</a>, research by <a href="Developmental%20psychology">developmental psychologist</a> <a href="Mary%20Ainsworth">Mary Ainsworth</a> in the 1960s and 1970s found children will have different patterns of attachment depending on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.<ref name="Bretherton/Mul"></ref>

Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children:

In the 1980s, the theory was extended to <a href="attachment%20in%20adults">attachment in adults</a>. Attachment applies to adults when adults feel close attachment to their parents, their romantic and platonic partners and their friends.

Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.

In attachment theory, "attachment" means "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood.

<a href="John%20Bowlby">John Bowlby</a> begins by noting organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like "fixed action patterns" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be "goal-corrected" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey).

The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided these do not deviate much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development.

For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication.

Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate bonds exist. Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) toward more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.

The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain the accessibility and availability of the attachment figure. Many cultures use multiple forms of attachment including the <a href="Dyadic%20developmental%20psychotherapy">dyadic</a> model most prominent in Western cultures and <a href="allomothering">allomothering</a>.

Alarm is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger.

Anxiety is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs.

In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability, or signs of rejection or <a href="Abandonment%20%28emotional%29">abandonment</a>.

The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure.

Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity.

During the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.

By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.

With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a "safe base" from which to explore. Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited. Anxiety, fear, illness, and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.

After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder, shout, or follow.

Common attachment behaviours and emotions, displayed in most social primates including humans, are <a href="Adaption">adaptive</a>. The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> societies. There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the "set-goal" of the attachment behavioural system.
Bowlby's original account of a <a href="Critical%20period">sensitivity period</a> during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed.

With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term "monotropy" to describe this bias. Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs "qualitatively" from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience.

Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships. They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings.

The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors. As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.

In Western culture child-rearing, there is a focus on single attachment to primarily the mother. This dyadic model is not the only strategy of attachment producing a secure and emotionally adept child. Having a single, dependably responsive and sensitive caregiver (namely the mother) does not guarantee the ultimate success of the child. Results from Israeli, Dutch and east African studies show children with multiple caregivers grow up not only feeling secure, but developed "more enhanced capacities to view the world from multiple perspectives." This evidence can be more readily found in hunter-gatherer communities rather than Western day-care contexts.

In hunter-gatherer communities, in the past and present, mothers are the primary caregivers but share the maternal responsibility of ensuring the child's survival with a variety of different <a href="Allomothering">allomothers</a>. So while the mother is important, she is not the only opportunity for relational attachment a child can make. Several group members (with or without blood relation) contribute to the task of bringing up a child, sharing the parenting role and therefore can be sources of multiple attachment. There is evidence of this communal parenting throughout history that "would have significant implications for the evolution of multiple attachment."

In "non-metropolis" India (where "dual income nuclear families" are more the norm / dyadic mother relationship is), where a family normally consists of 3 generations (and if lucky 4: grandparents, parents & child / children, and maybe great-grandparents too), the child / children by default have four / six caregivers from whom to select for their "attachment figure". And a child's "uncles and aunts" (father's siblings and their spouses) also contribute to the child's psycho-social enrichment.

Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence.

The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by <a href="Mary%20Ainsworth">Mary Ainsworth</a> as a result of her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis '<a href="Reactive%20attachment%20disorder">Reactive Attachment Disorder</a> (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and <a href="attachment%20disorder">attachment disorder</a> are not synonymous.

The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infants' pattern of attachment to their caregiver by introducing an unexpected threat, two brief separations from the mother followed by reunion. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher films the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the infant experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar person (the Stranger). The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher:


Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviour (although other behaviors are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Group B (later called 'secure'), Group A (later called 'anxious avoidant'), and Group C (later called 'anxious ambivalent'). There are subclassifications for each group (see below).

Beginning in 1970, a series of expansions were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects a different kind of attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus not a part of the infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour." “Individuals with different attachment styles have different beliefs about romantic love period, availability, trust capability of love partners and love readiness.” 

A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4. Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively "loose" terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as "secure-reserved", B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as "secure-balanced", and B4's as "secure-reactive". In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.

Anxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as "resistant attachment". In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when his mother returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.

The C1 (ambivalent resistant) subtype is coded when "resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes".

Regarding the C2 (ambivalent passive) subtype, Ainsworth et al. wrote:Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release ... In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby.Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also found that children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:... conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away ... If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile ... Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in "abortive" fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing ... If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down.Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver.

Ainsworth's student <a href="Mary%20Main">Mary Main</a> theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as "a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection" by de-emphasising attachment needs.

Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ("disorganized distress"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.

Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through." Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress". Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below). Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague <a href="Mary%20Main">Mary Main</a>. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely "recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior".

There is rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as "open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated as if they were the same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." For example, "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person."

Main and Hesse found most of the mothers of these children had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, fifty-six per cent of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.

Across different cultures deviations from the Strange Situation Protocol have been observed. A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children, with no children categorized as avoidant. This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds more so than in Western cultures. In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, & Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, & Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distribution of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985). Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern, which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed to a greater parental push toward children's independence. Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence.

Techniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the "stem story", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it. For older children, adolescents and adults, semi-structured interviews are used in which the manner of relaying content may be as significant as the content itself. However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (approximately 7 to 13 years of age).
Some studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.

<a href="Patricia%20McKinsey%20Crittenden">Patricia McKinsey Crittenden</a> has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that "given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adulthood the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive".

Crittenden proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:

1. 'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this "affective information". In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.

2. Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (See section above on Disorganized/disoriented attachment for distinction of "Types"): "Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond." Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively utilise both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.

Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Child%20Health%20and%20Human%20Development">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care</a> and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that "for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%."

There is an extensive body of research demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, but it is a liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.

Some authors have questioned the idea that a <a href="wikt%3Ataxonomy">taxonomy</a> of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed. Examination of data from 1,139 15-month-olds showed that variation in attachment patterns was continuous rather than grouped. This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types. However, it has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which "neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment."

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of <a href="Adaption">adaptive</a> significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. <a href="Adrenarche">Adrenarche</a> is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.

Childhood and adolescence allows the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.

Age, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual <a href="coregulation">coregulation</a> of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.

The attachment system used by adolescents is seen as a "safety regulating system" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescence we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media. Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescent teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescents teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress.

Here are the attachment style differences during adolescence.
Secure adolescents are expected to hold their mothers at a higher rate than all other support figures, including father, boy and girlfriends, and best friends.
Insecure adolescents identify more strongly with their peers than their parents as their primary attachment figures. Their friends are seen as a significantly strong source of attachment support.
Dismissing adolescents rate their parents as a less significant source of attachment support and would consider themselves as their primary attachment figure.
Preoccupied adolescents would rate their parents a their primary source of attachment support and would consider themselves as a much less significant source of attachment support.

Attachment theory was extended to adult <a href="romantic%20relationship">romantic relationship</a>s in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.

Securely attached adults tend to have positive views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Feeling secure has to do with a person's perception of control, feelings of competence, and a belief that they possess the ability to meet the challenges that they will face in the future. With adults, attachments in general, are more cumulative and much more multifaceted than earlier attachments. There are more exchanges of support within someone's inner circle relationships or secure relationships, such as respect, confiding, reassurance, sick care, talking about one's health, and talking about things that could worry or upset them. These types of exchanges provide adults with a secure base that they are able to depend on a daily basis.

Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. The anxiety that adults feel prevent the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individual's intense and/or unstable relationship that leave the anxious or preoccupied individual relatively defenseless. Adults with this attachment style tend to look way too far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation. Their thought and actions can lead to a painful cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies and even self-sabotage. They often seek a dismissive-avoidant partner.

Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness.

Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.

Sexually, securely attached individuals are less likely to be involved in one-night stands or sexual activity outside of the primary relationship, and more likely to report mutual initiation and enjoyment of sex.

Dismissive-avoidant individuals tend to report activities reflecting low psychological intimacy (one-night sex, extra-dyadic sex, sex without love), as well as less enjoyment of physical contact. Research has demonstrated that for both sexes, insecure-ambivalent attachment was related to enjoyment of holding and caressing, but not of more clearly sexual behaviors.

Relationally, insecure individuals tend to be partnered with insecure individuals, and secure individuals with secure individuals. Insecure relationships tend to be enduring but less emotionally satisfying compared to the relationship(s) of two securely attached individuals.

Attachment styles are activated from the first date onwards and impact relationship dynamics and how a relationship ends. Secure attachment has been shown to allow for better conflict resolution in a relationship and for one's ability to exit an unsatisfying relationship compared to other attachment types. Secure individuals authentic high self-esteem and positive view of others allows for this as they are confident that they will find another relationship. Secure attachment has also shown to allow for the successful processing of relational losses (e.g. death, rejection, infidelity, abandonment etc.) Attachment has also been shown to impact caregiving behavior in relationships, too (Shaver & Cassidy, 2018)
Two main aspects of adult attachment have been studied. The organization and stability of the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.

There are a number of different measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the <a href="Attachment%20measures%23Adult%20Attachment%20Interview%20.28AAI.29">Adult Attachment Interview</a>. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, platonic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.

The early thinking of the <a href="Object%20relations%20theory">object relations school</a> of <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, particularly <a href="Melanie%20Klein">Melanie Klein</a>, influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of <a href="William%20Goldfarb">William Goldfarb</a> published in 1943 and 1945. Bowlby's contemporary <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Spitz">René Spitz</a> observed separated children's grief, proposing that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care. A strong influence was the work of social worker and psychoanalyst <a href="James%20Robertson%20%28psychoanalyst%29">James Robertson</a> who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film "A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital" which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.

In his 1951 monograph for the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, <a href="Maternal%20deprivation">"Maternal Care and Mental Health"</a>, Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment", the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as "Child Care and the Growth of Love" for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial. At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion. Nevertheless, Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a "great body of research" in an extremely difficult, complex area. Bowlby's work (and Robertson's films) caused a virtual revolution in hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children's play, educational and social needs and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family-style homes in most developed countries.
Following the publication of "Maternal Care and Mental Health", Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, <a href="developmental%20psychology">developmental psychology</a>, <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a> and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant's emotional tie to the caregiver(s) emerged as a result of <a href="evolutionary%20pressure">evolutionary pressure</a>. He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than Freud's psychic energy model. Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" of "Maternal Care and Mental Health".

Bowlby's attention was first drawn to <a href="ethology">ethology</a> when he read <a href="Konrad%20Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a>'s 1952 publication in draft form (although Lorenz had published earlier work). Other important influences were ethologists <a href="Nikolaas%20Tinbergen">Nikolaas Tinbergen</a> and <a href="Robert%20Hinde">Robert Hinde</a>. Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde. In 1953 Bowlby stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests." Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "<a href="Imprinting%20%28psychology%29">imprinting</a>", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a <a href="wikt%3Aconspecific">conspecific</a> or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.
Certain types of learning are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range known as a <a href="critical%20period">critical period</a>. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped. Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalization to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that concepts used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself. Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned and expanded the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings provided other behaviours that might indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects, bringing them to the mother but not to others. Although ethologists tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, they pressed for more data, objecting to psychologists writing as if there were an "entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures." <a href="Robert%20Hinde">Robert Hinde</a> considered "attachment behaviour system" to be an appropriate term which did not offer the same problems "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour."

<a href="Psychoanalysis">Psychoanalytic</a> concepts influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, the observations by <a href="Anna%20Freud">Anna Freud</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Burlingham">Dorothy Burlingham</a> of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including "<a href="Drive%20theory%20%28psychoanalysis%29">drive theory</a>" in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the "<a href="Cupboard%20Love">cupboard-love</a>" theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality. Based on ideas of primary attachment and <a href="Neo-Darwinism">Neo-Darwinism</a>, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear "phases" with <a href="regression%20%28psychology%29">"regression"</a> to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.

The philosopher <a href="Kenneth%20Craik">Kenneth Craik</a> had noted the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of natural selection for this ability. A key component of attachment theory is the attachment behavior system. where certain behaviors have a predictable outcome (i.e. proximity) and serve as self-preservation method (i.e. protection). All taking place outside of an individuals awareness, This <a href="Internal%20Working%20Model%20of%20Attachment">internal working model</a> allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.

Infants absorb all sorts of complex social-emotional information from the social interactions that they observe. They notice the helpful and hindering behaviors of one person to another. From these observations they develop expectations of how two characters should behave, known as a "secure base script." These scripts provide as a template of how attachment related events should unfold and they are the building blocks of ones internal working models. <a href="infant">infant</a>'s internal working model is developed in response to the infant's experience based internal working models of self, and environment, with emphasis on the caregiving environment and the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. Theoretically, secure child and adult script, would allow for an attachment situation where one person successfully utilizes another as a secure base from which to explore and as a safe haven in times of distress. In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications. For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops. In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers. Childhood attachment has a direct impact on our adult relationships.

A <a href="parent">parent</a>'s internal working model that is operative in the attachment relationship with her infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations. Recent research has demonstrated that the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.

In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example <a href="Kisii%20people">Gusii</a> infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar <a href="Michael%20Rutter">Michael Rutter</a> in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of "<a href="amae">amae</a>" plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where "amae" is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in <a href="Sapporo">Sapporo</a> in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.

Critics in the 1990s such as <a href="Judith%20Rich%20Harris">J. R. Harris</a>, <a href="Steven%20Pinker">Steven Pinker</a> and <a href="Jerome%20Kagan">Jerome Kagan</a> were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism (<a href="nature%20versus%20nurture">nature versus nurture</a>), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on <a href="temperament">temperament</a> of <a href="Stella%20Chess">Stella Chess</a>, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development. Psychoanalyst/psychologists <a href="Peter%20Fonagy">Peter Fonagy</a> and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as <a href="mentalization">mentalization</a>. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression. It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory. Since the late 1980s, there has been a developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. <a href="Object%20relations">Object relations</a> models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a growing recognition in psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma. A psychoanalytically based exploration of the attachment system and an accompanying clinical approach has emerged together with a recognition of the need for measurement of outcomes of interventions. 
One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care. As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past. A <a href="natural%20experiment">natural experiment</a> permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the <a href="Nicolae%20Ceau%C5%9Fescu">Nicolae Ceauşescu</a> regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by <a href="Michael%20Rutter">Michael Rutter</a>, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.

Authors considering attachment in non-Western cultures have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. As children's experience of care changes, so may attachment-related experiences. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time. Issues have been raised to the effect that the <a href="wikt%3Adyadic">dyadic</a> model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings. It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.

Principles of attachment theory have been used to explain adult social behaviours, including mating, social dominance and hierarchical power structures, in-group identification, group coalitions, and negotiation of reciprocity and justice. Those explanations have been used to design parental care training, and have been particularly successful in the design of child abuse prevention programmes.

While a wide variety of studies have upheld the basic tenets of attachment theory, research has been inconclusive as to whether self-reported early attachment and later depression are demonstrably related.

In addition to longitudinal studies, there has been <a href="Psychophysiology">psychophysiological</a> research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include <a href="neural%20development">neural development</a>, <a href="behaviour%20genetics">behaviour genetics</a> and <a href="temperament">temperament</a> concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute to a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.

The quality of caregiving received at infancy and childhood directly affects an individual's neurological systems which controls stress regulation. In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been <a href="Autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic response</a>s, such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the <a href="hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal%20axis">hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis</a>, a system that is responsible for the body's reaction to <a href="stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a>. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament and the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. Recent studies convey that early attachment relationships become molecularly instilled into the being, thus affecting later immune system functioning. Empirical evidence communicates that early negative experiences produce pro inflammatory phenotype cells in the immune system, which is directly related to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancer.

Recent improvements involving methods of research have enabled researchers to further investigate the neural correlates of attachment in humans. These advances include identifying key brain structures, neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides, and how they are involved in attachment system functioning and can tell us more about a certain individual, even predict their behavior. There is initial evidence that caregiving and attachment involve both unique and overlapping brain regions. Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29%23Genetic%20polymorphism">polymorphism</a> of the gene coding for the <a href="Dopamine%20receptor%20D2">D</a> <a href="dopamine%20receptor">dopamine receptor</a> has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the <a href="5-HT2A%20receptor">5-HT</a> <a href="serotonin%20receptor">serotonin receptor</a> with avoidant attachment. Studies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity. For example, individuals with an avoidance attachment style produce higher levels of the pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) when reacting to an interpersonal stressor, while individuals representing an anxious attachment style tend to have elevated cortisol production and lower numbers of T cells. Although children vary genetically and each individual requires different attachment relationships, there is consistent evidence that maternal warmth during infancy and childhood creates a safe haven for individuals resulting in superior immune system functioning. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.

As a theory of <a href="Developmental%20psychology">socioemotional development</a>, attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.

Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby's development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice. In 2008 <a href="C.H.%20Zeanah">C.H. Zeanah</a> and colleagues stated, "Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community-based service providers and policy makers ... Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships." Seeing that early child parent relationships is crucial for child development. You would assume that individuals would be educated on child development and the importance of the early parent-child relationship. However, our current education system is more concerned with sex education rather than healthy relationship tactics and skills needed to parent in a sensitive, responsive manner. If Researchers and educators could work together and develop future-parent curriculum for the high school and university levels, It would benefit society as a whole. With the dynamic nature of social and economic environments, many families struggle balancing work and family responsibilities. Finding quality childcare while at work or school is another issue for many families.NIHD recent study convey that top notch day care contributes to secure attachment relationships in children. people have commented on this matter stating that “legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions” Corporations should implement more flexible work arrangements that recognize child care as essential for all its employees. This includes re-examination of parental leave policies. Too many parents are forced to return to work too soon post childbirth because of company policy or financial necessity. No matter the reason this inhibits early parent child bonding. In addition to this, there should be increased attention to the training and screening of childcare workers. In his article reviewing Attachment Theory, Sweeney suggested, among several policy implications, “legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions” 

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, and those in poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.

Attachment theory has implications in <a href="Residence%20in%20English%20family%20law">residence</a> and <a href="Contact%20%28law%29">contact</a> disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. <a href="Michael%20Rutter">Rutter</a> noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along with the impact of step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in <a href="social%20work">social work</a>, especially in <a href="Humanistic%20psychology">humanistic social work</a> (<a href="Microsociology">Petru Stefaroi</a>), and court processes about <a href="foster%20care">foster care</a> or other placements. Considering the child's attachment needs can help determine the level of risk posed by placement options. Within adoption, the shift from "closed" to "open" adoptions and the importance of the search for biological parents would be expected on the basis of attachment theory. Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.

Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of <a href="Developmental%20psychology">socioemotional development</a> with one of the widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice.
The attachment theory focused on the attention of the child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscientific</a> interventions misleadingly known as "<a href="attachment%20therapy">attachment therapy</a>".

In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents' internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents' relationship with the therapeutic intervenor. Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and prevention and intervention programmes. In regards to personal development, children from all the age groups were tested to show the effectiveness of the theory that is being theorized by Bowlby. They range from individual therapy to public health programmes to interventions designed for foster caregivers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programmes are aimed at foster carers because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern prevention and intervention programmes have proven successful.

One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as "reactive attachment disorder" or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis (<a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> F94.1/2 and <a href="DSM-IV-TR">DSM-IV-TR</a> 313.89). Against common misconception, this is not the same as 'disorganized attachment'. The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that may appear to resemble a clinical disorder. Although the term "reactive attachment disorder" is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, "true" RAD is thought to be rare.

"Attachment disorder" is an ambiguous term, which may be used to refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematical insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put forward by theorists in the field, and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis. One of the proposed new classifications, "secure base distortion" has been found to be associated with caregiver traumatization.

As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within <a href="relational%20psychoanalysis">relational psychoanalysis</a> and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.

U.S. Route 8

U.S. Highway 8 (US 8) is a <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway">United States Numbered Highway</a> that runs primarily east–west for , mostly within the state of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. It connects <a href="Interstate%2035">Interstate 35</a> (I-35) in <a href="Forest%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota">Forest Lake, Minnesota</a>, to <a href="U.S.%20Route%202">US 2</a> at <a href="Norway%2C%20Michigan">Norway</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> near the border with Wisconsin. Except for the short freeway segment near Forest Lake, and sections near the <a href="St.%20Croix%20River%20%28Wisconsin%E2%80%93Minnesota%29">St. Croix River</a> bridge and <a href="Rhinelander%2C%20Wisconsin">Rhinelander, Wisconsin</a>, it is mostly undivided surface road. As a state highway in the three states, US 8 is maintained by the <a href="Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan</a> departments of transportation (MnDOT, WisDOT, MDOT, respectively).

The highway was originally commissioned on November 11, 1926, with the rest of the original U.S. Highway System. At the time, it ran between Forest Lake, Minnesota, and <a href="Pembine%2C%20Wisconsin">Pembine, Wisconsin</a>, with a planned continuation to <a href="Powers%2C%20Michigan">Powers, Michigan</a>. Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then. The western end was extended south to <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> before it was truncated back to Forest Lake. Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway. Internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original 1926 terminus. US 8's course through the three states has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years.

WisDOT built a bypass around the city of <a href="Rhinelander%2C%20Wisconsin">Rhinelander</a> in the 1990s and created a <a href="business%20route">business loop</a> along the old highway through the town. This loop was a locally maintained route through the <a href="central%20business%20district">central business district</a> in Rhinelander. The signage for the loop was removed in 2005.

US 8 begins at an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2035%20in%20Minnesota">I-35</a> in <a href="Forest%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota">Forest Lake</a>. This interchange is incomplete: traffic can only access US 8 directly from northbound I-35, and westbound traffic on US 8 merges onto southbound I-35. The first segment of roadway to Forest Lake is a <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">freeway</a>, with an interchange at <a href="U.S.%20Route%2061%20in%20Minnesota">US 61</a>. East of this junction, the highway follows Lake Boulevard North around Forest Lake and continues northeasterly through the community to cross the <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Washington</a>–<a href="Chisago%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Chisago</a> county line. The highway continues to the northeast along farmland and the shore of <a href="Green%20Lake%20%28Chisago%20City%2C%20Minnesota%29">Green Lake</a> to <a href="Chisago%20City%2C%20Minnesota">Chisago City</a>, where it meets up with County Road 22 (CR 22). US 8 follows Lake Boulevard through Chisago City along the isthmus between the larger Chisago Lake and the smaller Wallmark Lake on the eastern side of town. The highway turns along a more easterly path in <a href="Lindstr%C3%B6m%2C%20Minnesota">Lindström</a> between North and South Lindström lakes. East of those lakes, US 8 crosses into the town of <a href="Center%20City%2C%20Minnesota">Center City</a>.

In Center City, US 8 runs between North and South Center lakes, curving around the north shore of South Center Lake. On the eastern edge of town, it turns due east for several miles and runs through <a href="Shafer%2C%20Minnesota">Shafer</a>. US 8 merges with <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2095">State Highway 95</a> (MN 95) at a roundabout about southwest of <a href="Taylors%20Falls%2C%20Minnesota">Taylors Falls</a>. The two highways <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrently</a> turn northeast along the <a href="St.%20Croix%20River%20%28Wisconsin-Minnesota%29">St. Croix River</a>, entering town. At this point, MN 95 continues north along the river while US 8 turns east to cross the St. Croix River, exiting the state of Minnesota into <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>.
<a href="Legislative%20route%20%28Minnesota%29">Legally</a>, the Minnesota section of US 8 is defined as Constitutional Route 46 and Legislative Route 98 in the Minnesota Statutes §§ and ; the roadway is not marked with those numbers. The section of US 8 in Chisago County is officially designated the Moberg Trail.

US 8 enters <a href="Polk%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Polk County</a> at <a href="St.%20Croix%20Falls%2C%20Wisconsin">St. Croix Falls</a> as a multilane roadway. It joins <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2035">State Highway 35</a> (WIS 35) at a <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> located approximately from the state line. The two highways run concurrently for before WIS 35 turns off to the north at a location in the <a href="St.%20Croix%20Falls%20%28town%29%2C%20Wisconsin">Town of St. Croix Falls</a> west of Deer Lake. US 8 continues eastward through forest lands, and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2046">WIS 46</a> joins from the north for a concurrency before splitting off to the south. Continuing eastward, US 8 passes through <a href="Range%2C%20Wisconsin">Range</a> and crosses into <a href="Barron%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Barron County</a> at <a href="Turtle%20Lake%2C%20Wisconsin">Turtle Lake</a>. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2063%20in%20Wisconsin">US 63</a> merges from the south near Turtle Lake and departs to the north in the downtown area. The roadway passes through <a href="Poskin%2C%20Wisconsin">Poskin</a> and intersects <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2025">WIS 25</a> in <a href="Barron%2C%20Wisconsin">Barron</a>. East of Barron, US 8 meets <a href="U.S.%20Route%2053%20in%20Wisconsin">US 53</a> at a mixed diamond/cloverleaf interchange and turns north into <a href="Cameron%2C%20Barron%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Cameron</a>, then turns east in downtown to leave the latter community. After a straightaway, the highway crosses into <a href="Rusk%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Rusk County</a>, and then it continues due east for an additional before turning northeast and passing through <a href="Weyerhaeuser%2C%20Wisconsin">Weyerhaeuser</a>. Continuing northeasterly, the roadway crosses <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2040">WIS 40</a> in <a href="Bruce%2C%20Wisconsin">Bruce</a>. East of town, the highway continues through rural Rusk County, and US 8 meets <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2027">WIS 27</a> in downtown <a href="Ladysmith%2C%20Wisconsin">Ladysmith</a>.
Upon leaving Ladysmith, US 8 passes through the communities of <a href="Tony%2C%20Wisconsin">Tony</a>, <a href="Glen%20Flora%2C%20Wisconsin">Glen Flora</a>, <a href="Ingram%2C%20Wisconsin">Ingram</a> (where it meets the northern terminus of <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2073">WIS 73</a>) and <a href="Hawkins%2C%20Wisconsin">Hawkins</a> on its way out of Rusk County. In <a href="Price%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Price County</a>, US 8 passes through <a href="Kennan%2C%20Wisconsin">Kennan</a> and <a href="Catawba%2C%20Wisconsin">Catawba</a>. <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%20111">WIS 111</a> terminates at its south end on US 8 just east of Catawba. US 8 meets <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2013">WIS 13</a> at a diamond interchange northwest of <a href="Prentice%2C%20Wisconsin">Prentice</a> and passes north of the city. The highway passes through <a href="Brantwood%2C%20Wisconsin">Brantwood</a> and enters <a href="Lincoln%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Lincoln County</a> at <a href="Clifford%2C%20Wisconsin">Clifford</a>. Further east, US 8 crosses <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Wisconsin">Tripoli</a> and <a href="McCord%2C%20Wisconsin">McCord</a> and runs north of <a href="Tomahawk%2C%20Wisconsin">Tomahawk</a> as it passes through the Lake Nokomis area. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2051%20in%20Wisconsin">US 51</a> crosses US 8 northeast of Tomahawk. US 8 turns northeast into <a href="Oneida%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Oneida County</a> and onto a twisting northeasterly alignment. The highway passes through <a href="Woodboro%2C%20Wisconsin">Woodboro</a> and expands to a divided highway into Rhinelander. It merges with <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2047">WIS 47</a> on the southwest side of <a href="Rhinelander%2C%20Wisconsin">Rhinelander</a>. <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2017">WIS 17</a> north joins the highways to the southeast, creating a <a href="wrong-way%20concurrency">wrong-way concurrency</a> with WIS 47; along this section of highway, eastbound US 8 is also southbound WIS 47 and northbound WIS 17 and vice versa. WIS 17 turns to the north southeast of there, and US 8 and WIS 47 head eastbound out of the Rhinelander area.

US 8 intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%2045%20in%20Wisconsin">US 45</a> south in <a href="Monico%2C%20Wisconsin">Monico</a>, and WIS 47 splits from US 8 to follow US 45 south. Immediately east of the same intersection, US 45 north follows US 8 for before splitting to the north. US 8 enters <a href="Forest%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Forest County</a> east of Monico. into the county, the highway merges with <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2032">WIS 32</a> from the north in <a href="Crandon%2C%20Wisconsin">Crandon</a> and the two highways head east to <a href="Laona%2C%20Wisconsin">Laona</a> where US 8 turns north and WIS 32 turns south. US 8 turns east again at <a href="Cavour%2C%20Wisconsin">Cavour</a> and passes through the community of <a href="Armstrong%20Creek%2C%20Wisconsin">Armstrong Creek</a> from the <a href="Marinette%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Marinette County</a> line. The highway passes through <a href="Goodman%2C%20Wisconsin">Goodman</a> and <a href="Dunbar%2C%20Wisconsin">Dunbar</a> as it meanders through the county and joins <a href="U.S.%20Route%20141">US 141</a> at <a href="Pembine%2C%20Wisconsin">Pembine</a>. The two routes split further north near <a href="Niagara%2C%20Wisconsin">Niagara</a>; after the split, US 8 heads east. The highway takes a northward turn and heads across the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> into <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> near Pier's Gorge Park.
Entering Michigan south of <a href="Norway%2C%20Michigan">Norway</a> at the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> crossing in <a href="Norway%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Norway Township</a>, US 8 proceeds north into the city where it ends at <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a>. US 8 in Michigan is long; in this segment, the road passes by the <a href="Dickinson%20County%2C%20Michigan">Dickinson County</a> fairgrounds and <a href="Norway%20Speedway">Norway Speedway</a>.

Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway across the state from <a href="St.%20Croix%20Falls%2C%20Wisconsin">St. Croix Falls</a> to <a href="Armstrong%20Creek%2C%20Wisconsin">Armstrong Creek</a> was numbered <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2014">WIS 14</a> at that time. The remainder of what is now US 8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WIS 14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to <a href="Florence%20%28CDP%29%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence</a>. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US 8 was not included in the system. In Minnesota, US 8 would follow what was Constitutional Route 46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and <a href="Chisago%20City%2C%20Minnesota">Chisago City</a> through <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Minnesota">Wyoming</a>.
The first changes to the routings of the predecessor highways were made by Wisconsin by 1920. A series of curves were added between Turtle Lake and Barron adding "stair steps" to the routing while similar jogs were removed near Cameron, Weyerhauser, Hawkins and Prentice. WIS 14 was rerouted between Rhinelander and <a href="Pelican%20Lake%2C%20Wisconsin">Pelican Lake</a> to run via <a href="Monico%2C%20Wisconsin">Monico</a>, and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2038">WIS 38</a> (the future US 141) was extended northward from <a href="Wausaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Wausaukee</a> to terminate at the state line near <a href="Niagara%2C%20Wisconsin">Niagara</a>. The realignment between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake was shown as reversed by 1922. By 1925, the highway in that area was again rerouted to run directly from Rhinelander to Monico, but instead of turning south to Pelican Lake, it was run directly to Crandon. That same year, WIS 14 was extended eastward from Armstrong Creek to Pembine and northward to Niagara. The north–south section, previously numbered WIS 38, was also redesignated as part of <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2057">WIS 57</a>.

US 8 was created with the beginnings of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> on November 26, 1926. The highway was originally shown on maps running between <a href="Forest%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota">Forest Lake, Minnesota</a> and <a href="Powers%2C%20Michigan">Powers, Michigan</a>. At the time, its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> in Michigan. The trunkline connection from <a href="Quinnesec%2C%20Michigan">Quinnesec</a> south into Wisconsin was part of <a href="M-57%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-57</a>, which met WIS 57 at the state line. US 8 ended at WIS 57 in Pembine at the time, with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps. A map by the <a href="American%20Automobile%20Association">American Automobile Association</a> does show the highway continuing east through <a href="Faithorn%2C%20Michigan">Faithorn</a> and <a href="Hermansville%2C%20Michigan">Hermansville</a> in Michigan to end at US 2. The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously indicated an unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville. A later extension in 1927 moved US 8 to run along <a href="U.S.%20Route%20141">US 141</a>, which had replaced WIS 57 and M-57, ending in Quinnesec at US 2. By the next year, the highway was shifted to end in Norway, utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan.

In 1931, US 8 was extended south from Forest Lake into downtown <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>. West of the Rhinelander area, US 8 and US 51 overlapped for about as US 8 jogged northward along US 51. This concurrency was altered in 1934, and two years later the short east–west section of US 8/US 51 was removed when changes to US 51's routing were finished in the area. A jog in the routing near <a href="Almena%2C%20Wisconsin">Almena</a> was removed in 1937 when Wisconsin rerouted the highway to a more direct alignment in the area.

The last segment of US 8 in Wisconsin was paved in 1937 between Cavour and Armstrong Creek; the highway in Minnesota was paved in its entirety by 1940. Near Hawkins, a pair of sharp curves near the Rusk–Price county line were removed as the State Highway Commission realigned the highway to follow a straighter course. The US 8/US 51 concurrency was altered the next year to a shorter overlap running southward near <a href="Heafford%20Junction%2C%20Wisconsin">Heafford Junction</a>. The former routing of US 8 was redesignated County Trunk Highway K (CTH-K) after it was transferred back to county control.

Starting around the year 1955, US 8 was moved to a more direct routing between Forest Lake and Chisago City; US 8 replaced <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2098">MN 98</a> along Legislative Route 98. The former routing between Wyoming and Chisago City along Constitutional Route 46 was then redesignated MN 98 until it was <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a> in the late 1990s.

As late as 1959, the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> still had plans to build the section of US 8 west of Hermansville to the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a>. The control section atlas published on January 1, 1959, showed this segment of highway on the <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Menominee County</a> map, complete with a control section number. The section of highway is shown as "proposed" or "under construction". However, a new bridge was built over the Menominee River to carry the highway across the Michigan–Wisconsin state line near Norway in 1966. WisDOT still shows the section of highway needed in their state to extend US 8 to the original eastern terminus in Michigan on internal maps. The December 31, 2004, edition of their "Official State Trunk Highway System Maps" shows this section as a "mapped corridor".

In the late 1970s, with ongoing construction and completion of the <a href="Interstate%2035W%20%28Minnesota%29">I-35W</a> freeway in Minnesota, US 8 was routed along I-35W; US 8 was truncated again by 1981 to its current terminus in Forest Lake. The section in <a href="New%20Brighton%2C%20Minnesota">New Brighton</a> is currently known as Old Highway 8.

WisDOT built a bypass of the city of Rhinelander during the early 1990s; the new highway was constructed south of town as a new two-lane highway that opened to traffic by 1993. The former route through downtown Rhinelander and near Clear and George lakes was redesignated as <a href="%23Business%20route">Business US 8</a> (Bus. US 8).

In 2002, US 8 was widened from two lanes to four lanes with a grass median between North Rifle Road and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2047">WIS 47</a> near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. At the time, officials with WisDOT had plans to extend the four-lane divided highway as far west as <a href="U.S.%20Route%2051%20in%20Wisconsin">US 51</a> near <a href="Tomahawk%2C%20Wisconsin">Tomahawk</a>. Problems related to wetlands in the construction area and bad weather pushed completion of the project back almost a year. Contractors had to install metal sheeting to stabilize the marshy ground. Originally scheduled to end in late 2002, the project did not finish until August 2003. The delays and additional work increased the price tag of the project from the original $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to $6.0 million (equivalent to $ in ). A section of the project was only designed for speeds for safety reasons. The design also allowed planners to limit the amount of land needed for the expansion.

Bill and Jerri Osberg sued the state and seven other parties in April 2003 over runoff from the construction, claiming that it killed hundreds of trees and polluted ponds on their property. Later investigation uncovered damage to wildlife habitat in the <a href="Wisconsin%20River">Wisconsin River</a>. Included in the original lawsuit were six individual WisDOT employees, the primary contractor and a local pet supply company. The court of appeals partially upheld a ruling by the district court dismissing the employees and the contractor from the lawsuit in March 2006. The pet supply company was reinstated in the case by the appeals court. The couple settled their claims, and the state pursued the matter against Pagel Construction in a related lawsuit. WisDOT alleged that the contractor did not follow proper erosion controls and failed to remediate the erosion damage to the Osbergs' property. The state wanted the construction company to forfeit their $70,000 retainer (equivalent to $ in ) and pay damages of $150,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Pagel Construction faulted WisDOT's erosion control plan and said that the state's engineers controlled the project and was seeking the return of its retainer. In September 2007, a jury ruled in favor of Pagel Construction and awarded them $70,898.13 in damages (equivalent to $ in ).

WisDOT has completed the environmental studies on bypasses of Barron and Cameron in Barron County. These bypasses would form a continuous expressway through the area. No funding has been identified to complete the projects. The entire length of US 8 in the state has been classified as a North Country Corridor in the Connections 2030 Plan by the department. This designation marks the highway as a priority in "continued safety, enhanced mobility and efficiency" as well as "modernization to correct outdated infrastructure design".

Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US 8) in <a href="Rhinelander%2C%20Wisconsin">Rhinelander, Wisconsin</a>, was a locally maintained business loop highway routing through the central business district of the city. The route was designated when US 8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in the 1990s. The former routing of US 8 through the area was turned over to the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway south of town. The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.

Before the signage was removed, Bus. US 8 started at the western junction of US 8 and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2047">WIS 47</a>. The business loop ran east from this intersection along Kemp Street, crossing the <a href="Wisconsin%20River">Wisconsin River</a> north of the convergence with the <a href="Pelican%20River%20%28Wisconsin%20River%29">Pelican River</a>. The loop jogged north along Oneida Street for 3 blocks and turned east again on Lincoln Street. East of town, Bus. US 8 intersected <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2017">WIS 17</a> and turned to the southeast. Outside of town, the business loop ran through wooded terrain and turned south near Clear Lake. Near the larger George Lake, the roadway curved back east along the lake's southern shore, running parallel to the main highway before turning south to connect to the main highway. At this intersection with US 8/WIS 47, the business loop ended after a total run of .

Katamari Damacy

The game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the <a href="star">star</a>s, <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s, and <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, which were accidentally destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly <a href="adhesive">adhesive</a> ball called a "katamari" around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. "Katamari Damacy"'s story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.

Overall, "Katamari Damacy" was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a> and won several awards. "Katamari Damacy" inspired the development of other video games, and led to the release of eight sequels in Japan and other territories: "<a href="We%20Love%20Katamari">We Love Katamari</a>" (<a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>), "<a href="Me%20%26amp%3B%20My%20Katamari">Me & My Katamari</a>" (<a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>), "<a href="Beautiful%20Katamari">Beautiful Katamari</a>" (<a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>), "<a href="I%20Love%20Katamari">I Love Katamari</a>" (<a href="iOS">iOS</a>, <a href="Windows%20Phone%207">Windows Phone 7</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>), "<a href="Katamari%20Forever">Katamari Forever</a>" (<a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>), "<a href="Katamari%20Amore">Katamari Amore</a>" (<a href="iOS">iOS</a>), "<a href="Touch%20My%20Katamari">Touch My Katamari</a>" (<a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>), and "<a href="Tap%20My%20Katamari">Tap My Katamari</a>" (<a href="iOS">iOS</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>). A high-definition remaster, "Katamari Damacy Reroll", was released on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in December 2018.

The primary story in "Katamari Damacy" deals with the aftermath of the planet-sized King of All Cosmos' <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a> spree that wiped out all the stars and other celestial bodies from the sky. The King (who appears to be chronically dissatisfied with his 5-cm-tall son's small size) charges the Prince to go to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> with a "katamari"—a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow—and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and constellations. The Prince is successful, and the sky is returned to normal.

A side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks. The father, an <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>, is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, "senses" the Prince's work—she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky. Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.

The player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos. The player uses the two <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a>s on the <a href="DualShock">DualShock</a> controller in a manner similar to the classic <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> "<a href="Battlezone%20%281980%20video%20game%29">Battlezone</a>" to control the direction the katamari rolls. Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.

Objects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari. This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.

The typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the "Make a Star" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear). The player can attempt a <a href="score%20attack">score attack</a> mode for any level, in which they try to make the greatest katamari possible in the time allotted. Certain levels can unlock an "eternal mode" by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.

Each level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a "royal present" that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots. The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.

In the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins. The screen is <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split</a> vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.

<a href="Keita%20Takahashi">Keita Takahashi</a> had studied art and entered the <a href="Musashino%20Art%20University">Musashino Art University</a> to study sculpting in 1995. During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium. Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called "Action Drive", inspired by "<a href="Crazy%20Taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>" but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to "Katamari Damacy": the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then "drive" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. "Action Drive" was eventually cancelled.

While working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of "Katamari Damacy". The first was a prototype shown by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> called "Densen" (Japanese for "power line") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of "tamakorogashi" played in Japanese school's "undōkai" or <a href="sports%20day">sports day</a>s. In "tamakorogashi", students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal. Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.

However, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that <a href="Konami">Konami</a> had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, <a href="Bemani">Bemani</a>) that were highly successful, including "<a href="Beatmania">Beatmania</a>", "<a href="GuitarFreaks">GuitarFreaks</a>", and "<a href="Dance%20Dance%20Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a>". Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, <a href="Masaya%20Nakamura%20%28businessman%29">Masaya Nakamura</a> was principle of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.

Takahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.

One initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the <a href="Emotion%20Engine">Emotion Engine</a>, but had not provided any updated <a href="software%20development%20kit">software development kit</a>s, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware, but resultantly made the console difficult to develop for at its launch. In contrast, <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> had recently announced the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to it previous <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release. In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped. The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's <a href="Japan%20Media%20Arts%20Festival">Japan Media Arts Festival</a> for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development.

Full work on "Katamari Damacy" began in late 2001. Namco assigned <a href="Now%20Production">Now Production</a>, based in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>, to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about (about at the time of production) for the game; this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as "<a href="Ridge%20Racer%20%28video%20game%29">Ridge Racer</a>" or "<a href="Soulcalibur%20%28video%20game%29">Soulcalibur</a>". The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.

Takahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor. Iwatani compared the game to Namco's "<a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>", which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company. At one point during development, Takahashi "proactively ignored" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.

The core gameplay of "Katamari Damacy" is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, "Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program". The patent, issued in 2009, primarily describes how the game maintains the roughly spherical nature of the katamari when objects are picked up, though extends to concepts such as tracking objects collected based on temperature or weight values, which were modes included with later games of the series.

A single-level demonstration of the final version of "Katamari Damacy" was exhibited at the 2003 <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> (TGS). The demo was critically praised by the press, with <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s <a href="Jeff%20Gerstmann">Jeff Gerstmann</a> a "good dose of weird fun". Sony expressed strong interest in pushing the game's release forward based on the TGS response, offering to handle the game's promotion in exchange. Sony advertised the game on numerous billboards and posters across Japan, and created an infamous television ad of a businessman, waiting for an appointment, rolling up office furniture and staff. The original prototype game's cover artwork featured the large red ball used in "tamakorogashi", but for the game's final release, Takahashi developed the game's cover art, showing a large katamari on the verge of rolling over a city, emphasizing the scale of the game.

The game was released in Japan on 18 March 2004, priced at about , roughly two-thirds of the cost of most major titles at the time. Namco had estimated that the game would sell over 500,000 units in Japan during its first year, and while the game did not make that metric, it had stayed as one of the top ten games sold in Japan through its first nine weeks on the market, with more than 100,000 units sold during that period, which was considered impressive for a new <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a>. The public reaction to the game was positive enough that Namco ordered a sequel by December 2004.

At this point, Namco had not considered any Western release for the game. "Katamari Damacy" was first shown in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> at the <a href="Experimental%20Gameplay%20Workshop">Experimental Gameplay Workshop</a> during the March 2004 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>. A group of Western developers from the <a href="International%20Game%20Developers%20Association">International Game Developers Association</a> had previously brought "<a href="Mojib-Ribbon">Mojib-Ribbon</a>" to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering "Katamari Damacy" as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as "electric", but were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release. Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called "Namco's snowball simulator", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at the 2004 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. By July 2004, Namco officially announced the game's in the United States in September 2004. The game was never officially released in Europe on the PlayStation 2, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases.

A high-definition remaster of the game, titled "Katamari Damacy Reroll", was released on the Nintendo Switch's <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">eShop</a> and on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on 7 December 2018. The game includes support for the Switch's gyro controls in addition to its traditional control scheme.

In <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, means "clump" or "clod" and "Damashii" is the <a href="rendaku">rendaku</a> form of which means "soul" or "spirit". Therefore, the phrase approximates to "clump soul". The two <a href="kanji">kanji</a> that form the name look similar (sharing the same right-side element <a href="wikt%3A%E9%AC%BC">鬼</a>), in a kind of visual <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a>. The name is officially <a href="transliteration">transliterated</a> as "Katamari Damacy" in most releases. In an interview with "Dengeki Online", producer <a href="Keita%20Takahashi">Keita Takahashi</a> said that when asked about the title, "It just popped into my head suddenly, and this is what it has been from the beginning."

The music in "Katamari Damacy" was widely hailed as imaginative and original (winning both <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s "Soundtrack of the Year 2004" awards) and was considered one of the game's best features. The soundtrack was released in Japan as "<a href="Music%20of%20the%20Katamari%20Damacy%20series%23Katamari%20Damacy">Katamari Fortissimo Damacy</a>". Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences (<a href="Shibuya-kei">Shibuya-kei</a>). Most of the tracks were composed by <a href="Yuu%20Miyake">Yuu Miyake</a>, and many feature vocals from popular <a href="J-pop">J-pop</a> singers, such as <a href="Yui%20Asaka">Yui Asaka</a> from the "<a href="Sukeban%20Deka%203">Sukeban Deka 3</a>" TV series, and <a href="anime">anime</a> <a href="voice%20actor">voice actor</a>s, including <a href="Nobue%20Matsubara">Nobue Matsubara</a> and <a href="Ado%20Mizumori">Ado Mizumori</a>. One track is sung and written by <a href="Charlie%20Kosei">Charlie Kosei</a>, composer of the "<a href="Lupin%20III">Lupin III</a>" soundtrack.

"Katamari Damacy" enjoyed moderate success in Japan. The game was sold at about two-thirds of the price of a new game at the time. It was the top selling game the week of its release with 32,000 units sold, and sold over 155,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2004. However, Namco originally estimated that over 500,000 units would be sold in Japan.

The game was not released in PAL territories such as Europe and Australia since publishers thought it was too "quirky" for these markets; however, <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> picked up both sequels, "<a href="We%20Love%20Katamari">We Love Katamari</a>"
and "<a href="Me%20%26amp%3B%20My%20Katamari">Me & My Katamari</a>", for release in Europe.

The North American release of the game was very well received by professional reviewers, was mentioned and praised on <a href="TechTV">TechTV</a>, and was a featured sidebar in the May 23, 2004, edition of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine. "Time" continued to praise the game in its November 22, 2004 "Best games of the year" special, calling it "the most unusual and original game to hit PlayStation2". Most retailers underestimated the demand for such a quirky game, and only purchased a few copies of this <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>; it rapidly sold out nationwide, with sales surpassing 120,000 units in North America. It also won the U.S. award for "Excellence in Game Design" at the 2005 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, and <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> awarded "Katamari Damacy" its "Best Innovation" prize in its <a href="G-Phoria">G-Phoria</a> of that year. "Katamari Damacy" was one of the recipients of the 2004 <a href="Good%20Design%20Award%20%28Japan%29">Good Design Award</a> in Japan, the first time a video game has won this award. In 2015, the game placed 13th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.

Although the game has rapidly achieved a cult following and has been praised by many reviewers, it also has its share of criticism. A common complaint is that the game is relatively short and repetitive—it can be completed in under ten hours, and the gameplay stays virtually the same all the way through. However, others, such as "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his EGM staff), argue that the game's limitations are made up for by its strengths: "Sure, you're basically doing the same thing each mission, but Katamari's elegant controls, killer soundtrack, and wicked humor make it perfectly suited for replay." As a well-executed, non-traditional game, "Katamari Damacy" has been influential in the game development community. Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by "Katamari": one example is "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20End%20of%20the%20World">The Wonderful End of the World</a>".

On July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the <a href="New%20York%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">New York Museum of Modern Art</a>, entitled "Century of the Child: Growing by Design". Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and "playthings" over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its "quirky manipulations of scale" that makes it accessible for all ages. Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc. Carlson Choi described the inclusion of "Katamari Damacy" to the exhibit as "a testament to the creative designs embodied in Namco Bandai's games ... in addition to being a validation of video games as a modern form of interactive art."

On November 29 the same year, the game was included in the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20in%20the%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">permanent collection of video games</a> of the Museum of Modern Art. Curator <a href="Paola%20Antonelli">Paola Antonelli</a> selected "Katamari Damacy" among the first fourteen games to be displayed in the museum, which was chosen according to a variety of criteria, including "visual quality, elegance of the code and design of playing behavior."

"Katamari Damacy" has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, , was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is <a href="self-reference">self-referential</a>, following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, "We Love Katamari" introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels. was released for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> in 2005 and 2006, featuring levels based on helping the animals of an island devastated by a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>.

"<a href="Beautiful%20Katamari">Beautiful Katamari</a>" () was an <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> title released in 2007 and 2008, following the Royal Family using katamaris to close up a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> created while the King was playing tennis. The newer console allowed for higher-resolution graphics and support for online network play, leaderboards, and downloadable content. While <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Wii">Wii</a> ports were planned for "Beautiful Katamari", these never were released. 

"<a href="Katamari%20Forever">Katamari Forever</a>" () was released for the PlayStation 3 internationally in 2009. "Katamari Forever" incorporates a mix of previous levels from the series, framed around the King trying to recover from <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a>, and new levels where the katamari is needed to repair the damage done by a rampaging "RoboKing". It further improved on the graphics capabilities of "Beautiful Katamari" and introduced new moves for the player.

The "No-Vita" moniker is a play on the Vita console name and the Japanese word "nobita", meaning "to lengthen or extend". While the core mechanics are similar to other games in the series, "Touch My Katamari" allows the player to use the rear touch pad on the Vita to temporarily stretch the katamari into an ovoid shape, allowing it to roll through narrow spaces or collect small objects.

Several mobile versions have also been released. "Rolling With Katamari" was released in Japan in 2007 for the Mitsubishi P904i series of phones, using their tilt-sensitive technology to let the player control the katamari. It was ported to J2ME for release in other countries. "<a href="Katamari%20Damacy%20Mobile">Katamari Damacy Mobile</a>" was released in 2009 for several wireless devices and is a 2D side-scrolling version of "Katamari Damacy" similar to a mini-mode included with "Me & My Katamari".

Something (Beatles song)

"Something" is a song by the English rock band <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> from their 1969 album "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>". It was written by <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, the band's lead guitarist. Soon after the album's release, the song was issued as a single, coupled with "<a href="Come%20Together">Come Together</a>", making it the first Harrison composition to become a Beatles A-side. Its pairing with "Come Together" was also the first time in the United Kingdom that the Beatles issued a single containing tracks that were already available on an album. The single topped the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> in the United States as well as charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and West Germany, and peaked at number 4 in the UK.

"Something" is widely viewed by music historians as having marked Harrison's ascendancy as a composer to the level of the Beatles' principal songwriters, <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. It is described as a love song to <a href="Pattie%20Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a>, Harrison's first wife, although Harrison offered alternative sources of inspiration in later interviews. Due to the difficulty he faced in getting more than two of his compositions onto each Beatles album, Harrison first offered "Something" to <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a>. As recorded by the Beatles, the track features a guitar solo that several music critics identify among Harrison's finest playing. The song also drew praise from the other Beatles and their producer, <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>, with Lennon stating that it was the best song on "Abbey Road". The promotional film for the single combined footage of each of the Beatles with their respective wife, reflecting the estrangement in the band during the months preceding the official announcement of <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">their break-up</a> in April 1970.

"Something" received the <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Award">Ivor Novello Award</a> for the "Best Song Musically and Lyrically" of 1969. Harrison subsequently performed the song at his <a href="Concert%20for%20Bangladesh">Concert for Bangladesh</a> shows in 1971 and throughout the two tours he made as a solo artist. Up to the late 1970s, it had been covered by over 150 artists, making it the second-most covered Beatles composition after "<a href="Yesterday%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Yesterday</a>". <a href="Shirley%20Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a> had a top-five UK hit with her 1970 recording, while <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> regularly performed the song. Other artists who have covered "Something" include <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="Peggy%20Lee">Peggy Lee</a>, <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>, <a href="Tony%20Bennett">Tony Bennett</a>, <a href="Andy%20Williams">Andy Williams</a>, <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a> and <a href="Ike%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner">Ike & Tina Turner</a>. In 1999, <a href="Broadcast%20Music%20Incorporated">Broadcast Music Incorporated</a> named "Something" as the 17th-most performed song of the twentieth century, with 5 million performances. In 2004, it was ranked at number 278 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>", while two years later, "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" placed it at number 7 in the magazine's list of the Beatles' best songs. A year after Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney and <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> performed it at the <a href="Concert%20for%20George">Concert for George</a> tribute at London's <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>.

<a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> began writing "Something" in September 1968, during a session for the Beatles' <a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">self-titled double album</a>, also known as "the White Album".<ref name="Lewisohn/Mojo Beatles Final Years">Mark Lewisohn, "Something Else", in "Mojo Special Limited Edition", p. 118.</ref> In his autobiography, "<a href="I%2C%20Me%2C%20Mine%20%28book%29">I, Me Mine</a>", he recalls working on the melody on a piano, at the same time as <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> recorded <a href="Overdubbing">overdubs</a> in a neighbouring studio at London's <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a>. Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In "I, Me, Mine", he wrote that the <a href="middle%20eight">middle eight</a> "took some time to sort out".
The opening lyric was taken from the title of "<a href="Something%20in%20the%20Way%20She%20Moves">Something in the Way She Moves</a>", a track by Harrison's fellow <a href="Apple%20Records">Apple Records</a> artist <a href="James%20Taylor">James Taylor</a>. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>, his inspiration for "Something" was his wife, <a href="Pattie%20Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a>. In her 2007 autobiography, "<a href="Wonderful%20Today">Wonderful Today</a>", Boyd recalls: "He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ..." Boyd discusses the song's popularity among other recording artists and concludes: "My favourite [version] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at <a href="Kinfauns%20%28Surrey%29">Kinfauns</a>."

Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track "<a href="Long%2C%20Long%2C%20Long">Long, Long, Long</a>", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for "Something". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the <a href="Hare%20Krishna%20Movement">Hare Krishna Movement</a> that the song was about the Hindu deity <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>; in an interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: "all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see." By 1996, Harrison had denied writing "Something" for Boyd. That year, he told music journalist <a href="Paul%20Cashmere">Paul Cashmere</a> that "everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie" because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed the couple together.
In the version issued on the Beatles' 1969 album "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>", which was the first release for the song, "Something" runs at a speed of around 66 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a> and is in <a href="common%20time">common time</a> throughout. It begins with a five-note guitar figure, which functions as the song's chorus, since it is repeated before each of the verses and also closes the track. The melody is in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="C%20major">C major</a> until the eight-measure-long <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, or middle eight, which is in the key of <a href="A%20major">A major</a>. Harrison biographer Simon Leng identifies "harmonic interest ... [in] almost every line" of the song, as the melody follows a series of descending half-steps from the <a href="Tonic%20%28music%29">tonic</a> over the verses, a structure that is then mirrored in the new key, through the middle eight. The melody returns to C major for the guitar solo, the third verse, and the <a href="Conclusion%20%28music%29">outro</a>.<ref name="Pollack/Something"></ref>

While Leng considers that, lyrically and musically, "Something" reflects "doubt and striving to attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to lines in the song's verses, Inglis writes: "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [Boyd] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I have to do is think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> describes "Something" as "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" written at a time "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".

Harrison first introduced "Something" at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968, when he played it to <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>'s stand-in as producer of "The Beatles", <a href="Chris%20Thomas%20%28record%20producer%29">Chris Thomas</a>, while the latter was working out the <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a> part for Harrison's track "<a href="Piggies">Piggies</a>". Despite Thomas's enthusiasm for the new composition, Harrison chose to focus on "Piggies". He told Thomas that he intended to offer "Something" to singer <a href="Jackie%20Lomax">Jackie Lomax</a>, whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records. "Something" was not among the tracks released on Lomax's album, however, much of which was recorded in Los Angeles following the completion of the White Album.

After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%23Concept">Get Back</a>" film project (later released as "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28film%29">Let It Be</a>"), "Something" was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group. Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter, comparing it with <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s peak of creativity over 1963–64, yet Harrison's songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense, uncooperative atmosphere within the band. Martin was also unimpressed by "Something" at first, considering it "too weak and derivative", according to music journalist <a href="Mikal%20Gilmore">Mikal Gilmore</a>.

The Beatles rehearsed the song at <a href="Apple%20Studio">Apple Studio</a> on 28 January. With the proceedings being recorded by director <a href="Michael%20Lindsay-Hogg">Michael Lindsay-Hogg</a> for the planned documentary film, tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for "Something" with Lennon and McCartney, since he had been unable to complete the song's second line, which begins "Attracts me ..." To serve as a temporary filler, Lennon suggested "like a cauliflower", which Harrison then altered to "like a pomegranate". In their study of the available tapes, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles gave the song two run-throughs that day, which was the only occasion that they attempted it during the "Get Back"/"Let It Be" project.

Following the Beatles' brief efforts with "Something" on 28 January, Harrison talked with Lennon and <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a> about recording a solo album of his unused songs, since he had already stockpiled enough compositions "for the next ten years", given his usual allocation of two tracks per album, and in order to "preserve this, the Beatle bit, more". Lennon offered his support for the idea, similarly keen that his and Ono's recording projects outside the Beatles could continue without jeopardising the band's future. On 25 February 1969 – his 26th birthday – Harrison entered Abbey Road Studios and taped solo <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> of "Something", "<a href="Old%20Brown%20Shoe">Old Brown Shoe</a>" and "<a href="All%20Things%20Must%20Pass%20%28song%29">All Things Must Pass</a>", the last two of which had also been rejected recently by Lennon and McCartney.

With <a href="Ken%20Scott">Ken Scott</a> serving as his engineer, he recorded a live take of "Something", featuring electric guitar and vocal. By this point, Harrison had completed the lyrics, although he included an extra verse, sung to a <a href="counter-melody">counter-melody</a>, over the section that would comprise his guitar solo on the Beatles' subsequent official recording. This demo version of "Something" remained unreleased until its inclusion on the Beatles' <a href="outtake">outtake</a> collection "<a href="Anthology%203">Anthology 3</a>" in 1996.

In March 1969, Harrison gave "Something" to <a href="Joe%20Cocker">Joe Cocker</a> to record, having decided that it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar examples where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying:

I think he was totally confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, "How many songs am I going to be able to get on each album?", and with the backlog sort of mounting up ... [to] get it out there, and get something from it.

Assisted by Harrison, Cocker recorded a demo of the song at Apple. While musicologist <a href="Walter%20Everett%20%28musicologist%29">Walter Everett</a> suggests that this was the same recording of "Something" that appeared on the "<a href="Joe%20Cocker%21">Joe Cocker!</a>" album in November 1969, Beatles historian <a href="Mark%20Lewisohn">Mark Lewisohn</a> writes that Cocker subsequently remade the track.

The Beatles undertook the recording of "Abbey Road" with a sense of discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and "Let It Be". Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 partly as a result of McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions "Something" and "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a>". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: "I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else ... It was a tremendous work – and so simple."

The group recorded "Something" on 16 April before Harrison decided to redo the song, a new basic track for which was then completed at Abbey Road on 2 May. The line-up was Harrison on <a href="Leslie%20speaker">Leslie</a>-effected rhythm guitar, Lennon on piano, McCartney on bass, <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> on drums, and guest musician <a href="Billy%20Preston">Billy Preston</a> playing <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a>. On 5 May, at <a href="Olympic%20Sound%20Studios">Olympic Sound Studios</a>, McCartney re-recorded his bass part and Harrison added lead guitar. At this point, the song ran to eight minutes, due to the inclusion of an extended <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> led by Lennon's piano.

After taking a break from recording, the band returned to "Something" on 11 July, when Harrison overdubbed what would turn out to be a temporary vocal. With the resulting <a href="Reduction%20mixing">reduction mix</a>, much of the coda, along with almost all of Lennon's playing on the main part of the song, was cut from the recording. The piano can be heard only in the middle eight, specifically during the descending run that follows each pair of "I don't know" vocal lines. On 16 July, Harrison recorded a new vocal, with McCartney overdubbing his harmony vocal over the middle eight and Starr adding both a second <a href="hi-hat">hi-hat</a> part and a cymbal.

Following another reduction mix, at which point the remainder of the coda was excised from the track, Martin-arranged string orchestration was overdubbed on 15 August, as Harrison, working in the adjacent studio at Abbey Road, re-recorded his lead guitar part live. Writing for "Rolling Stone" in 2002, <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> described the Beatles' version of "Something" as "actually two moods in one: the pillowy yearning of the verses ... and the golden thunder of the bridge, the latter driven by Ringo Starr's military flourish on a high-hat cymbal". Leng highlights Harrison's guitar solo on the recording as "a performance that is widely regarded as one of the great guitar solos", and one in which Harrison incorporates the <a href="Gamaka%20%28music%29">gamaks</a> associated with <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a>, following his study of the <a href="sitar">sitar</a> in 1965–68, while also foreshadowing the expressive style he would adopt on <a href="slide%20guitar">slide guitar</a> as a solo artist.

Apple Records issued "Abbey Road" on 26 September 1969, with "Something" sequenced as the second track, following Lennon's "<a href="Come%20Together">Come Together</a>". Lennon considered "Something" to be the best song on the album. Having ensured that "Old Brown Shoe" was chosen as the <a href="B-side">B-side</a> for the Beatles' single "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20John%20and%20Yoko">The Ballad of John and Yoko</a>", according to his later recollection, Lennon now pushed <a href="Allen%20Klein">Allen Klein</a> to release "Something" as a single from "Abbey Road". Coupled with "Come Together", the single was issued on 6 October in America (as Apple 2654) and 31 October in Britain (as Apple R5814).

The release marked the first time that a Harrison composition had been afforded A-side treatment on a Beatles single, as well as the only time during their career that a single was issued in the UK featuring tracks already available on an album. In a 1990 letter to Mark Lewisohn, Klein refuted a claim made by Lewisohn in his book "<a href="The%20Complete%20Beatles%20Recording%20Sessions">The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</a>", that the single was intended as a money-making exercise: Klein said it was purely a mark of Lennon's regard for "Something" and "to point out George as a writer, and give him courage to go in and do his own LP. Which he did." Following the Beatles' <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">break-up</a> in April 1970, Harrison's ascendancy as a songwriter would continue with his triple album "<a href="All%20Things%20Must%20Pass">All Things Must Pass</a>", building on the promise of White Album tracks such as "<a href="While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>" and his two contributions to "Abbey Road".

The promotional clip for "Something" was shot in late October 1969, not long after Lennon had privately announced that he was leaving the band. By this time, the individual Beatles had drawn apart and so the film consisted of separate clips of each Beatle walking around his home, accompanied by his wife, edited together. Harrison's segment shows him and Boyd together in the garden at Kinfauns; in author John Winn's description, Harrison appears "solemn" while Boyd is seen "smiling sweetly" and "sporting leather and fur coats". Winn also comments on the attractiveness of all the wives in contrast to the unkempt appearance of McCartney, especially, who had sunk into depression at the realisation that the Beatles were over. The four segments were edited and compiled into a single film clip by <a href="Neil%20Aspinall">Neil Aspinall</a>.<ref name="Kozinn/NYT"></ref> Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" following Aspinall's death in 2008, <a href="Allan%20Kozinn">Allan Kozinn</a> said: "What Mr. Aspinall's idyllic film avoided showing was that the Beatles were at that point barely on speaking terms. In the film, no two Beatles are seen together."

In 2015, following <a href="Film%20restoration">restoration</a> overseen by Apple's Jonathan Clyde, the "Something" promo film was included in the Beatles' video compilation "<a href="1%20%28Beatles%20album%29">1</a>" and its expanded edition, "1+". "Rolling Stone" journalist <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> comments on the significance of the clip, with regard to the band's history:

[E]ach couple projects a totally different vibe – George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko serene in their matching black robes. Each Beatle looks like he's found what he was looking for – but they're heading for four separate futures.
In her review of "1+", for "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>", Gillian Gaar says that with the Beatles' promotional films of their singles, from "<a href="Love%20Me%20Do">Love Me Do</a>" to "Something" (the last one they made during their career), "you can see the development of the promo clip, progressing from a short film that simply served up a straight performance to a piece of work that was striving to be something more artistic."

Although its commercial impact was lessened by the ongoing success of the parent album, "Something" / "Come Together" was certified <a href="Gold%20single">Gold</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) on 27 October. During the single's chart run on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" in the US, "Something" peaked at number 3 until the magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately for each song; following this change on 29 November, the single topped the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>,<ref name="Mapes/BB"></ref> for one week. "Come Together" / "Something" became the Beatles' eighteenth number 1 single in "Billboard", surpassing <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s record of seventeen. In the other US national charts, "<a href="Record%20World">Record World</a>" listed "Something" / "Come Together" at number 1 for two weeks and "Come Together" / "Something" for the remaining three weeks at number 1, while in "<a href="Cashbox%20%28magazine%29">Cash Box</a>" magazine, which continued to rank each song separately, "Something" peaked at number 2 and "Come Together" spent three weeks at number 1.

As the preferred side, "Something" was number 1 in Canada (for five weeks), Australia (five weeks), West Germany (two weeks), New Zealand and Singapore. The combined sides reached number 4 in Britain. There, the release was highly unusual, given the traditional preference for non-album singles. In addition, according to former "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" editor <a href="Paul%20Du%20Noyer">Paul Du Noyer</a>, "so enormous were sales of "Abbey Road" that demand for the single was inevitably dampened."

On 17 February 1999, "Something" was certified double <a href="Platinum%20single">Platinum</a> by the RIAA. In its 2014 list titled "The Beatles' 50 Biggest Billboard Hits", "Billboard" places the double A-side single in sixth place, immediately after "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28song%29">Let It Be</a>" and ahead of "<a href="Hello%2C%20Goodbye">Hello, Goodbye</a>". Additionally, "Something" is placed again at number 30, representing the song's performance before the November 1969 Hot 100 rule change.

Among contemporary reviews, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine declared "Something" to be the best track on "Abbey Road", while <a href="John%20Mendelsohn%20%28musician%29">John Mendelsohn</a> wrote in "Rolling Stone": "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." Writing in "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28U.S.%20magazine%29">Saturday Review</a>" magazine, Ellen Sander described "Something" as "certainly one of the most beautiful songs George Harrison has ever written" and added: "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." Lon Goddard of "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>" described the song as "another beautiful Harrison composition" in the style of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", saying that "It leaps scales in its heavy orchestral arrangement, then drifts down to George's simple but effective guitar style." In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the "<a href="NME">NME</a>" lauded the track as "a real quality hunk of pop" with a "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of "Something": "It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!"
Writing in his book "<a href="Revolution%20in%20the%20Head">Revolution in the Head</a>", author and critic <a href="Ian%20MacDonald">Ian MacDonald</a> described "Something" as "the acme of Harrison's achievement as a writer". MacDonald highlighted the song's "key-structure of classical grace and panoramic effect", and cited the lyrics to verse two as "its author's finest lines – at once deeper and more elegant than almost anything his colleagues [Lennon and McCartney] ever wrote".

Like Lennon, both McCartney and Starr held the song in high regard. In the 2000 book "<a href="The%20Beatles%20Anthology%20%28book%29">The Beatles Anthology</a>", Starr paired "Something" with "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" as "Two of the finest love songs ever written", adding, "they're really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote"; McCartney said it was "George's greatest track – with 'Here Comes the Sun' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'". Among Harrison's other peers, <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a> described "Something" as a "masterpiece" and <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> said: "'Something' is probably one of the best love songs ever, ever, "ever" written ... It's better than 'Yesterday,' much better ... It's like the song I've been chasing for the last thirty-five years."

In a 2002 article for "<a href="The%20Morning%20News%20%28online%20magazine%29">The Morning News</a>", <a href="Kenneth%20Womack">Kenneth Womack</a> included Harrison's guitar solo on the track among his "Ten Great Beatles Moments". Describing the instrumental break as "the song's greatest lyrical feature – even more lyrical, interestingly enough, than the lyrics themselves", Womack concluded: "A masterpiece in simplicity, Harrison's solo reaches toward the sublime, wrestles with it in a bouquet of downward syncopation, and hoists it yet again in a moment of supreme grace." "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" included the performance as the magazine's featured solo in June 2011. Later that year, "Something" was one of the two "key tracks" highlighted by "Rolling Stone" when the magazine placed Harrison at number 11 on its list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists".

In July 1970, "Something" received the <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Award">Ivor Novello Award</a> for "Best Song Musically and Lyrically" of 1969. In 2005, the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) named it as the 64th-greatest song ever. According to the BBC, the song "shows more clearly than any other song in The Beatles' canon that there were three great songwriters in the band rather than just two". The Beatles' official website states that "Something" "underlined the ascendance of George Harrison as a major songwriting force".

"Something" became the second most covered Beatles song after "<a href="Yesterday%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Yesterday</a>". By the end of the 1970s, over 150 artists had recorded the song. In 1999, <a href="Broadcast%20Music%20Incorporated">Broadcast Music Incorporated</a> (BMI) named "Something" as the 17th-most performed song of the twentieth century, with 5 million performances. In 2004, the track was ranked at number 278 on "Rolling Stone"s list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>". In 2010, "Something" appeared at number 6 on the magazine's "100 Greatest Beatles Songs" list. Four years before this, "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" placed it 7th in a similar list of the Beatles' best songs.<ref name="Mojo/101 Greatest"></ref>

Among the song's many cover versions, Welsh singer <a href="Shirley%20Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a> recorded a successful version of "Something". It was released in 1970 as the title track to her album <a href="Something%20%28Shirley%20Bassey%20album%29">of the same name</a>.<ref name="Bassey/AM"></ref> Also issued as a single, it became Bassey's first top-ten hit in the UK since "<a href="I%20%28Who%20Have%20Nothing%29">I (Who Have Nothing)</a>" in 1963, peaking at number 4 and spending 22 weeks on the chart. The single also reached the top twenty in other European countries and peaked at number 6 on "Billboard"s <a href="Adult%20Contemporary%20%28chart%29">Easy Listening</a> (later Adult Contemporary) chart.

Bassey said she had been unaware of the song's origins when recording "Something". She later suggested that she and Harrison could become a singer-and-songwriter pairing on the scale of <a href="Dionne%20Warwick">Dionne Warwick</a> and <a href="Burt%20Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a>. After reading these comments in 1970, Harrison wrote "<a href="When%20Every%20Song%20Is%20Sung">When Every Song Is Sung</a>" with Bassey in mind, although it was not a composition that she ever recorded.

<a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> was particularly impressed with "Something", calling it "the greatest love song of the past 50 years". According to Du Noyer, he "especially admired the way the lyric evokes a girl who isn't even present". Aside from performing "Something" numerous times in concert, Sinatra recorded the song twice: in October 1970 as a single for <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a> (a version that later appeared on "<a href="Frank%20Sinatra%27s%20Greatest%20Hits%2C%20Vol.%202">Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2</a>"), and for his 1980 triple album "". With the sides flipped to favour the B-side, "<a href="Bein%27%20Green">Bein' Green</a>", the 1970 single peaked at number 22 on "Billboard"s Easy Listening chart.

During his live performances, Sinatra was known to mistakenly introduce "Something" as a <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">Lennon–McCartney</a> composition. By 1978, however, he had begun correctly citing Harrison as its author. Harrison went on to adopt Sinatra's minor lyrical change (in the song's middle eight, singing "You stick around, Jack ...") in his live performances over 1991–92. In "The Beatles Anthology", Harrison says he viewed Sinatra as being part of "the generation before me" and so only later came to appreciate the American singer's adoption of the song.

Harrison's composition began accumulating cover versions almost immediately after the release of "Abbey Road". In addition to Joe Cocker, <a href="Peggy%20Lee">Peggy Lee</a> and <a href="Tony%20Bennett">Tony Bennett</a> each issued recordings of the song at the end of 1969. <a href="Lena%20Horne">Lena Horne</a> recorded "Something" in the <a href="jazz">jazz</a> style for her 1970 album with guitarist <a href="Gabor%20Szabo">Gabor Szabo</a>, titled "<a href="Lena%20%26amp%3B%20Gabor">Lena & Gabor</a>". An instrumental version by <a href="Booker%20T.%20%26amp%3B%20the%20M.G.%27s">Booker T. & the M.G.'s</a>, from their "Abbey Road" tribute album "<a href="McLemore%20Avenue">McLemore Avenue</a>", peaked at number 76 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in August 1970. Other artists who released covers of the song that year include <a href="Della%20Reese">Della Reese</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, <a href="Perry%20Como">Perry Como</a>, <a href="Karina%20%28Spanish%20singer%29">Karina</a>, <a href="Duane%20Eddy">Duane Eddy</a>, <a href="the%20Ray%20Conniff%20Singers">the Ray Conniff Singers</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Butler">Jerry Butler</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Mathis">Johnny Mathis</a>, <a href="Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28singer%29">Engelbert Humperdinck</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Hayes">Isaac Hayes</a>, <a href="King%20Curtis">King Curtis</a>, <a href="Martha%20Reeves%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Vandellas">Martha Reeves & the Vandellas</a>, <a href="Ferrante%20%26amp%3B%20Teicher">Ferrante & Teicher</a> and <a href="the%20Shadows">the Shadows</a>. Former <a href="Motown">Motown</a> recording artist <a href="Kim%20Weston">Kim Weston</a> included her version on her 1970 album "Big Brass Four Poster". Ray Charles issued his version on the album "<a href="Volcanic%20Action%20of%20My%20Soul">Volcanic Action of My Soul</a>" in 1971, the same year that recordings appeared by <a href="Andy%20Williams">Andy Williams</a> and <a href="Junior%20Walker%20%26amp%3B%20the%20All%20Stars">Junior Walker & the All Stars</a>, while <a href="Buddy%20Rich">Buddy Rich</a>, <a href="Blue%20Mink">Blue Mink</a> and <a href="Ike%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner">Ike & Tina Turner</a> were among the acts who covered it in 1972. Referring to the song's popularity among easy-listening artists, Harrison later said: "When even <a href="Liberace">Liberace</a> covered it [in 1970], you know that it's one of them that ends up in an elevator ..."<ref name="Ellen/Q"></ref>
"Something" was one of the rare Beatles songs that Elvis Presley chose to play, when he introduced it into the setlist for his third season at the <a href="Westgate%20Las%20Vegas%20Resort%20%26amp%3B%20Casino">International Hotel</a> in Las Vegas, in August 1970. He also performed it on his 1973 "<a href="Aloha%20from%20Hawaii">Aloha from Hawaii</a>" TV special, the recording from which appeared on the accompanying <a href="Aloha%20from%20Hawaii%20Via%20Satellite%20%28album%29">bestselling album</a>. A live version from the 1970 Las Vegas concerts subsequently appeared on the Presley box sets "" (1995) and "<a href="Live%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20%28Elvis%20Presley%20album%29">Live in Las Vegas</a>" (2001). In 1974, a recording by <a href="Johnny%20Rodriguez">Johnny Rodriguez</a> reached number 6 on "Billboard"s <a href="Hot%20Country%20Songs">Hot Country Singles</a> chart and number 85 on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song peaked at number 11 on the "<a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">RPM</a>" country chart.

Other versions of "Something" include recordings by <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>, <a href="Peggy%20Lee">Peggy Lee</a>, <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>, <a href="Julio%20Iglesias">Julio Iglesias</a>, <a href="James%20Booker">James Booker</a> and <a href="Musiq%20Soulchild">Musiq Soulchild</a>. Harrison referred to James Brown's recording as his favourite cover of the song, saying: "It was one of his B sides. I have it on my jukebox at home. It's absolutely brilliant." In 1995, <a href="Tanya%20Tucker">Tanya Tucker</a> recorded the song for the album "".

<a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> opened his first show after Harrison's death on 29 November 2001 by playing an acoustic version of "Something" with violinist <a href="Soozie%20Tyrell">Soozie Tyrell</a>, followed by a rendition of Harrison's solo hit "<a href="My%20Sweet%20Lord">My Sweet Lord</a>". Elton John gave a solo performance of the song at New York's <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in April 2002, as part of a one-hour Harrison tribute during the eleventh annual <a href="Rainforest%20Foundation%20US">Rainforest Foundation</a> concert.

In honour of Harrison's fondness for the instrument, Paul McCartney played a ukulele rendition of "Something" throughout his 2002–03 world tour and included the track on his "<a href="Back%20in%20the%20U.S.">Back in the U.S.</a>" live album. At the <a href="Concert%20for%20George">Concert for George</a>, held at London's <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> on 29 November 2002, he and <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> performed a version that begins with McCartney alone, on ukulele, and then reverts to the familiar, rock arrangement, with Clapton taking over as lead singer and backing from Starr, Preston and others. Following its appearance in <a href="David%20Leland">David Leland</a>'s film "<a href="Concert%20for%20George%20%28film%29">Concert for George</a>" (2003) and on the accompanying <a href="Concert%20for%20George%20%28album%29">live album</a>, this performance of "Something" was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals</a>. <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> also played the song live during his November 2002 concerts, as a tribute to Harrison. McCartney has continued to perform "Something", adopting the Concert for George mix of ukulele and rock backing; a version with this musical arrangement was included on his 2009 album "<a href="Good%20Evening%20New%20York%20City">Good Evening New York City</a>".

Harrison played "Something" at the two <a href="Concert%20for%20Bangladesh">Concert for Bangladesh</a> shows, held at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York on 1 August 1971. His first live performance as a solo artist, he was backed by a large band that included Starr, Preston, Clapton and <a href="Leon%20Russell">Leon Russell</a>. The version used on the <a href="The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%20%28album%29">live album</a> and in the 1972 <a href="The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%20%28film%29">concert film</a> was taken from the evening show that day, when Harrison played it as the final song before returning to perform "<a href="Bangla%20Desh%20%28song%29">Bangla Desh</a>" as an encore.

Harrison included "Something" in all of his subsequent, and rare, full-length concert appearances. For his 1974 North American tour with <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>, he had been reluctant to feature any material from the Beatles' catalogue, but at the urging of Shankar and Preston during rehearsals, he added "Something" to the setlist. To the disappointment of many fans, however, he chose to alter some of the song's lyrics (such as changing the first line to "If there's something in the way, remove it"). Further distancing himself from the Beatles' legacy, Harrison told journalists at the start of the tour that he would join a group with Lennon "any day" but rejected the idea of working again with McCartney, since he preferred <a href="Willie%20Weeks">Willie Weeks</a> as a bassist. MacDonald comments that this statement was likely in reference to McCartney's "too fussily extemporised" bass part on the Beatles' 1969 recording. With Boyd having left Harrison for Clapton earlier in 1974, <a href="Larry%20Sloman">Larry Sloman</a> of "Rolling Stone" described the reworked "Something" as "a moving diary of his love life".

A version from Harrison's December 1991 tour of Japan with Clapton – Harrison's only other tour as a solo artist – appears on the "<a href="Live%20in%20Japan%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29">Live in Japan</a>" double album (1992). Inglis writes of the track having "extra poignancy" by this time, "in that the woman for whom it was written had been married to, and divorced from, Harrison and Clapton in turn". Inglis adds: "It is not a new interpretation of the song, but it does suggest a new perspective, in which words and music are used by two close friends to reflect on the lives they have led."

War of the League of Cambrai

The War of the League of Cambrai, sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names, was a major conflict in the <a href="Italian%20Wars">Italian Wars</a>. The main participants of the war, fought from 1508 to 1516, were <a href="Early%20modern%20France">France</a>, the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>; they were joined, at various times, by nearly every significant power in <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>, including <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Duchy of Milan</a>, <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Ferrara">Duchy of Ferrara</a> and <a href="Swiss%20mercenaries">Swiss mercenaries</a>.

<a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a>, intending to curb Venetian influence in northern <a href="History%20of%20Italy%20during%20foreign%20domination%20and%20the%20unification">Italy</a>, had created the League of Cambrai, an anti-Venetian alliance consisting of himself, <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII</a> of France, <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II</a> of Aragon and <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, the Holy Roman Emperor. Although the League was initially successful, friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France.

The Veneto–Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about the division of the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a>, who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Marignano">Marignano</a> in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of <a href="Noyon">Noyon</a> and <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20Italian%20War">First Italian War</a>, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20VI">Pope Alexander VI</a> had, with French assistance, moved to consolidate Papal control over central <a href="Italy">Italy</a> by seizing the <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a>. <a href="Cesare%20Borgia">Cesare Borgia</a>, acting as <a href="Gonfalonier%20of%20the%20Church">Gonfalonier of the Papal armies</a>, had expelled the <a href="House%20of%20Bentivoglio">Bentivoglio</a> family from <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, which they had ruled as a <a href="fief">fief</a>, and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on 18 August 1503. Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use, he was unable to secure Rome itself, as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the <a href="Papal%20conclave">Papal conclave</a>; the election of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20III">Pius III</a> (who soon died, to be replaced by <a href="Julius%20II">Julius II</a>) stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men-at-arms. Sensing Cesare's weakness, the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions; the Venetian Senate accepted and had taken possession of <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a>, <a href="Faenza">Faenza</a> and a number of other cities by the end of 1503.

Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Rome and later in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. The Republic of Venice, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with <a href="France">France</a> and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> against Venice; the death of <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a> and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance, but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities. Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>, which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi-independence.

In 1507, Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands; once again rebuffed by the Senate, he encouraged <a href="Emperor%20Maximilian%20I">Emperor Maximilian I</a> to attack the Republic. Maximilian, using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext, entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, but was defeated by a Venetian army under <a href="Bartolomeo%20d%27Alviano">Bartolomeo d'Alviano</a>. A second assault by a <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrolean</a> force several weeks later was an even greater failure; Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also seized <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> and <a href="Fiume">Fiume</a>, forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice.

Julius, humiliated by the failure of the Imperial invasion, turned to <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII of France</a> (who, having been left in possession of <a href="Milan">Milan</a> after the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War">Second Italian War</a>, was interested in further expansion into Italy) with an offer of alliance. In mid-March, the Republic provided a pretext for an attack on itself by appointing her own candidate to the vacant <a href="bishopric%20of%20Vicenza">bishopric of Vicenza</a> (an act in keeping with prevailing custom, though Julius considered it a personal provocation); the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire and <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand I of Spain</a> concluded the League of <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> against the Republic. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining <a href="Istria">Istria</a>, would receive <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, Vicenza, <a href="Padua">Padua</a> and the <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a>; France would annex <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>, <a href="Crema%2C%20Italy">Crema</a>, <a href="Bergamo">Bergamo</a> and <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a> to its Milanese possessions; Ferdinand would seize <a href="Otranto">Otranto</a>; and the remainder, including <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a> and <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, would be added to the Papal States.

On 15 April 1509, Louis left Milan at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory. To oppose him, Venice had hired a <a href="condottiere">condottiere</a> army under the command of the <a href="Orsini">Orsini</a> cousins – Bartolomeo d'Alviano and <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20di%20Pitigliano">Niccolò di Pitigliano</a> – but had failed to account for their disagreement on how best to stop the French advance. Consequently, when Louis crossed the <a href="Adda%20River">Adda River</a> in early May and Alviano advanced to meet him, Pitigliano, believing it best to avoid a pitched battle, moved away to the south. On 14 May, Alviano confronted the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agnadello">Battle of Agnadello</a>; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way. Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed. Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano's defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to <a href="Treviso">Treviso</a> with the remnants of the Venetian army.

The Venetian collapse was complete. Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance; the Venetians lost all the territory that they had accumulated in northern Italy during the previous century. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French—Padua, Verona and Vicenza—were left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto. Julius, having in the meantime issued an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and seized Ravenna with the assistance of <a href="Alfonso%20I%20d%27Este">Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara</a>. D'Este, having joined the League and been appointed <a href="Gonfalonier%20of%20the%20Church">Gonfalonier</a> on 19 April, seized the <a href="Polesine">Polesine</a> for himself.

The newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular. In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the <a href="proveditor">proveditor</a> <a href="Andrea%20Gritti">Andrea Gritti</a>, revolted. The <a href="landsknechts">landsknechts</a> garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance, and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July 1509. The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from <a href="Trento">Trento</a> into the Veneto. Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian's forces would not reach Padua until September, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city. The <a href="Siege%20of%20Padua">Siege of Padua</a> began on 15 September 1509; although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua's walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on 30 September and withdrew to <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> with the main part of his army.

In mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive; Venetian troops easily defeated the remaining Imperial forces, capturing Vicenza, <a href="Este%2C%20Veneto">Este</a>, <a href="Feltre">Feltre</a> and <a href="Belluno">Belluno</a>. Although a subsequent attack on Verona failed, Pitigliano destroyed a Papal army under <a href="Francesco%20II%20of%20Gonzaga">Francesco II of Gonzaga</a> in the process. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Polesella">Battle of Polesella</a>, a river attack on <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> by the Venetian <a href="galley">galley</a> fleet under <a href="Angelo%20Trevisan">Angelo Trevisan</a> failed, however, when the Venetian ships anchored in the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a> were sunk by Ferrarese artillery. <a href="Francesco%20Guicciardini">Francesco Guicciardini</a> credited the decisive victory to Alfonso himself. A new French advance soon forced Pitigliano to withdraw to Padua once again.

Faced with a shortage of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for <a href="absolution">absolution</a>, however, the <a href="Council%20of%20Ten">Council of Ten</a> had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.

This apparent reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French from again invading the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's death in January had left <a href="Andrea%20Gritti">Andrea Gritti</a> in command of the Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, more concerned by the death of his advisor, the <a href="Cardinal%20d%27Amboise">Cardinal d'Amboise</a>, abandoned his plans for a siege.

Julius, meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy; more significantly, alienated from Alfonso d'Este by friction over a licence for a salt monopoly in the Papal states and Alfonso's continued forays against Venetian forces to secure his recently reacquired Polesine, he had formulated plans to seize the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Ferrara">Duchy of Ferrara</a>, a French ally, and to add its territory to the Papal States. His own forces being inadequate for the venture, the Pope hired an army of <a href="Swiss%20mercenaries">Swiss mercenaries</a>, ordering them to attack the French in Milan; he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis. The Republic, facing a renewed French onslaught, readily accepted the offer.

By July 1510, the new Veneto-Papal alliance was on the offensive. An initial attack on French-occupied <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> failed, but Venetian troops under <a href="Lucio%20Malvezzo">Lucio Malvezzo</a> finally drove the French from <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a> in early August; and a joint force commanded by <a href="Francesco%20Maria%20I%20della%20Rovere">Francesco Maria della Rovere</a>, the Duke of <a href="Urbino">Urbino</a>, captured <a href="Modena">Modena</a> on 17 August. Julius now <a href="excommunication">excommunicated</a> <a href="Alfonso%20d%27Este">Alfonso d'Este</a>, thus justifying an attack on the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Ferrara">Duchy</a> itself; in anticipation of his coming victory, the Pope traveled to <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken.

The French army, however, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having arrived in Lombardy, had been bribed into leaving by Louis) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy. In early October, <a href="Charles%20II%20d%27Amboise">Charles II d'Amboise</a> advanced on Bologna, splitting the Papal forces; by 18 October, he was only a few miles from the city. Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry, he resorted to excommunicating d'Amboise, who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara.
In December, a newly assembled Papal army conquered <a href="Concordia%20sulla%20Secchia">Concordia</a> and, in December, <a href="siege%20of%20Mirandola%20%281511%29">besieged the fortress of Mirandola</a>; d'Amboise, marching to relieve the latter, fell ill and died, briefly leaving the French in disarray. Mirandola fell in January 1511, the pope having taken personal command of the assault; but d'Amboise had been replaced by <a href="Gian%20Giacomo%20Trivulzio">Gian Giacomo Trivulzio</a>, who took back Concordia and <a href="Castelfranco%20nell%27Emilia">Castelfranco</a>, while the Papal army retreated to <a href="Casalecchio">Casalecchio</a>. Alfonso d'Este, meanwhile, confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a>, leaving Bologna isolated once more. Julius, afraid of being trapped by the French, departed the city for Ravenna. <a href="Francesco%20Alidosi">Cardinal Francesco Alidosi</a>, whom he left behind to command the defense of the city, was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been; and when, on 23 May 1511, a French army commanded by Trivulzio arrived at the gates, they quickly surrendered. Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino, who, finding this quite unfair, proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard.

By June 1511, most of the Romagna was in French hands; the Papal army, disorganized and underpaid, was in no condition to prevent Trivulzio from advancing on Ravenna. In response to this debacle, Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France. The new alliance rapidly grew to include not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire (which abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Iberian%20Navarre%23Background">seizing Navarre</a> from <a href="Catherine%20of%20Navarre">Queen Catherine</a> and Lombardy from Louis), but also <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> who, having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France, concluded the Treaty of Westminster—a pledge of mutual aid against the French—with Ferdinand on 17 November 1511.

In February 1512, Louis appointed his nephew, <a href="Gaston%20of%20Foix%2C%20Duke%20of%20Nemours">Gaston de Foix</a>, to command the French forces in Italy. Foix proved more energetic than Amboise had been; having checked the advance of <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20de%20Cardona">Ramón de Cardona</a>'s Spanish troops on Bologna, he returned to Lombardy to <a href="Sack%20of%20Brescia">sack Brescia</a>, which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops. Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion, Foix and Alfonso d'Este besieged <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna, in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement. Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April, and was decisively beaten in the resulting <a href="Battle%20of%20Ravenna%20%281512%29">Battle of Ravenna</a>, fought on Easter Sunday; the death of Foix during the fighting, however, left the French under the command of <a href="Jacques%20de%20la%20Palice">Jacques de la Palice</a>, who, unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis, contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna.

By May 1512, the French position had deteriorated considerably. Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries; they descended on Milan, bringing with them <a href="Maximilian%20Sforza">Maximilian Sforza</a>, who was determined to regain control of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Duchy</a> for his family. The French garrisons abandoned the Romagna (where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and <a href="Parma">Parma</a>) and retreated to Lombardy, attempting to intercept the invasion. By August, the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Trivulzio out of Milan, allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support; La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps.

In late August, the members of the League met at <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> to discuss the situation in Italy (particularly the partition of territory acquired from the French). They quickly came to an agreement regarding <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the <a href="Fifth%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Council of Pisa</a> in its territory. At the Pope's request, Ramon de Cardona marched into <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, smashed Florentine resistance, overthrew the Republic and installed <a href="Giuliano%20di%20Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Giuliano de' Medici</a> as ruler of the city.

On the subject of territory, however, fundamental disagreements quickly arose. Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan; Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand conspired instead to have one of their cousins installed as duke. The Pope demanded the immediate annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States; Ferdinand objected to this arrangement, desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power. Most problematic, however, was the attitude of Maximilian towards Venice. The Emperor refused to surrender any Imperial territory, which in his eyes included most of the Veneto, to the Republic; to this end, he signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition. When the Republic objected, Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her. In response, Venice turned to Louis; on 23 March 1513, a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at <a href="Blois">Blois</a>.

In late May 1513, a French army commanded by <a href="Louis%20de%20la%20Tr%C3%A9moille">Louis de la Trémoille</a> crossed the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and advanced on Milan; at the same time, Bartolomeo d'Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua. The unpopularity of <a href="Maximilian%20Sforza">Maximilian Sforza</a>, who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries, enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance; Trémoille, having seized Milan, besieged the remaining Swiss in <a href="Novara">Novara</a>. On 6 June, the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Novara%20%281513%29">Battle of Novara</a>, and were routed despite having superior numbers. Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a> before being bribed into withdrawing.

The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of continuous defeats for the French alliance. English troops under <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> besieged <a href="Th%C3%A9rouanne">Thérouanne</a>, defeated La Palice at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guinegate%20%281513%29">Battle of the Spurs</a>, and captured <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>. In Navarre, resistance to Ferdinand's invasion collapsed; he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the <a href="Guyenne">Guyenne</a>. <a href="James%20IV%20of%20Scotland">James IV of Scotland</a> invaded England at the behest of Louis; but he failed to draw Henry's attention from France, and his death—and the Scots' catastrophic defeat—at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Flodden">Battle of Flodden</a> on 9 September 1513, ended <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s brief involvement in the war.

Meanwhile, Alviano, unexpectedly left without French support, retreated into the Veneto, pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona. While the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance, they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of <a href="Venice">Venice</a> itself. Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective; then, having no boats with which to cross the lagoon, turned back for Lombardy. Alviano, having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility, pursued Cardona and confronted him outside <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a> on 7 October. In the resulting <a href="Battle%20of%20La%20Motta%20%281513%29">Battle of La Motta</a>, the Venetian army was decisively defeated, with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee.

However, the Holy League failed to follow up on these victories. Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a> for the rest of 1513 and through 1514, fighting several inconclusive battles, but Cardona was unable to make any real progress. Henry VIII, having failed to gain any significant territory, concluded a separate peace with France. Finally, the death of Julius left the League without a leader; Julius' successor to the Papacy, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Leo X</a>, was rather less concerned with military matters.

The death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 brought <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> to the throne. Having assumed the title of <a href="Duke%20of%20Milan">Duke of Milan</a> at his coronation, Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy. By July, Francis had assembled an army in the <a href="Dauphin%C3%A9">Dauphiné</a>. A combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him, but Francis, following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the <a href="Stura">Stura</a>. The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at <a href="Villafranca%20Piemonte">Villafranca</a>, capturing <a href="Prospero%20Colonna%20%28condottiero%29">Prospero Colonna</a>; meanwhile, Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marignano">Battle of Marignano</a> on 13 September. The Swiss advance initially made headway; however, Francis's superiority in cavalry and artillery, together with the timely arrival of Alviano (who had successfully avoided Cardona's army at <a href="Verona">Verona</a>) on the morning of 14 September, led to a strategically decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians.

After the defeat at Marignano, the League no longer possessed the ability or the will to continue the war. Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on 4 October and removing <a href="Maximilian%20Sforza">Sforza</a> from the throne. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his <a href="Swiss%20mercenaries">Swiss mercenaries</a>, surrendered <a href="Parma">Parma</a> and <a href="Piacenza">Piacenza</a> to Francis and <a href="Modena">Modena</a> to the <a href="Duke%20of%20Ferrara">Duke of Ferrara</a>. In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Urbino">Duchy of Urbino</a>. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war.

Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a>), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the <a href="Italian%20War%20of%201521%E2%80%9326">Italian War of 1521–26</a>. The <a href="Italian%20Wars">Italian Wars</a>, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.

Third Servile War

The Third Servile War, also called by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> the Gladiator War and The War of Spartacus, was the last in a series of <a href="slave%20revolt">slave rebellions</a> against the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, known collectively as the <a href="Servile%20Wars">Servile Wars</a>. The Third was the only one directly to threaten the Roman heartland of <a href="Italia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Italia</a>. It was particularly alarming to Rome because its military seemed powerless to suppress it.

The revolt began in 73 BC, with the escape of around 70 <a href="Gladiator%23The%20gladiators">slave-gladiators</a> from a <a href="Gladiator%23Schools%20and%20training">gladiator school</a> in <a href="Capua">Capua</a>; they easily defeated the small Roman force sent to recapture them. Within two years, they had been joined by some 120,000 men, women and children; the able-bodied adults of this band were a surprisingly effective armed force that repeatedly showed they could withstand or defeat the Roman military, from the local <a href="Campania">Campania</a>n patrols, to the Roman <a href="militia">militia</a>, and to trained <a href="Roman%20legion">Roman legion</a>s under <a href="consul">consul</a>ar command. The slaves wandered throughout Italia, raiding estates and towns with relative impunity, sometimes dividing their forces into separate but allied bands under the guidance of several leaders, including the famous gladiator-general <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a>.

The <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> grew increasingly alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded an army of eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus, and the realization that the legions of <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Magnus">Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Terentius%20Varro%20Lucullus">Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus</a> were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the <a href="Appian%20Way">Appian Way</a>.

Plutarch's account of the revolt suggests that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>. <a href="Appian">Appian</a> and <a href="Florus">Florus</a> describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their subsequent actions as Consuls greatly furthered the <a href="political%20subversion">subversion</a> of Roman political institutions and contributed to the eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

To varying degrees throughout <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman history</a>, the existence of a pool of inexpensive labor in the form of <a href="slaves">slaves</a> was an important factor in the <a href="economy">economy</a>. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the enslavement of foreign populations through military conquest. With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands of slaves at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers of slaves worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and southern Italy.

For the most part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the <a href="Roman%20republic">Roman republic</a>an period. Under Republican law, a slave was not considered a person, but property. Owners could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades who worked in the fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.

This high concentration and oppressive treatment of the slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the <a href="First%20Servile%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Servile%20War">Second</a> Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found tens of thousands of willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious <a href="Civil%20disorder">civil disturbances</a> by the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. This would all change with the Third Servile War.

In the Roman Republic of the 1st century BC, <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial games were one of the more popular forms of entertainment. In order to supply gladiators for the contests, several training schools, or "ludi", were established throughout Italy. In these schools, prisoners of war and condemned criminals—who were considered <a href="Slavery%20in%20antiquity">slaves</a>—were taught the skills required to fight in gladiatorial games. In 73 BC, a group of some 200 <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>s in the <a href="Capua">Capua</a>n school owned by <a href="Lentulus%20Batiatus">Lentulus Batiatus</a> plotted an escape. When their plot was betrayed, a force of about 70 men seized kitchen implements ("choppers and spits"), fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.

Once free, the escaped gladiators chose leaders from their number, selecting two Gallic slaves—<a href="Crixus">Crixus</a> and <a href="Oenomaus%20%28rebel%20slave%29">Oenomaus</a>—and <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a>, who was said either to be a <a href="Thracians">Thracian</a> <a href="Auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliary</a> from the <a href="Roman%20legion">Roman legion</a>s later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions. There is some question as to Spartacus's nationality. A "<a href="Thraex">Thraex</a>" was a type of gladiator in Rome, so "Thracian" may simply refer to the style of gladiatorial combat in which he was trained.

These escaped slaves were able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from <a href="Capua">Capua</a>, and equip themselves with captured military equipment as well as their gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators <a href="plunder">plunder</a>ed the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on <a href="Mount%20Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a>.

As the revolt and raids were occurring in <a href="Campania">Campania</a>, which was a vacation region of the rich and influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly came to the attention of Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt as more a major <a href="crime">crime wave</a> than an armed rebellion.

However, later that year, Rome dispatched a military force under <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ian authority to put down the rebellion. A Roman <a href="praetor">praetor</a>, <a href="Gaius%20Claudius%20Glaber">Gaius Claudius Glaber</a>, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not regular <a href="Roman%20legion">legion</a>s, but a <a href="militia">militia</a> "picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery." Glaber's forces besieged the slaves on <a href="Mount%20Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a>, blocking the only known way down the mountain. With the slaves thus contained, Glaber was content to wait until starvation forced the slaves to surrender.

While the slaves lacked military training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity in their use of available local materials, and in their use of clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to <a href="rappel">rappel</a> down the cliffs on the side of the mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.

A second expedition, under the <a href="praetor">praetor</a> <a href="Publius%20Varinius">Publius Varinius</a>, was then dispatched against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius seems to have split his forces under the command of his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.

With these successes, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did "many of the <a href="herder">herdsmen</a> and <a href="shepherd">shepherd</a>s of the region", swelling their ranks to some 70,000. The rebel slaves spent the winter of 73–72 BC training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of <a href="Nola">Nola</a>, <a href="Nocera%20Inferiore">Nuceria</a>, <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> and <a href="Metapontum">Metapontum</a>.

The victories of the rebel slaves did not come without a cost. At some time during these events, one of their leaders, <a href="Oenomaus%20%28rebel%20slave%29">Oenomaus</a>, was lost—presumably in battle—and is not mentioned further in the histories.

By the end of 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were in command of a large group of armed men with a proven ability to withstand Roman armies. What they intended to do with this force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.

Many popular modern accounts of the war claim that there was a factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that <a href="Florus">Florus</a> lists as being raided by the slaves include <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> and <a href="Metapontum">Metapontum</a>, which are geographically distant from <a href="Nola">Nola</a> and <a href="Nocera%20Inferiore">Nuceria</a>.

This indicates the existence of two groups: <a href="Lucius%20Gellius%20Publicola">Lucius Gellius Publicola</a> eventually attacked Crixus and a group of some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there does not seem to be any direct evidence to support it.

Fictional accounts sometimes portray the rebelling slaves as ancient Roman <a href="freedom%20fighter">freedom fighter</a>s, struggling to change a corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions that the goal of the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.

Even classical historians, who were writing only years after the events themselves, seem to be divided as to what the motives of Spartacus were. <a href="Appian">Appian</a> and <a href="Florus">Florus</a> write that he intended to march on Rome itself—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a> and disperse his men back to their homes.

It is not certain that the slaves were a homogeneous group under the leadership of Spartacus, although this is implied by the Roman historians. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.

In the spring of 72 BC, the escaped slaves left their winter encampments and began to move northwards towards <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>.

The Senate, alarmed by the size of the revolt and the defeat of the <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ian armies of <a href="Gaius%20Claudius%20Glaber">Glaber</a> and <a href="Publius%20Varinius">Varinius</a>, dispatched a pair of <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a>ar <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a> under the command of <a href="Lucius%20Gellius%20Publicola">Lucius Gellius Publicola</a> and <a href="Gnaeus%20Cornelius%20Lentulus%20Clodianus">Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus</a>. Initially, the consular armies were successful. <a href="Lucius%20Gellius%20Publicola">Gellius</a> engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of <a href="Crixus">Crixus</a>, near <a href="Gargano">Mount Garganus</a> and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.

At this point, there is a divergence in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by <a href="Appian">Appian</a> and <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.

According to Appian, the battle between Gellius' legions and Crixus' men near Mount Garganus was the beginning of a long and complex series of military maneuvers that almost resulted in the Spartacan forces directly assaulting the city of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> itself.

After his victory over Crixus, Gellius moved northwards, following the main group of slaves under <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a> who were heading for <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>. The army of <a href="Gnaeus%20Cornelius%20Lentulus%20Clodianus">Lentulus</a> was deployed to bar Spartacus' path, and the consuls hoped to trap the rebel slaves between them. Spartacus' army met Lentulus' legion, defeated it, turned, and destroyed Gellius' army, forcing the Roman legions to retreat in disarray.

Appian claims that Spartacus executed some 300 captured Roman soldiers to avenge the death of <a href="Crixus">Crixus</a>, forcing them to fight each other to the death as gladiators. Following this victory, Spartacus pushed northwards with his followers (some 120,000) as fast as he could travel, "having burned all his useless material, killed all his prisoners, and butchered his pack-animals in order to expedite his movement".

The defeated consular armies fell back to Rome to regroup while Spartacus' followers moved northward. The consuls again engaged Spartacus somewhere in the <a href="Picenum">Picenum</a> region, and once again were defeated.

Appian claims that at this point Spartacus changed his intention of marching on Rome—implying this was Spartacus' goal following the confrontation in Picenum—as "he did not consider himself ready as yet for that kind of a fight, as his whole force was not suitably armed, for no city had joined him, but only slaves, deserters, and riff-raff", and decided to withdraw into southern Italy once again. They seized the town of <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> and the surrounding countryside, arming themselves, raiding the surrounding territories, trading plunder with merchants for bronze and iron (with which to manufacture more arms), and clashing occasionally with Roman forces which were invariably defeated.

Plutarch's description of events differs significantly from Appian's.

According to Plutarch, after the battle between Gellius' legion and Crixus's men (whom Plutarch describes as "Germans") near Mount Garganus, Spartacus' men engaged the legion commanded by Lentulus, defeated them, seized their supplies and equipment, and pushed directly into northern Italy. After this defeat, both consuls were relieved of command of their armies by the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> and recalled to Rome. Plutarch does not mention Spartacus engaging Gellius' legion at all, nor of Spartacus facing the combined consular legions in Picenum.

Plutarch then goes on to detail a conflict not mentioned in Appian's history. According to Plutarch, Spartacus' army continued northwards to the region around Mutina (modern <a href="Modena">Modena</a>). There, a Roman army of some 10,000 soldiers, led by the governor of <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>, <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus%202">Gaius Cassius Longinus</a> attempted to bar Spartacus' progress and was also defeated.

Plutarch makes no further mention of events until the initial confrontation between <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> and Spartacus in the spring of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC.

Why they might do so, when there was apparently no reason for them not to escape over the Alps—Spartacus' goal according to Plutarch—is not explained.

Despite the contradictions in the classical sources regarding the events of 72 BC, there seems to be general agreement that Spartacus and his followers were in the south of Italy in early 71 BC.

The Senate, now alarmed at the apparently unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave the task of putting down the rebellion to <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>. Crassus was no stranger to Roman politics, or to military command as he had been a field commander under <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> during the <a href="Sulla%27s%20second%20civil%20war">second civil war</a> between Sulla and the <a href="Gaius%20Marius">Marian faction</a> in 82 BC, and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.

Crassus was given a <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ship, and assigned six new legions in addition to the two formerly consular legions of <a href="Lucius%20Gellius%20Publicola">Gellius</a> and <a href="Gnaeus%20Cornelius%20Lentulus%20Clodianus">Lentulus</a>, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit <a href="Decimation%20%28Roman%20Army%29">decimation</a> within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their <a href="dux">commander</a>, or whether he had his "entire" army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 <a href="legionaries">legionaries</a> would have been executed).

Plutarch only mentions the decimation of 50 legionaries of one cohort as punishment after Mummius' defeat in the first confrontation between Crassus and Spartacus. Regardless of what actually occurred, Crassus' treatment of his legions proved that "he was more dangerous to them than the enemy", and spurred them on to victory rather than running the risk of displeasing their commander.

When the forces of Spartacus moved northwards once again, Crassus deployed six of his legions on the borders of the region (Plutarch claims the initial battle between Crassus' legions and Spartacus' followers occurred near the <a href="Picenum">Picenum</a> region, Appian claims it occurred near the region of <a href="Samnium">Samnium</a>), and detached two legions under his <a href="legatus">legate</a>, Mummius, to maneuver behind Spartacus, but gave them orders not to engage the rebels. When an opportunity presented itself, Mummius disobeyed, attacked the Spartacan forces, and was subsequently routed. Despite this initial loss, Crassus engaged Spartacus and defeated him, killing some 6,000 of the rebels.

The tide seemed to have turned in the war. Crassus' legions were victorious in several engagements, killing thousands of the rebel slaves, and forcing Spartacus to retreat south through <a href="Lucania">Lucania</a> to the straits near <a href="Messina">Messina</a>. According to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Spartacus made a bargain with <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>n pirates to transport him and some 2,000 of his men to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where he intended to incite a slave revolt and gather reinforcements. However, he was betrayed by the pirates, who took payment and then abandoned the rebel slaves. Minor sources mention that there were some attempts at raft and shipbuilding by the rebels as a means to escape, but that Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure the rebels could not cross to Sicily, and their efforts were abandoned.

Spartacus' forces then retreated towards <a href="Rhegium">Rhegium</a>. Crassus' legions followed and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The rebels were under siege and cut off from their supplies.

At this time, the legions of <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> were returning to Italy, having put down the rebellion of <a href="Quintus%20Sertorius">Quintus Sertorius</a> in <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>.

Sources disagree on whether Crassus had requested reinforcements, or whether the Senate simply took advantage of Pompey's return to Italy, but Pompey was ordered to bypass Rome and head south to aid Crassus. The Senate also sent reinforcements under the command of "Lucullus", mistakenly thought by <a href="Appian">Appian</a> to be <a href="Lucullus">Lucius Licinius Lucullus</a>, commander of the forces engaged in the <a href="Third%20Mithridatic%20War">Third Mithridatic War</a> at the time, but who appears to have been the <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Terentius%20Varro%20Lucullus">Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus</a>, the former's younger brother. With Pompey's legions marching out of the north, and Lucullus' troops landing in <a href="Brundisium">Brundisium</a>, Crassus realized that if he did not put down the slave revolt quickly, credit for the war would go to the general who arrived with reinforcements, and thus he spurred his legions on to end the conflict quickly.

Hearing of the approach of Pompey, Spartacus attempted to negotiate with Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived. When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces broke out of confinement and fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern <a href="Strongoli">Strongoli</a>) in <a href="Bruttium">Bruttium</a>, with Crassus' legions in pursuit. The legions managed to catch a portion of the rebels – under the command of Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.

Crassus' legions also suffered losses. The Roman forces under the command of a cavalry officer named Lucius Quinctius were routed when some of the escaped slaves turned to meet them. The rebel slaves were not a professional army, and had reached their limit. They were unwilling to flee any farther, and groups of men were breaking away from the main force to independently attack the oncoming legions of Crassus.

With discipline breaking down, Spartacus turned his forces around and brought his entire strength to bear on the oncoming legions. In this last stand, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Silarius%20River">Battle of the Silarius River</a>, Spartacus' forces were finally routed completely, with the vast majority of them being killed on the battlefield. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield. However, his body was never found.

The rebellion of the Third Servile War was annihilated by Crassus. Although Pompey's forces did not directly engage Spartacus's forces at any time, his legions moving in from the north were able to capture some 5,000 rebels fleeing the battle, "all of whom he slew". After this action, Pompey sent a dispatch to the Senate, saying that while Crassus certainly had conquered the slaves in open battle, he himself had ended the war, thus claiming a large portion of the credit and earning the enmity of Crassus.

While most of the rebel slaves were killed on the battlefield, some 6,000 survivors were captured by the legions of Crassus. All 6,000 were <a href="Crucifixion">crucified</a> along the <a href="Appian%20Way">Appian Way</a> from <a href="Rome">Rome</a> to <a href="Capua">Capua</a>.

Pompey and Crassus reaped political benefit for having put down the rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a>ship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as <a href="praetor">praetor</a> or <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>. Nonetheless, both men were elected <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a> for 70 BC, partly due to the implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.

The effects of the Third Servile War on Roman attitudes towards slavery, and on the institution of slavery in Rome, are harder to determine. Certainly the revolt had shaken the Roman people, who "out of sheer fear seem to have begun to treat their slaves less harshly than before." The wealthy owners of the <a href="latifundia">latifundia</a> began to reduce the number of agricultural slaves, opting to employ the large pool of formerly dispossessed freemen in <a href="sharecropping">sharecropping</a> arrangements. With the end of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>' reign (27 BC - 14 AD), the major Roman wars of conquest ceased until the reign of Emperor <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> (reigned 98–117 AD), and with them ended the supply of plentiful and inexpensive slaves through military conquest. This era of peace further promoted the use of freedmen as laborers in agricultural estates.

The legal status and rights of Roman slaves also began to change. During the time of Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> (reigned 41–54 AD), a constitution was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown that they were being mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be "direct" results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.

It is difficult to determine the extent to which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.

Irritator

Irritator is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Spinosauridae">spinosaurid</a> <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> during the <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="Geological%20stage">stage</a> of the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="Geological%20period">Period</a>, about 110 million years ago. It is known from a nearly complete <a href="skull">skull</a> found in the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a> of the <a href="Araripe%20Basin">Araripe Basin</a>. <a href="Fossil%20collecting">Fossil dealers</a> had acquired this skull and illegally sold it to the <a href="State%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20Stuttgart">State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart</a>. In <a href="1996%20in%20paleontology">1996</a>, the specimen became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> Irritator challengeri. The genus name comes from the word "irritation", reflecting the feelings of <a href="Paleontology">paleontologists</a> who found the skull had been heavily damaged and altered by the collectors. The <a href="species">species</a> name is an homage to the fictional character <a href="Professor%20Challenger">Professor Challenger</a> from <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s novels.

Many paleontologists regard Angaturama limai—known from a snout tip that was described later in 1996—as a potential <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> of "Irritator". Both animals hail from the same <a href="stratigraphic%20unit">stratigraphic unit</a>s of the Araripe Basin. It was also previously proposed that "Irritator" and "Angaturama"s skull parts belonged to the same specimen. Although this has been cast into doubt, more overlapping fossil material is needed to confirm whether they are the same animal or not. Other spinosaurid skeletal material, some of which could belong to "Irritator" or "Angaturama", was retrieved from the Romualdo Formation, allowing for a replica skeleton to be made and mounted for display at the <a href="National%20Museum%20%28Rio%20de%20Janeiro%29">National Museum of Rio de Janeiro</a> in 2009.

Estimated at between in length, "Irritator" weighed around , making it one of the smallest spinosaurids known. Its long, shallow and slender snout was lined with straight and unserrated conical teeth. Lengthwise atop the head ran a thin <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>, to which powerful neck muscles were likely anchored. The nostrils were positioned far back from the tip of the snout, and a rigid <a href="secondary%20palate">secondary palate</a> on the roof of the mouth would have strengthened the jaw when feeding. Belonging to a subadult, "Irritator challengeri"s holotype remains the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull yet found. The "Angaturama" snout tip expanded to the sides in a <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a>-like shape, bearing long teeth and an unusually tall crest. One possible skeleton indicates it, like other spinosaurids, had enlarged first-finger claws and a <a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">sail</a> running down its back.

"Irritator" had been mistaken initially for a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, and later a <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n dinosaur. In 1996, the animal was identified as a spinosaurid theropod. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> skull was thoroughly prepared before being redescribed in 2002, confirming this classification. Both "Irritator" and "Angaturama" belong to the <a href="Spinosauridae%23Phylogeny">Spinosaurinae</a> <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a>. A <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">generalist</a> diet—like that of today's <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns—has been suggested; "Irritator" might have preyed mainly on fish and any other small prey animals it could catch. Fossil evidence is known of an individual that ate a pterosaur, either from hunting or scavenging it. "Irritator" may have had <a href="semiaquatic">semiaquatic</a> habits, and inhabited the tropical environment of a coastal <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> surrounded by dry regions. It coexisted with other carnivorous theropods as well as turtles, <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliforms</a>, and a large number of pterosaur and fish species.

Commercial <a href="Fossil%20collecting">fossil-poachers</a> excavated a chalk <a href="concretion">concretion</a> containing the rear of a large skull with lower jaws near the town of <a href="Santana%20do%20Cariri">Santana do Cariri</a> in <a href="northeastern%20Brazil">northeastern Brazil</a>. This <a href="fossil">fossil</a> was acquired by dealers who illegally sold it—<a href="Fossil%20collecting">fossil trade</a> has been prohibited by law in Brazil since 1942—to Rupert Wild of the <a href="State%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20Stuttgart">State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart</a>, Germany. At the time it was assumed to be the skull of a giant <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, or flying reptile, since the <a href="Chapada%20do%20Araripe">Chapada do Araripe</a> region is famous for its copious pterosaur finds, and the German museum often bought such pieces. As it promised to be a unique discovery of singular importance, German and British pterosaur experts were contacted to study the exemplar. A paper describing it as a pterosaur had already been submitted for publication when the authors, British <a href="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> Eberhard Frey and his German colleague <a href="Hans-Dieter%20Sues">Hans-Dieter Sues</a>, were disabused of this notion by the peer reviewers, who suggested the fossil belonged to a <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> dinosaur.

The skull was flattened somewhat sideways and, as is common with fossils, was partly crushed. The right side was well-preserved, while the left was extensively damaged during collection. Some of the skull's hindmost upper surface had eroded, and the lower jaw lacked its front end, both owing to breakage during fossilization. Parts of the specimen were also cracked due to being part of a septarian <a href="concretion">concretion</a>. The tip of the upper jaw was also missing. Since there were no signs of erosion, it had most probably broken off during or after the fossil's collection. Evident corrosion on certain bones indicates acid preparation had been attempted. A vertical fracture was present across the middle of the skull, which had apparently been sealed with car body filler. In hopes of making it look more complete and valuable, the fossil traders had severely obscured the skull beneath plaster; a widespread practice among local collectors in the Chapada do Araripe, especially on fish fossils. The buyers were unaware of the modifications to the illegally collected specimen until it was sent to universities in the United Kingdom for <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a> imaging. This revealed the collectors had tried to reconstruct the skull by grafting parts of the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (main upper jaw bone) onto the front of the <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> (snout). The skull (designated SMNS 58022) became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen of the new <a href="genus">genus</a> and <a href="species">species</a> "Irritator challengeri" in February <a href="1996%20in%20paleontology">1996</a>, when it was first scientifically described by <a href="Paleontology">paleontologists</a> David M. Martill, Arthur R. I. Cruickshank, Eberhard Frey, Philip G. Small and Malcolm Clarke. In this paper, Martill and his team wrote that the <a href="Genus">generic name</a> "Irritator" came "from irritation, the feeling the authors felt (understated here) when discovering that the snout had been artificially elongated." The <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, "Irritator challengeri," was named after <a href="Professor%20Challenger">Professor Challenger</a>, a character in <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s novels, specifically "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%28Conan%20Doyle%20novel%29">The Lost World</a>". Two years earlier, Frey and Martill had named a new pterosaur species from the <a href="Crato%20Formation">Crato Formation</a> "<a href="Arthurdactylus">Arthurdactylus</a> conandoylei", after the novelist himself.

When Martill and colleagues first described "Irritator challengeri", the holotype was still extensively encased in <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> rock <a href="Matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a>. Researcher Diane M. Scott from the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> assumed the task of fully cleaning out the skull, allowing for a detailed redescription in 2002. Written by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, this inspection of the now fully prepared specimen negated many of Martill and colleagues' original observations, which were based on misinterpretations of the damaged and largely concealed skull. The estimated length of the complete skull was shorter than previously proposed. What was originally thought to be a prominent head crest proved to be an unattached, indeterminate bone fragment. Furthermore, additional skull bones were identified. As in the previous study, Sues and colleagues regarded the African genus "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>" as the most similar <a href="taxon">taxon</a> to "Irritator", because they shared many dental features, including mostly straight conical <a href="Crown%20%28tooth%29">tooth crowns</a>, thin <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, well-defined edges with no , and lengthwise fluting. Since little was known of "Spinosaurus"s skull at the time, these similarities were enough for the authors to suggest a possible <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonymy</a> of "Irritator" with "Spinosaurus". Sues and colleagues noted that more overlapping skull material was needed for further diagnosis. As more of "Spinosaurus"s skull became known, later research maintained separation of the two taxa.

Although the site of discovery is uncertain, the specimen most probably stems from the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a> (previously designated the Romualdo Member of the then <a href="Santana%20Formation">Santana Formation</a>). This assignment was confirmed by <a href="microfossils">microfossils</a> of the <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a> "Pattersoncypris", and fish scales from the <a href="Ichthyodectidae">ichthyodectid</a> "<a href="Cladocyclus">Cladocyclus</a>", both found in the Romualdo Formation. Questioning of local fossil dealers hinted at a locality near the village of Buxexé close to Santana Do Cariri at the flank of the Chapada do Araripe, at a height of approximately . Since the Romualdo Formation is indeed exposed there, and the matrix encasing the holotype has the same color and texture as those rocks, this locality can be regarded as the probable site of discovery of the fossil. "Irritator challengeri" was the first dinosaur described from the Romualdo Formation, and its holotype specimen represents the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull known. 

"Angaturama limai", another <a href="Spinosauridae">spinosaurid</a> from the same time and place as "Irritator challengeri", was described by the Brazilian paleontologists <a href="Alexander%20Kellner">Alexander W. A. Kellner</a> and Diogenes A. Campos in February 1996. Kept today under specimen number USP GP/2T-5 at the <a href="University%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">University of São Paulo</a>, the holotype specimen consists of an isolated snout tip from the Romualdo Formation. It was extracted from a calcareous <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodule</a> using a technique originally developed for pterosaur fossils. The generic name is in reference to Angaturama, a protective spirit in the aboriginal <a href="Tupi%20people">Tupi Indian</a> culture of Brazil. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honors the late Brazilian paleontologist Murilo R. de Lima, who informed Kellner of the specimen in 1991.

In 1997, British paleontologists <a href="Alan%20J.%20Charig">Alan J. Charig</a> and <a href="Angela%20Milner">Angela C. Milner</a> considered "Angaturama" a likely junior synonym of "Irritator", noting that both genera had retracted nostrils, long jaws, and characteristic spinosaurid dentition. <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> and colleagues in 1998 agreed with this possibility, and additionally observed that the holotype of "Angaturama" seems to complete that of "Irritator" (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). Authors including <a href="%C3%89ric%20Buffetaut">Éric Buffetaut</a> and Mohamed Ouaja in 2002, <a href="Cristiano%20Dal%20Sasso">Cristiano Dal Sasso</a> and colleagues in 2005, Tor G. Bertin in 2010, <a href="Darren%20Naish">Darren Naish</a> in 2013, and Madani Benyoucef and colleagues in 2015 supported this conclusion. In their redescription of "Irritator", Sues and colleagues pointed out that both holotypes are equally as narrow, and share transversely round teeth with defined yet unserrated edges. They also noted that a sagittal crest on "Angaturama"s premaxillae may correspond with that of "Irritator"s nasal bones. Some objection has been raised to these assertions. Kellner and Campos in 2000 and Brazilian paleontologist Elaine B. Machado and Kellner in 2005 expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the holotype of "Angaturama limai" was clearly more laterally flattened than that of "Irritator challengeri".

A review of both fossils by the Brazilian paleontologists Marcos A. F. Sales and Cesar L. Schultz in 2017 noted that the specimens also differ in other aspects of their preservation: the "Irritator" specimen is brighter in color and is affected by a vertical crack, while the "Angaturama" specimen bears many cavities; the damage to the teeth of the "Irritator challengeri" holotype is also much less severe. Sales and Schultz also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of "Angaturama" could have been larger than that of "Irritator" based on the proportions of the closely related genus "<a href="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a>". They therefore concluded that the two specimens do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If "Angaturama" and "Irritator" are regarded as a member of the same genus, the latter would be the valid scientific name under rules of <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a>, since it was named almost a month earlier.

Besides the skull elements and some isolated teeth, the Romualdo Formation has also yielded l remains from spinosaurids, many of which are hitherto undescribed, and all of them pertaining to the <a href="Spinosaurinae">Spinosaurinae</a> <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a>. In 2004, parts of a <a href="Vertebral%20column">spinal column</a> (MN 4743-V) were unearthed at the formation. Brazilian paleontologist Jonathas Bittencourt and Kellner assigned these, due to their structure, to the Spinosauridae. It is uncertain whether this specimen can be referred to "Irritator" or "Angaturama", given that both are based only on skull material. In 2007, Machado and Kellner tentatively referred a rib fragment (MN 7021-V) to the Spinosauridae. However, the most complete spinosaur specimen retrieved from the Romualdo Formation is MN 4819-V, a partial skeleton lacking the skull. First reported in 1991, the specimen was referred by Kellner to the Spinosauridae in 2001 because of its tall <a href="Sacrum">sacral</a> <a href="Vertebra">neural spines</a> and the enlarged condition of the hand <a href="ungual">claw</a>. The skeleton was fully described in 2010 in an as-of-yet unpublished master's thesis by Machado. An incomplete hind limb (MPSC R-2089) mentioned in 2013 might also pertain to the Spinosauridae. In <a href="2018%20in%20archosaur%20paleontology">2018</a>, Tito Aureliano and his team described LPP-PV-0042, part of a left tibia from a particularly large individual. As is common with fossils from the <a href="Araripe%20Basin">Araripe Basin</a>, the majority of spinosaurid material from the Romualdo Formation was collected under uncontrolled circumstances for use in the illegal fossil trade. As such, many specimens are partly damaged and without precise geological field data.

Some of the Romualdo Formation postcrania were used as the basis for the creation of a replica "Angaturama" skeleton, later mounted at the Federal University-owned Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (<a href="National%20Museum%20%28Rio%20de%20Janeiro%29">National Museum of Rio de Janeiro</a>). The skeleton depicted the animal carrying an <a href="Anhangueridae">anhanguerid</a> pterosaur in its jaws. It was the centerpiece of the "Dinossauros no <a href="Sert%C3%A3o">Sertão</a>" (Dinosaurs of Sertão) exhibit, which opened to the public in March 2009, becoming the first large carnivorous Brazilian dinosaur to be put on display. Some of the original postcranial elements (including the fossil pelvis and sacral vertebrae) were presented alongside the mount. In press releases of the exhibit's opening, Kellner informally implied MN 4819-V as belonging to "Angaturama". This is also reflected in the specimen's inclusion in the skeletal mount. In <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>, a third Brazilian spinosaur, "<a href="Oxalaia">Oxalaia</a> quilombensi", was named and described from the <a href="Alc%C3%A2ntara%20Formation">Alcântara Formation</a> of the Itapecuru Group, part of the São Luís Basin. This larger species, known only from an isolated snout tip and upper jaw fragment, lived during the <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> stage, around six to nine million years after "Irritat"or and "Angaturama". "Oxalaia quilombensis" is differentiated from "Angaturama limai" by its broader, more rounded snout and lack of a sagittal crest on the premaxillae. In September 2018, <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Brazil%232018%20fire">a fire</a> broke out at the palace housing the Museu Nacional, largely destroying the fossil collections and possibly the exhibited "Angaturama" skeleton and fossil elements. The holotype of "Oxalaia quilombensis", which was stored in the same building, may also have been destroyed.

Even by maximal size estimates, "Irritator" was smaller than other known spinosaurids. <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> calculated its length at and weight at . <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%20Jr.">Thomas R. Holtz Jr.</a> published a higher estimate of , with a weight between . Estimates by <a href="Dougal%20Dixon">Dougal Dixon</a> were lower at long and high. When scaled by Aureliano and colleagues, the reconstructions from the study by Sales and Schultz provided a length of for the "Irritator challengeri" holotype, and for the "Angaturama limai" holotype. Some of the skull bones of the former holotype had not yet fully <a href="Co-ossification">co-ossified</a> (fused), indicating that the specimen belonged to a subadult. The partial spinosaurine skeleton MN 4819-V represented a moderately-sized individual, estimated by Machado at in length. Many elements from this specimen were incorporated into the skeletal mount in the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, which had a length of and a height of . However, spinosaurids from the Romualdo Formation possibly attained greater sizes. Although LPP-PV-0042 is represented only by a tibia fragment, Aureliano and colleagues estimated its length at roughly . Bone <a href="histology">histology</a> indicates that this individual was a subadult, so the mature animal may have been larger.

The holotype skull of "Irritator challengeri", although heavily damaged in certain places, is largely complete; missing only the tip of the snout and the front of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a>. The preserved skull is tall and wide, its full length has been estimated at roughly , based on comparisons with "Baryonyx". "Irritator"s skull was long, narrow, and somewhat triangular in cross section. The was inclined backwards, and deeper than it was long. Extending from it was an elongate and low snout, with both sides relatively flat and slightly angled towards the skull midline. Only the rear ends of the paired (frontmost snout bones) remain intact, forming the front upper and lower borders of the (bony nostrils). As in all spinosaurids, the (main upper jaw bones) extended below and past the nostrils in a long, low branch that formed the lower border of this opening, consequently separating the premaxillae and bones in that location. "Irritator"s <a href="maxillary%20sinus">maxillary sinus</a>es (located in the body of the maxillae) bore a large oval opening, as in "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". The nostril openings were oval and, as in all spinosaurids, positioned farther back on the skull than in typical theropods. "Irritator"s nostrils were both proportionately and absolutely smaller than in "<a href="Suchomimus">Suchomimus</a>" and "Baryonyx", but larger than those of "Spinosaurus". The opening behind the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye socket), the <a href="lateral%20temporal%20fenestra">lateral temporal fenestra</a>, was very large, while the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>, in front of the eyes, was long and elliptical. The orbit itself was deep and wider at the top (where the eyeball was placed) than the bottom. The bone separated the orbit from the antorbital fenestra, forming the upper and lower rear margins of the latter with two <a href="Process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> that enclosed a 40-degree angle; similar to "Baryonyx", where it enclosed 35 degrees. Unlike in "Baryonyx", "Irritator"s lacrimal did not form a bony horn core. The <a href="prefrontal%20bones">prefrontal</a> bones were large and sturdy, while the thinner bones, situated behind them, were smooth and concave on top; both of these bones formed the upper rim of the orbit.

A thin <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>, constructed from the elongate nasal bones, ran up the skull midline before stopping just above the eye in a slightly flattened bulge. Although the complete shape and height of this structure is unknown in "Irritator", these head crests were commonplace in spinosaurids, having possibly served a <a href="Sexual%20display">display</a> function when the animal was alive. The preserved part of "Irritator"s crest is deepest above the antorbital fenestra and lacks the vertical ridges seen in the crest of "Spinosaurus". Like others in its <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, "Irritator" possessed a long and bony structure on the roof of its mouth called a <a href="secondary%20palate">secondary palate</a>, separating the oral from the nasal cavity. This is a feature observed in extant <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns, but absent in most theropod dinosaurs. Also like its relatives, "Irritator" had two additional openings on the skull roof (called the postnasal fenestrae) as well as long and only partially diverging (bony extensions connecting the braincase with the <a href="palate">palate</a>). The back of the lower jaw was deep, its rear upper surface consisting mainly of the large bone, which with the shallower bone below it. The , a sideways-facing opening in the lower jaw, was oval and comparatively large. The (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) is unknown in "Irritator", save for a possible remnant at the front of the surangular. "Irritator challengeri"s holotype is unique in that it is one of the few non-<a href="Aves">avian</a> (or non-bird) dinosaur fossils found with a preserved <a href="stapes">stapes</a>.

"Irritator" had straight or only faintly recurved conical teeth, bearing sharply defined but unserrated edges. Flutes (lengthwise ridges) were present on its tooth crowns, a common dental trait among spinosaurids. Both sides of "Irritator"s teeth were fluted, as in "Spinosaurus", whereas "Baryonyx" exhibited them only on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20dentistry%23Lingual">lingual</a> (inward facing) side of its teeth. "Irritator"s teeth were circular in cross section, as opposed to the laterally flattened condition of most theropod teeth. The enamel (first layer of the teeth) was thin, with a finely wrinkled texture also observed in "Baryonyx." Both of "Irritator"s maxillae preserve nine teeth, although the left maxilla's tooth crowns are more intact, and there are traces of a tenth tooth in the rock matrix. The teeth were deeply inserted into the jaw and widely spaced towards the front of the maxilla. The first and second preserved maxillary teeth were the largest, at and in crown length. The seven remaining teeth became progressively smaller towards the rear, one of the last ones measuring in estimated crown length. CT scans performed on the specimen revealed <a href="replacement%20teeth">replacement teeth</a> on both sides of the upper jaw. Their <a href="Tooth%20root">roots</a> ran deep into the maxillae and converged close to the midline, nearly reaching the top of the skull. Based on comparisons with "Irritator"s relatives, the maxillae were probably lined with a total of 11 teeth each, similar to the number of 12 teeth in MSNM V4047, an upper jaw fossil referred to "Spinosaurus". The hindmost tooth of the "Irritator" specimen's left maxilla was not yet fully erupted, and only the tip of it was visible.

The holotype of "Angaturama" "limai" consists only of the front part of the upper jaw, comprising the tips of the paired premaxillae and the frontmost ends of the maxillae. The specimen measures in height and in length, with the width of the palatal region being . The <a href="Suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> between the maxilla and premaxilla was jagged at the front and straightened out towards the rear. The lower margin of the premaxillae was concave, with the concavity reaching its apex at the sixth premaxillary tooth. The front of the snout was expanded, forming the spoon-shaped terminal <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a> characteristic of spinosaurids. This concave underside of the premaxillae would have complemented a convex and enlarged mandible tip. The premaxillae connected with each other on the bottom to form "Angaturama"s secondary palate, which was also partially contributed to by two processes extending from the maxillae. The snout was strongly compressed laterally, and the premaxillae gently tapered towards the top to form a tall sagittal crest in thickness. This crest was larger and extended farther forwards on the snout than in other known spinosaurids. The frontmost upper border of the premaxilla had a small bulge that overhung the base of the crest. This bulge was apparently damaged on its upper surface, indicating that the top of the crest may have extended even farther over and forwards from that point. The front of "Angaturama"s snout hence had a vertically straight or concave margin, atypical from the more smoothly-sloping snouts of other spinosaurs.

In the premaxilla, a broken-off tooth with partial tooth crown was recovered. The strongly extended and straight teeth with unserrated conical crowns, which measured in length, were singly embedded. This indicates continuous tooth replacement where new teeth were pushed up between the old ones. Judging by the (tooth sockets), the premaxilla had seven teeth altogether, the third tooth being the largest. The frontmost three teeth of the maxilla were also preserved. The premaxillary teeth increased in size from the first to third, shrank from the third to the sixth, and enlarged again from the sixth premaxillary to third maxillary positions. A <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap in tooth row) was present between the last premaxillary and first maxillary tooth.

Though no skeletal remains were discovered with the original "Angaturama" snout tip, one partial skeleton (MN 4819-V) from a different location may belong to the genus. But since there is no overlapping material between the two specimens, direct comparisons cannot be made. MN 4819-V comprises a largely intact <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>, some <a href="Dorsal%20vertebra">dorsal</a> (back) and (tail) <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e, five (hip) vertebrae, a partial right and (shin and calf bones), most of the right (thigh bone), and part of an (forearm bone). It also has the most complete <a href="Manus%20%28anatomy%29">hand</a> known from a spinosaurid, including , , one , and one . Like in all spinosaurids, the claw of the first finger (the "thumb") was strongly recurved and enlarged.

The <a href="Pelvic%20bones">pelvic</a> bones are well-preserved, with the right side better articulated than the left. The fused sacral vertebrae are still attached to the pelvis, which lacks the distal ends of both of its and (lower and rearmost hip bones). The (main hip bone) is long. The (front expansion) of the ilium was curved on the bottom and was somewhat shorter and deeper than the (rear expansion). The preacetabular ala were somewhat enlarged at the front, in contrast to the more slender condition of the postacetabular ala. The (groove at the bottom of the postacetabular ala) was concave, as was the rear margin of the ischium. The pubis bore a relatively large and almost closed , an indentation in the lower margin of the rear part of the bone that allowed for the passage of the <a href="obturator%20nerve">obturator nerve</a>. The upwards projecting neural spines of the sacrum were elongated, as is typical in spinosaurs. In life, these would have been covered in skin, forming a "<a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">sail</a>" down the animal's back. MN 4819-V is distinguished from "Suchomimus" due to its longer and shallower ilium with a less curved upper margin, and from "Baryonyx" by having a more developed , a blade-like structure on the bottom of the ischium.

Martill and his team originally classified "Irritator" as a <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n dinosaur in the <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Bullatosauria">Bullatosauria</a> (a group no longer considered <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>), as a close relative to the feathered <a href="Ornithomimosauria">ornithomimosaurs</a> and <a href="Troodontidae">troodontids</a>. Given that its dental <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, particularly long snout, and assumed fin-shaped crest were features unknown in "other" maniraptorans, the researchers erected the new family Irritatoridae within the clade. They recognized "Irritator"s affinities with "Spinosaurus", in that they both had similarly shaped and unserrated teeth, but noted that the latter's mandible would not conform with the front of "Irritator"s upper jaw, and that other non-avian dinosaurs like "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>" and "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>" also bore no serrations on some or all of their teeth. Some of these claims were questioned in 1996 by Kellner who found that "Irritator"s skull lacked the one <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphy</a> (distinguishing feature) diagnosed in maniraptorans at the time, which was having its (cheek) bone forming part of the antorbital fenestra. He also pointed out that since "Irritator challengeri"s holotype lacked the tip of its snout, it would not be possible to know if "Spinosaurus"s dentary could complement it or not. Based on comparisons with "Spinosaurus", Kellner resolved "Irritator" as a spinosaurid and synonymized Irritatoridae with that family. "Irritator" was then assigned to the <a href="Baryonychidae">Baryonychidae</a> along with "Angaturama", "Baryonyx", "Suchomimus," and "Spinosaurus" by Oliver W. M. Rauhut in 2003. <a href="Thomas%20Holtz">Thomas Holtz</a> and colleagues in 2004 considered the Baryonychidae synonymous with Spinosauridae, and moved these genera to the latter family. Most later revisions have upheld these classifications. As spinosaurids, "Irritator" and "Angaturama" are placed within the <a href="Superfamily%20%28biology%29">superfamily</a> <a href="Megalosauroidea">Megalosauroidea</a>, with Spinosauridae being a possible <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the <a href="Megalosauridae">Megalosauridae</a>.

In 1998, Sereno and colleagues defined two subfamilies within the Spinosauridae based on craniodental (skull and tooth) characteristics. They were Spinosaurinae, where they placed "Spinosaurus" and "Irritator"; and Baryonychinae, to which they assigned "Baryonyx, Suchomimus," and "<a href="Cristatusaurus">Cristatusaurus</a>". Spinosaurines were distinguished by their unserrated, straighter, and more widely spaced teeth, as well as smaller first teeth of the premaxilla."" In 2005, Dal Sasso and colleagues assumed "Irritator"s nostrils as being located above the middle of the maxillary tooth row; more posteriorly than in baryonychines, but less so than in "Spinosaurus". Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that "Irritator"s nostrils were in fact positioned closer to the front of the jaw, as in "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus"; this more forward nostril placement was typically considered characteristic of baryonychines. Nevertheless, "Irritator" also bore unserrated teeth, a trait associated with spinosaurines. Sales and Schultz thus noted that the Araripe Basin spinosaurids "Irritator" and "Angaturama" might represent intermediate forms between the earlier baryonychines and later spinosaurines, and that further research may eventually render the former a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> (unnatural) group.

"Irritator" is further distinguished from "Baryonyx", "Suchomimus", and "Cristatusaurus" by having slightly over half as many teeth in the maxilla, and from "Spinosaurus" due to its comparatively larger and more forwardly positioned nostril openings, which, unlike in "Spinosaurus", are also formed by the premaxilla. The narrow sagittal crest, which ends in a knob-like process above the frontals, is another autapomorphy separating "Irritator" from other spinosaurids. Although "Angaturama limai"s snout is generally narrower than in other spinosaurids, this might be due to damage sustained by the fossil; the holotype appears partly crushed and broken on its lower margin, with some of the preserved teeth having been sectioned off along their length. Therefore, "Angaturama"s only valid autapomorphy is its sagittal crest, which extends farther forwards on the rostrum and is more exaggerated than in other known spinosaurid skulls.

Topology A: Benson and colleagues (2009)

Topology B: Sales and Schultz (2017)

In 1996, Martill and colleagues theorized that "Irritator challengeri," with its elongated snout and unserrated conical teeth, likely had at least a partly <a href="Piscivore">piscivorous</a> (fish-eating) diet. Although much of the holotype's morphology turned out to be greatly different than they thought, later studies supported these observations. Spinosaurids had very narrow and elongated jaws with relatively <a href="Homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity">homogeneous</a> pointed teeth, an arrangement found particularly in animals like the Indian <a href="gharial">gharial</a>—the most piscivorous extant crocodilian. The long conical teeth, which in spinosaurines did not possess serrated edges, were suitable for grabbing and holding prey. They differed from teeth of other theropods, which seemed geared towards tearing or cutting off seized body parts.

"Irritator" shared with crocodilians a stiff secondary palate and reduced antorbital fenestrae. In 2007, a <a href="Finite%20element%20method">finite-element analysis</a> study by British paleontologist Emily J. Rayfield and colleagues found that these attributes, present in other spinosaurids as well, made the skull more resistant to <a href="Torsion%20%28mechanics%29">torsion</a> from prey item loads when feeding. The authors pointed out that in contrast, most theropods lacked secondary palates and had large antorbital fenestrae, exchanging strength for lighter skull builds. The nostrils of "Irritator" were shifted far back from the snout tip; this, along with the secondary palate, which separated the animal's nasal passages from the inside of its mouth, made respiration possible even if most of the jaw was underwater or held prey. In particular, the sagittal crest of "Irritator" is an indication for pronounced neck musculature, which would have been necessary to close the jaws quickly against water resistance and withdraw the head rapidly. In 2015, German paleontologist Serjoscha W. Evers and colleagues found evidence for similar adaptations in the African spinosaur "<a href="Sigilmassasaurus">Sigilmassasaurus</a>." The neck vertebrae of this genus have a heavily furrowed undersurface. This is consistent with the attachment of powerful neck muscles for use in fishing or rapidly snatching small prey, a trait also observed in extant crocodilians and birds. Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that "Irritator" and baryonychines might have relied more on their sense of smell for hunting than "Spinosaurus" did, since they had larger, less retracted nostrils and more room in their skulls for the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a>. "Spinosaurus" itself probably made heavier use of senses like vision or the <a href="mechanoreceptor">mechanoreceptor</a>s on the tip of its snout, like those used by crocodilians to sense prey moving in the water.

Another trait spinosaurs shared with gharials was an enlarged snout tip that wielded a rosette-shaped array of interlocking teeth, adept for impaling and catching fish. Although to a lesser degree than most known spinosaurs, this feature was also present in the "Angaturama limai" holotype. In 2002, Sues and colleagues pointed out, however, that there would be no reason to assume that the Spinosauridae specialized completely in fishing. They stressed rather that this head morphology indicates a <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">generalistic</a> feeding, particularly on small prey animals. In fact, portions of a young "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>", a terrestrial herbivore, were found inside the fossil skeleton of one "Baryonyx". Naish and colleagues in 2004 supported the theory that "Irritator" hunted both aquatic and terrestrial animals as a generalist within the coastal area and in addition probably searched for <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. A tooth belonging to "Irritator" was discovered still inserted into the fossil neck vertebral column of an <a href="Ornithocheiridae">ornithocheirid</a> pterosaur, likely with a wingspan of . This indicates that "Irritator" ate pterosaurs as well, although it is not known if it actively hunted these animals or simply scavenged the remains. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues presented a possible scenario for the <a href="food%20web">food web</a> of the Romualdo Formation. The researchers proposed that spinosaurines from the formation may have also preyed on terrestrial and aquatic <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliforms</a>, juveniles of their own species, turtles, and small to medium-sized dinosaurs. This would have made spinosaurines <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s within this particular ecosystem.

Many spinosaurs likely had <a href="semiaquatic">semiaquatic</a> habits, as has been shown in studies using techniques like <a href="isotope%20analysis">isotope analysis</a> and bone <a href="histology">histology</a>. It has been found that they probably took advantage of aquatic prey and environments (usually marginal and coastal habitats) to occupy a distinct <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>, therefore avoiding <a href="Competition%20%28biology%29">competition</a> with more terrestrial theropods. Spinosaurines appear to have been more adapted for such lifestyles than baryonychines. A 2018 study by British paleontologist Thomas M. S. Arden and colleagues examined the morphology of spinosaurine skull bones for possible aquatic traits. They found that the frontal bones of "Irritator", "Spinosaurus", and "Sigilmassasaurus" were similar in being arched, concave on top, and narrowed at the front; features that would have resulted in the eyes being positioned further up on the head than in other theropods. In particular, the broad lower jaw and narrowed frontals of "Irritator" resulted in the orbits facing at a steep incline towards the midline of the skull, whereas most theropods had laterally facing orbits. These traits would have permitted the animal to see above the waterline when submerged.

In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues conducted an analysis on the Romualdo Formation tibia fragment. CT scanning of the specimen in the <a href="University%20of%20San%20Carlos">University of San Carlos</a> revealed the presence of <a href="osteosclerosis">osteosclerosis</a> (high bone density). This condition had previously only been observed in "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus," as a possible way of facilitating submersion in water by making its bones heavier. The presence of this condition on the Brazilian leg fragment showed that compact bones had already evolved in spinosaurines at least 10 million years before the appearance of "Spinosaurus" in Morocco. According to <a href="phylogenetic%20bracketing">phylogenetic bracketing</a>—a method used to infer unknown traits in organisms by comparison with their relatives—osteosclerosis therefore might have been the norm in the Spinosaurinae. The significance of these traits was questioned in a later 2018 publication, where Canadian <a href="Paleobiology">paleobiologist</a> Donald Henderson argued that osteosclerosis would not have changed a theropod's buoyancy to a significant extent.

"Irritator" and "Angaturama" are known from the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a>, whose rocks are dated to the <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stage</a> of the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="Geological%20period">Period</a>, about 110 million years ago. During this time, the Southern <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> was opening, forming the series of circum-Atlantic <a href="Structural%20basin">basins</a> of southern Brazil and southwestern Africa, but the northeastern part of Brazil and West Africa were still connected. The Romualdo Formation is part of the <a href="Santana%20Group">Santana Group</a> and, at the time "Irritator" was described, was thought to be a <a href="Stratigraphic%20unit">member</a> of what was then considered the Santana Formation. The Romualdo Formation is a <a href="Lagerst%C3%A4tte">Lagerstätte</a> (a <a href="Sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> deposit that preserves fossils in excellent condition) consisting of limestone concretions embedded in <a href="shale">shale</a>s, and overlies the Crato Formation. It is well known for preserving fossils three-dimensionally in limestone concretions, including many pterosaur fossils. In addition to muscle fibres of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, fish preserving gills, digestive tracts, and hearts have been found there. The formation is interpreted as a coastal <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> with irregular freshwater influence that contended with cycles of <a href="Marine%20transgression">transgressing</a> and <a href="Marine%20regression">regressing</a> sea levels. The climate of the formation was tropical and largely corresponded to today's Brazilian climate. The regions surrounding the formation were arid to <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a>, with most of the local flora being <a href="Xerophyte">xerophytic</a> (adapted to dry environments). <a href="Cycadales">Cycadales</a> and the extinct <a href="Pinophyta">conifer</a> "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>" were the most widespread plants.

This environment was dominated by pterosaurs, including: <a href="Anhanguera%20%28pterosaur%29">"Anhanguera"</a>, "<a href="Araripedactylus">Araripedactylus</a>", "<a href="Araripesaurus">Araripesaurus</a>", "<a href="Brasileodactylus">Brasileodactylus</a>", "<a href="Cearadactylus">Cearadactylus</a>", "<a href="Coloborhynchus">Coloborhynchus</a>", "<a href="Santanadactylus">Santanadactylus</a>", <a href="Tapejara%20%28pterosaur%29">"Tapejara"</a>, "<a href="Thalassodromeus">Thalassodromeus</a>", "<a href="Tupuxuara">Tupuxuara</a>", "<a href="Barbosania">Barbosania</a>", "<a href="Maaradactylus">Maaradactylus</a>", "<a href="Tropeognathus">Tropeognathus</a>", and "<a href="Unwindia">Unwindia</a>." The known dinosaur fauna besides "Irritator" was represented by other theropods like the <a href="Tyrannosauroidea">tyrannosauroid</a> "<a href="Santanaraptor">Santanaraptor</a>," the <a href="Compsognathidae">compsognathid</a> "<a href="Mirischia">Mirischia</a>," an indeterminate <a href="Unenlagiinae">unenlagiine</a> <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a>, and a <a href="megaraptora">megaraptora</a>n. The crocodyliforms "<a href="Araripesuchus">Araripesuchus</a>" and "<a href="Caririsuchus">Caririsuchus</a>", as well as the turtles "<a href="Brasilemys">Brasilemys</a>", "<a href="Cearachelys">Cearachelys</a>," "<a href="Araripemys">Araripemys</a>", "<a href="Euraxemys">Euraxemys</a>", and "<a href="Santanachelys">Santanachelys</a>", are known from the deposits. There were also <a href="clam%20shrimp">clam shrimp</a>s, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, ostracods, and <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>. Various well-preserved fish fossils record the presence of: <a href="Hybodontidae">hybodont sharks</a>, <a href="guitarfish">guitarfish</a>, <a href="gar">gar</a>s, <a href="Amiidae">amiids</a>, <a href="ophiopsids">ophiopsids</a>, <a href="Oshuniidae">oshuniids</a>, <a href="Pycnodontidae">pycnodontids</a>, <a href="Aspidorhynchiformes">aspidorhynchids</a>, <a href="Ichthyodectidae">cladocyclids</a>, <a href="bonefishes">bonefishes</a>, <a href="Chanidae">chanids</a>, <a href="Mawsoniidae">mawsoniids</a> and some uncertain forms. According to Naish and colleagues, the lack of herbivorous dinosaurs could mean that the local vegetation was scant and thus incapable of sustaining a large population of them. The abundant carnivorous theropods would have then likely turned to the lush aquatic life as a primary food source. They also hypothesized that following storm events, pterosaur and fish carcasses might have washed up on the shoreline, providing theropods with plenty of carrion. Multiple piscivorous animals were present in the formation, which might in theory have led to high competition. Aureliano and colleagues stated there must have, therefore, been some degree of <a href="Niche%20differentiation">niche partitioning</a>, where different animals would have fed on prey of varied sizes and locations within the lagoon.

Similarities between the fauna of the Romualdo and Crato Formations to that of Middle Cretaceous Africa suggest that the Araripe Basin was connected to the <a href="Tethys%20Sea">Tethys Sea</a>, though this link was likely sporadic, because the lack of marine invertebrates indicates the basin had a non-marine depositional setting. Spinosaurids had already achieved a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a> during the Early Cretaceous. Sereno and colleagues in 1998 suggested that with the opening of the Tethys Sea, spinosaurines would have evolved in the south (Africa, in <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>) and baryonychines in the north (Europe, in <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>)."" In following, Machado and Kellner theorized in 2005 that spinosaurines would have then spread to South America from Africa. Sereno and colleagues postulated that <a href="divergent%20evolution">divergent evolution</a> between spinosaurines in South America and Africa likely occurred as a consequence of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, whose opening gradually separated the continents and contributed to differences between taxa."" A similar scenario was suggested in 2014 by Brazilian paleontologist Manuel A. Medeiros and colleagues for the fauna of the Alcântara Formation, where "Oxalaia" has been found. But the paleo<a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> of spinosaurids remains highly theoretical and uncertain, with discoveries in Asia and Australia indicating that it may have been complex.

The <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (changes between death and fossilization) of the "Irritator challengeri" holotype specimen has been discussed by some researchers. The skull was found lying on its side. Preceding fossilization, several bones from the back of the braincase, as well as the dentary, <a href="splenial">splenial</a>, <a href="Coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid</a>, and right angular bones from the lower jaw were lost. Other bones, mostly from the skull rear, had become and displaced towards alternate regions of the head before burial. Naish and colleagues in 2004 asserted that the Romualdo Formation dinosaur fauna is represented by animals that died near shorelines or rivers before being carried out to sea, where their floating remains were eventually fossilized. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues argued against this scenario, stating that the "Irritator challengeri" holotype's mandible was preserved in articulation with the rest of the skull, whereas it would have likely detached had the carcass been floating at sea. They also noted that the corpse would have quickly sunk due to the osteosclerosis of the skeleton. The researchers therefore concluded that fossils from the Santana Group represent organisms that were buried in their natural habitat, instead of having been deposited <a href="allochthon">allochthon</a>ously (other than at their present position).

Michelle Williams (actress)

Michelle Ingrid Williams (born September 9, 1980) is an American actress. She is particularly known for her work in small-scale <a href="independent%20film">independent</a> productions with dark or tragic themes. The recipient of <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">several accolades</a>, including a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>, Williams has been nominated for four <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> and one <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>.

Born to the politician and trader <a href="Larry%20R.%20Williams">Larry R. Williams</a>, she was raised in <a href="Kalispell%2C%20Montana">Kalispell, Montana</a>, and <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California. She began her career at a young age with television guest appearances and made her feature film debut in the family film "<a href="Lassie%20%281994%20film%29">Lassie</a>" (1994). At 15, she gained <a href="Emancipation%20of%20minors%23Emancipation%20in%20the%20United%20States">emancipation</a> from her parents, and soon achieved public recognition for her leading role in the television teen drama series "<a href="Dawson%27s%20Creek">Dawson's Creek</a>" (1998–2003). This was followed by low-profile films, before her breakthrough role in the romantic drama "<a href="Brokeback%20Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>" (2005), in which her performance as the wife of a gay man earned Williams her first Academy Award nomination.

Williams went on to gain critical acclaim for playing emotionally troubled women coping with loss or loneliness in the independent dramas "<a href="Wendy%20and%20Lucy">Wendy and Lucy</a>" (2008), "<a href="Blue%20Valentine%20%28film%29">Blue Valentine</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Manchester%20by%20the%20Sea%20%28film%29">Manchester by the Sea</a>" (2016). For portraying <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> in "<a href="My%20Week%20with%20Marilyn">My Week with Marilyn</a>" (2011), she won a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress</a>. Williams' highest-grossing releases came with the thriller "<a href="Shutter%20Island%20%28film%29">Shutter Island</a>" (2010), the fantasy film "<a href="Oz%20the%20Great%20and%20Powerful">Oz the Great and Powerful</a>" (2013), the musical "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Showman">The Greatest Showman</a>" (2017), and the superhero film "<a href="Venom%20%282018%20film%29">Venom</a>" (2018). On <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>, Williams has starred in revivals of the musical "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>" in 2014 and the drama "<a href="Blackbird%20%28play%29">Blackbird</a>" in 2016. For playing a sexually abused woman in "Blackbird", she received a nomination for the <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play</a>.

Despite significant media attention, Williams is reticent about her personal life. She was in a relationship with actor <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a> for three years, with whom she has a daughter, and she married musician <a href="Phil%20Elverum">Phil Elverum</a> in 2018.

Michelle Ingrid Williams was born on September 9, 1980, in <a href="Kalispell%2C%20Montana">Kalispell, Montana</a>, to Carla, a homemaker, and <a href="Larry%20R.%20Williams">Larry R. Williams</a>, an author and <a href="commodity">commodities</a> trader. She is of <a href="Norwegians">Norwegian</a> descent. Her father twice ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> nominee. In Kalispell, Williams lived with her three paternal half-siblings and her younger sister, Paige. Although she has described her family as "not terribly closely knit", she shared a close bond with her father, who taught her to fish and shoot, and encouraged her to become a keen reader. Williams has recounted fond memories of growing up in the vast landscape of Montana. When she was nine, the family moved to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California. She has said of the experience, "It was less happy probably by virtue of it being my preteen years, which are perhaps unpleasant wherever you go." She mostly kept to herself and was self-reliant.

Williams became interested in acting at an early age when she saw a local production of "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Tom%20Sawyer%20%28musical%29">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a>". She performed in an amateur production of the musical "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>", and her parents would drive her from San Diego to Los Angeles to audition for parts. Her first screen appearance was as Bridget Bowers, a young woman who seduces <a href="Mitch%20Buchannon">Mitch Buchannon</a>'s son, Hobie, in a 1993 episode of the television series "<a href="Baywatch">Baywatch</a>". The following year, she made her film debut in the family movie "<a href="Lassie%20%281994%20film%29">Lassie</a>", about the bond between a young boy (played by <a href="Tom%20Guiry">Tom Guiry</a>) and the <a href="Lassie">titular dog</a>. Williams played the love interest of Guiry's character, which led <a href="Steven%20Gaydos">Steven Gaydos</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" to take note of her "winning perf". She next took on guest roles in the television sitcoms "<a href="Step%20by%20Step%20%28TV%20series%29">Step by Step</a>" and "<a href="Home%20Improvement%20%28TV%20series%29">Home Improvement</a>", and appeared in the brief part of Sil, a character played in adulthood by the actress <a href="Natasha%20Henstridge">Natasha Henstridge</a>, in the 1995 science fiction film "<a href="Species%20%28film%29">Species</a>".

By 1995, Williams had completed ninth grade at <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Christian%20Schools">Santa Fe Christian Schools</a> in San Diego. She disliked going there as she did not get along well with other students. To focus on her acting pursuits, she left the school and enrolled for <a href="in-home%20tutoring">in-home tutoring</a>. At age 15, with her parents' approval, Williams filed for <a href="Emancipation%20of%20minors%23Emancipation%20in%20the%20United%20States">emancipation</a> from them, so she could better pursue her acting career with less interference from <a href="Child%20labor%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">child labor work laws</a>. To comply with the emancipation guidelines, she completed her high school education in nine months through correspondence. She later regretted not getting a proper education.

Following her emancipation, Williams relocated to Los Angeles and lived by herself in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>. Describing her initial experience in the city, she said, "There are some really disgusting people in the world, and I met some of them." To support herself, she took assignments in low-budget movies and commercials. She had minor roles in the television films "My Son is Innocent" (1996) and "<a href="Killing%20Mr.%20Griffin%20%28film%29">Killing Mr. Griffin</a>" (1997), and the drama "<a href="A%20Thousand%20Acres%20%28film%29">A Thousand Acres</a>" (1997), which starred <a href="Michelle%20Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> and <a href="Jessica%20Lange">Jessica Lange</a>. Williams later described her early work as "embarrassing", saying that she took these roles to support herself as she "didn't have any taste [or] ideals". In 1997, unhappy with the roles she was being offered, Williams collaborated with two other actresses to write a script named "Blink", about prostitutes living in a Nevada brothel, which despite being sold to a production company was never made. Having learned to trade under her father's guidance, the 17-year old Williams entered the Robbins World Cup Championship, a <a href="futures%20contract">futures trading</a> contest; with a return of 1000%, she became the first woman to win the title and the third-highest winner of all time (her father ranks first).

In 1998, Williams began starring in the television <a href="teen%20drama">teen drama</a> series "<a href="Dawson%27s%20Creek">Dawson's Creek</a>", created by <a href="Kevin%20Williamson%20%28screenwriter%29">Kevin Williamson</a> and co-starring <a href="James%20Van%20Der%20Beek">James Van Der Beek</a>, <a href="Katie%20Holmes">Katie Holmes</a>, and <a href="Joshua%20Jackson">Joshua Jackson</a>. The series aired for six seasons from January 1998 to May 2003 and featured Williams as Jen Lindley, a precocious and promiscuous New York-based teenager who relocates to the fictional town of Capeside. The series was filmed in the small town of <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, where Williams relocated for the next six years. In a review of the first season for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Caryn%20James">Caryn James</a> called it a <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> that was "redeemed by intelligence and sharp writing" but thought that Williams was "too earnest to suit this otherwise shrewdly tongue-in-cheek cast". <a href="Ray%20Richmond">Ray Richmond</a> of "Variety" labeled it "an addictive drama with considerable heart" and considered all four leads appealing. The series was a ratings success and raised Williams' profile. Her first film release since the start of "Dawson's Creek" was "" (1998), a <a href="slasher%20film">slasher film</a> starring <a href="Jamie%20Lee%20Curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>. The seventh installment in the <a href="Halloween%20%28franchise%29">"Halloween" film series</a>, it featured Williams as one of several teenagers traumatized by a murderer. It earned $55 million domestically against its $17 million budget.

Williams has credited "Dawson's Creek" as "the best acting class", but also admitted that she had not fully invested herself in it as "my taste was in contradiction to what I was doing every single day". She filmed the series for nine months each year and spent the remaining time playing against <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">type</a> in independent features, which she considered a better fit for her personality. She has said that the financial stability of a steady job empowered her to act in such films. Williams found her first such role in the comedy "<a href="Dick%20%28film%29">Dick</a>" (1999), a parody of the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>, in which she and <a href="Kirsten%20Dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a> played teenagers obsessed with <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. Praising the film's political satire, <a href="Lisa%20Schwarzbaum">Lisa Schwarzbaum</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" credited both actresses for playing their roles with "screwball verve". "Dick" failed to recoup its $13million investment. In the same year Williams played a small part in "<a href="But%20I%27m%20a%20Cheerleader">But I'm a Cheerleader</a>", a satirical comedy about <a href="conversion%20therapy">conversion therapy</a>.

Keen to play challenging roles in adult-oriented projects, Williams spent the summer of 1999 starring in an <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> play named "Killer Joe". Penned by <a href="Tracy%20Letts">Tracy Letts</a>, it is a <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> about a dysfunctional family who kills their matriarch for insurance money; Williams was cast as the family's youngest daughter. The production featured gruesome violence and required Williams to perform a nude scene. Her socially conservative parents were displeased with it, but Williams said that she found it "cathartic and freeing". Her next role was in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> television film "<a href="If%20These%20Walls%20Could%20Talk%202">If These Walls Could Talk 2</a>" (2000), a drama about three lesbian couples in different time periods. Williams agreed to the part after ensuring that a sex scene between <a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny">Chloë Sevigny</a> and her was pertinent to the story and was not meant to titillate. In a mixed review of the film, <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> criticized Williams for overplaying her character's eagerness. When asked about playing a series of sexual roles, Williams said, "I don't think of any of them as sexy, hot girls. They were just defined at an early age by the fact that others saw them that way." She subsequently made an effort to play roles that were not sexualized.

The British film "<a href="Me%20Without%20You%20%28film%29">Me Without You</a>" (2001), about an obsessive female friendship, starred Williams and <a href="Anna%20Friel">Anna Friel</a>. Williams played Holly, an insecure bibliophile, a part that came close to her personality. The writer-director <a href="Sandra%20Goldbacher">Sandra Goldbacher</a> was initially reluctant to cast an American in a British part but was impressed by Williams' self-deprecating humor and a "European stillness" that she found in her. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised Williams' British accent and found her to be "cuddly and smart both at once". Williams returned to stage the following year in a production of <a href="Mike%20Leigh">Mike Leigh</a>'s farce "Smelling a Rat". Her part, that of a scatterbrained teenager exploring her sexuality, led Karl Levett of "<a href="Backstage%20%28magazine%29">Backstage</a>" to credit her for being "a first-class creative comedienne". Williams played a supporting role in the <a href="Christina%20Ricci">Christina Ricci</a>-starring "<a href="Prozac%20Nation%20%28film%29">Prozac Nation</a>", a drama about depression based on <a href="Prozac%20Nation">Elizabeth Wurtzel's memoir</a>.

"Dawson's Creek" completed its run in 2003, and Williams was satisfied with how it had run its course. She relocated to New York City soon after. She had supporting parts in two art-house films that yearthe drama "<a href="The%20United%20States%20of%20Leland">The United States of Leland</a>" and the comedy-drama "<a href="The%20Station%20Agent">The Station Agent</a>". In the former, starring <a href="Ryan%20Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a>, she played the grieving sister of a murdered boy; it was described by "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>"s Liam Lacey as "neither an insightful nor well-made film". "The Station Agent", about a lonely dwarf (played by <a href="Peter%20Dinklage">Peter Dinklage</a>), featured Williams as a librarian who develops an attraction towards him. Critically acclaimed, the film's cast was nominated for the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast</a>. On stage, Williams played Varya in a 2004 production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>'s drama "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>", alongside <a href="Linda%20Emond">Linda Emond</a> and <a href="Jessica%20Chastain">Jessica Chastain</a>, at the <a href="Williamstown%20Theatre%20Festival">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a>. The theatre critic <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> wrote that "she cannily plays her natural vibrancy against the anxiety that has worn the young Varya into a permanent high-strung sullenness".

The German filmmaker <a href="Wim%20Wenders">Wim Wenders</a> wrote the film "<a href="Land%20of%20Plenty">Land of Plenty</a>" (2004), which investigates anxiety and disillusionment in a post-<a href="September%2011%20attacks">9/11</a> America, with Williams in mind. <a href="Kevin%20Thomas%20%28film%20critic%29">Kevin Thomas</a> of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" praised Wenders' thoughtful examination of the subject and took note of Williams' screen appeal. She received a nomination for the <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Lead">Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead</a> for the film. The actress next appeared in "<a href="Imaginary%20Heroes">Imaginary Heroes</a>", a drama about a family coping with their son's suicide, and played an impressionable young woman fixated on mental health in the period film "<a href="A%20Hole%20in%20One">A Hole in One</a>". Williams returned to the comedic genre with "<a href="The%20Baxter">The Baxter</a>", in which she played a geeky secretary. The film received negative reviews; <a href="Wesley%20Morris">Wesley Morris</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote, "Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny. Even in her slapstick, there's pain." As with her other films during this period, it only received a limited release and was not widely seen.

Williams gained wider recognition later in 2005 when she appeared in <a href="Ang%20Lee">Ang Lee</a>'s "<a href="Brokeback%20Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>", about the romance between two men, <a href="Ennis%20Del%20Mar">Ennis</a> and <a href="Jack%20Twist">Jack</a> (played by <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, respectively). Impressed with her performance in "The Station Agent", the casting director <a href="Avy%20Kaufman">Avy Kaufman</a> recommended Williams to Lee. He found a vulnerability in her and cast her as Alma, the wife of Ennis, who discovers her husband's homosexuality and infidelity. Williams was emotionally affected by the story, and in spite of her limited screen time, was drawn to playing a woman constricted by the social mores of the time. Labeling Williams as the standout among the cast, Ed Gonzalez of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" credited her for "fascinatingly spiking her unspoken resentment for her sham of a marriage with a hint of compassion for Ennis's secret suffering". "Brokeback Mountain" proved to be her most widely seen film to that point, earning $178 million against its $14 million budget. It won three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> and she gained a <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> nomination. Williams began dating Ledger while working on the film. The couple cohabited in <a href="Boerum%20Hill%2C%20Brooklyn">Boerum Hill, Brooklyn</a>, New York, and in 2005, she gave birth to their daughter.

Williams had two film releases in 2006. She first featured opposite <a href="Paul%20Giamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> in the drama "<a href="The%20Hawk%20Is%20Dying">The Hawk Is Dying</a>". Five months after giving birth to her daughter, she returned to work on <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>'s directorial venture "<a href="The%20Hottest%20State">The Hottest State</a>", based on his own novel. Leslie Felperin of "Variety" found her role to be too brief. Following the awards season success of "Brokeback Mountain", Williams was unsure of what to do next. After six months of indecision, she agreed to a small part in <a href="Todd%20Haynes">Todd Haynes</a>' "<a href="I%27m%20Not%20There">I'm Not There</a>" (2007), a musical inspired by the life of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. She was then attracted to the part of an enigmatic seductress named S in the 2008 crime thriller "<a href="Deception%20%282008%20film%29">Deception</a>". The film, which co-starred <a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a> and <a href="Ewan%20McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a>, was considered by critics to be middling and predictable. In her next release, "<a href="Incendiary%20%28film%29">Incendiary</a>", based on <a href="Chris%20Cleave">Chris Cleave</a>'s <a href="Incendiary%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>, Williams reteamed with McGregor to play a woman whose family is killed in a terrorist attack. In his review for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Robert Hanks called it "sloppy", and said that Williams deserved better.
Williams' two other releases of 2008 were better received. The screenwriter <a href="Charlie%20Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a> was impressed with her comic timing in "Dick" and thus cast her in his directorial debut "<a href="Synecdoche%2C%20New%20York">Synecdoche, New York</a>", an ensemble experimental drama headlined by <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>. It was a <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office bomb</a> and polarized critics, although Roger Ebert named it the best film of the decade. Two days after finishing work on "Synecdoche, New York", Williams began filming <a href="Kelly%20Reichardt">Kelly Reichardt</a>'s "<a href="Wendy%20and%20Lucy">Wendy and Lucy</a>", playing the part of a poor and lonesome young woman traveling with her dog and looking for employment. With a shoestring budget of $300,000, the film was shot on location in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, with a largely volunteer crew. Williams had just separated from Ledger and was relieved for the anonymity the project provided. She was pleased with Reichardt's minimalistic approach and identified with her character's self-sufficiency and fortitude. Sam Adams of "Los Angeles Times" found Williams' performance to be "remarkable not only for its depth but for its stillness" and <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> commended her for effectively conveying a "lived-in sense of always having been close to the economic brink".

While filming in Sweden for her next project, "<a href="Mammoth%20%282009%20film%29">Mammoth</a>" (2009), news broke that Ledger had died from an accidental <a href="Combined%20drug%20intoxication">intoxication from prescription drugs</a>. Although Williams continued filming, she later said, "It was horrible. I don't remember most of it." In her first public statement, a week after Ledger's death, Williams expressed her heartbreak and described Ledger's spirit as surviving in their daughter. Later that month she attended his memorial and funeral services.

"Mammoth" was directed by the Swedish director <a href="Lukas%20Moodysson">Lukas Moodysson</a> and featured Williams and <a href="Gael%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Bernal">Gael García Bernal</a> as a couple dealing with issues stemming from <a href="globalization">globalization</a>. Her role was that of an established surgeon, a part she deemed herself too young to logically play. In the same year she co-starred with <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a> in a <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>-directed faux perfume commercial called "Greed". For her next project, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> cast her opposite <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in the psychological thriller "<a href="Shutter%20Island%20%28film%29">Shutter Island</a>". Based on <a href="Dennis%20Lehane">Dennis Lehane</a>'s <a href="Shutter%20Island">novel</a>, it featured her as a depressed housewife who drowns her own children. The high-profile production marked a departure for her, and she found it difficult to adjust to the slower pace of filming. In preparation, she read case studies on infanticide. After finishing work on the film in 2008, Williams admitted that playing a series of troubled women coupled with her own personal difficulties had taken an emotional toll on her. She took a year off work to focus on her daughter. "Shutter Island" was released in 2010 and was a commercial success, grossing over $294million worldwide.

Williams first read the script of <a href="Derek%20Cianfrance">Derek Cianfrance</a>'s romantic drama "<a href="Blue%20Valentine%20%28film%29">Blue Valentine</a>" at age 21. When funding came through after years of delay, she was reluctant to accept the offer as filming in California would take her away from her daughter for too long. Keen to have her in the film, Cianfrance decided to film it near Brooklyn, where Williams lived. Co-starring Ryan Gosling, "Blue Valentine" is about the tribulations faced by a disillusioned married couple. Before production began, Cianfrance had Williams and Gosling live together for a month on a stipend that matched their character's income. This exercise led to conflicts between them, which proved conducive for filming their character's deteriorating marriage. On set, she and Gosling practiced <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> by improvising several scenes. The film premiered at the <a href="2010%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2010 Sundance Film Festival</a> to critical acclaim. <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> found Williams to be "heartbreakingly precise in every scene" and praised the couple for being "exemplars of New Method sincerity, able to be fully and achingly present every moment on screen together". Williams received Best Actress nominations at the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award</a> and the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%2C%20Drama">Golden Globe Award</a> ceremonies.

In her final film release of 2010, Williams reunited with Reichardt for the western "<a href="Meek%27s%20Cutoff%20%28film%29">Meek's Cutoff</a>". Set in 1854, it is based on an ill-fated historical incident on the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>, in which the frontier guide <a href="Stephen%20Meek">Stephen Meek</a> led a wagon train through a desert. Williams starred as one of the passengers on the wagon, a feisty young mother, who is suspicious of Meek. In preparation, she took lessons on firing a gun and learned to knit. Filming in extreme temperatures in the desert proved arduous for Williams, although she enjoyed the challenge. Writing for "<a href="The%20Arizona%20Republic">The Arizona Republic</a>", Bill Goodykoontz praised the subtlety in both the film and Williams' performance.

In 2011, Williams played the actress <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> in "<a href="My%20Week%20with%20Marilyn">My Week with Marilyn</a>", a drama depicting the troubled production of the 1957 comedy "<a href="The%20Prince%20and%20the%20Showgirl">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>", based on accounts by <a href="Colin%20Clark%20%28filmmaker%29">Colin Clark</a>, who worked on the latter film. Initially skeptical to play Monroe, as she had little in common with her looks or personality, Williams spent six months researching her by reading biographies, diaries and notes, and studying her posture, gait, and mannerisms. She also gained weight for the part, bleached her hair blond, and on days of filming, spent over three hours applying make-up. Williams sang three songs for the film's soundtrack and recreated a performance of Monroe singing and dancing to "<a href="Heat%20Wave%20%28Irving%20Berlin%20song%29">Heat Wave</a>". Roger Ebert considered Williams' performance to be the film's prime asset and credited her for successfully evoking multiple aspects of Monroe's personality. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> opined that despite not physically resembling Monroe, she had "with fierce artistry and feeling [illuminated] Monroe's insights and insecurities about herself at the height of her fame". Williams won a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress</a> and received her second consecutive Oscar nomination for it.

In <a href="Sarah%20Polley">Sarah Polley</a>'s romance "<a href="Take%20This%20Waltz%20%28film%29">Take This Waltz</a>" (2011), co-starring <a href="Seth%20Rogen">Seth Rogen</a> and <a href="Luke%20Kirby">Luke Kirby</a>, Williams played a married writer attracted to her neighbor. Though the actress considered it to be a light-hearted film, Jenny McCartney of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" found a darker undertone to it and favorably compared its theme to that of "Blue Valentine". To play a part that would appeal to her daughter, Williams starred as <a href="Glinda%20the%20Good%20Witch">Glinda the Good Witch</a> in <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a>'s fantasy picture "<a href="Oz%20the%20Great%20and%20Powerful">Oz the Great and Powerful</a>" (2013). Based on the <a href="List%20of%20Oz%20books">"Oz" children's books</a>, it served as a prequel to the 1939 classic film "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>". It marked her first appearance in a film involving special effects and she credited Raimi for making her comfortable with the process. The film earned over $490million worldwide to emerge as one of her highest-grossing releases. "<a href="Suite%20Fran%C3%A7aise%20%28film%29">Suite Française</a>", a period drama that Williams filmed in 2013, was released in a few territories in 2015 but was not theatrically distributed in America. She later admitted to being displeased with how the film turned out, adding that she found it hard to predict the quality of a project during production. Eager to work in a different medium and finding it tough to obtain film roles that enabled her to maintain her parental commitments, Williams spent the next few years working on stage.

Williams' desire to star in a musical led her to the role of <a href="Sally%20Bowles">Sally Bowles</a> in a 2014 revival of "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>", which was staged at <a href="Studio%2054">Studio 54</a> and marked her <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut. Jointly directed by <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a> and <a href="Rob%20Marshall">Rob Marshall</a>, it tells the story of a free-spirited <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> performer (Williams) in 1930s Berlin during the rise of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>. Before production began, she spent four months privately rehearsing with music and dance coaches. She read the works of <a href="Christopher%20Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>, whose novel "<a href="Goodbye%20to%20Berlin">Goodbye to Berlin</a>" inspired the musical, and visited Berlin to research Isherwood's life and inspirations. She received mixed reviews for her performance; Jesse Green of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine praised her singing and commitment to the role but "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>"s Linda Winer thought that her portrayal lacked depth. The rigorousness of the assignment led Williams to consider "Cabaret" her toughest project.

Challenged by her work in "Cabaret", Williams was eager to continue working on the stage. She found a part in a 2016 revival of the <a href="David%20Harrower">David Harrower</a> play "<a href="Blackbird%20%28play%29">Blackbird</a>". Set entirely in the lunchroom of an office, it focuses on a young woman, Una (Williams), who confronts a much-older man (played by <a href="Jeff%20Daniels">Jeff Daniels</a>) for having sexual relations with her when she was 12 years old. Williams, who had not seen previous stagings of the play, was drawn to the ambiguity of her character and found herself unable to distance herself from it after each performance. <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" found the actress' "daring and nonjudgmental embodiment of her not easily assimilable character" to be the production's highlight. She received a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play</a> nomination for "Blackbird".

Williams returned to film in 2016 with supporting roles in two small-scale dramas"<a href="Certain%20Women%20%28film%29">Certain Women</a>" and "<a href="Manchester%20by%20the%20Sea%20%28film%29">Manchester by the Sea</a>". The former marked her third collaboration with Kelly Reichardt and told three interconnected narratives based on the short stories of <a href="Maile%20Meloy">Maile Meloy</a>. As with their previous collaborations, the film featured minimal dialogue and required Williams to act through silences. <a href="Kenneth%20Lonergan">Kenneth Lonergan</a>'s "Manchester by the Sea" starred <a href="Casey%20Affleck">Casey Affleck</a> as Lee, a depressed man who separates from his wife, Randy (Williams), following the death of their children. Williams agreed to the project to work with Lonergan, whose work she admired, and in preparation, she visited <a href="Manchester-by-the-Sea%2C%20Massachusetts">Manchester</a> to interview local mothers about their lives. She also worked with a dialect coach to adopt a <a href="New%20England%20English">Massachusetts accent</a>. Despite the film's bleakness, Williams identified with her character's desire to reclaim her life in the face of tragedy. Several journalists took note of Williams' climactic monologue, in which Randy confronts Lee, as the film's highlight; <a href="Justin%20Chang">Justin Chang</a> considered it to be an "astonishing scene that rises from the movie like a small aria of heartbreak". Williams received her fourth Academy Award nomination for the film, her second in the Best Supporting Actress category.
Following a brief appearance in Todd Hayne's drama "<a href="Wonderstruck%20%28film%29">Wonderstruck</a>" (2017), Williams appeared in the musical "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Showman">The Greatest Showman</a>". Inspired by <a href="P.%20T.%20Barnum">P. T. Barnum</a>'s creation of the <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus">Barnum & Bailey Circus</a>, the film featured her as Charity, the wife of Barnum (played by Hugh Jackman). She compared her character's joyful disposition to that of <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>, and she sang two songs for the film's . The film emerged as one of her most successful, earning over $434million worldwide. Williams then took on her first leading film role since 2013 in <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s crime thriller "<a href="All%20the%20Money%20in%20the%20World">All the Money in the World</a>". She starred as Gail Harris, whose son, <a href="John%20Paul%20Getty%20III">John Paul Getty III</a>, is abducted for ransom. She considered it a major opportunity, as she had not headlined a big-budget film before. A month before the film's release, <a href="Kevin%20Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>, who played <a href="J.%20Paul%20Getty">J. Paul Getty</a>, was accused of sexual misconduct. He was replaced with <a href="Christopher%20Plummer">Christopher Plummer</a>, and Williams reshot her scenes days before the release deadline. It was later reported that her co-star <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a> was paid $1.5million to Williams' $1,000 for the reshoots, sparking a debate on <a href="gender%20pay%20gap">gender pay gap</a> in the industry. <a href="David%20Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> of "New York" bemoaned that the controversy had taken attention away from Williams' work and commended her for conveying her character's grief "through the tension in her body and intensity of her voice". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

In 2018, Williams married the musician <a href="Phil%20Elverum">Phil Elverum</a> in a secret ceremony in the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a>. Her first film role that year was as a haughty but insecure executive in the <a href="Amy%20Schumer">Amy Schumer</a>-starring comedy "<a href="I%20Feel%20Pretty%20%28film%29">I Feel Pretty</a>", which satirizes <a href="body%20image">body image</a> issues among women. The comic role, which required her to speak in a high-pitched voice, marked a departure from her previous assignments, and Peter Debruge of "Variety" considered it to be "the funniest performance of her career". It was a modest box office success. In a continued effort to work in different genres, Williams played <a href="Anne%20Weying">Anne Weying</a> in the superhero film "<a href="Venom%20%282018%20film%29">Venom</a>", co-starring <a href="Tom%20Hardy">Tom Hardy</a> as the <a href="Venom%20%28Marvel%20Comics%20character%29">titular antihero</a>. Influenced by the <a href="Me%20Too%20movement">Me Too movement</a>, she provided off-screen inputs regarding her character's wardrobe and dialogue, but critic <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> felt that it was "an outrageously boring and submissive role". "Venom" earned over $855million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in which Williams has appeared.

Williams returned to the Sundance Film Festival in 2019 with "<a href="After%20the%20Wedding%20%282019%20film%29">After the Wedding</a>", a remake of <a href="Susanne%20Bier">Susanne Bier</a>'s Danish <a href="After%20the%20Wedding">film of the same name</a>, in which Williams and <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a> played roles portrayed by men in the original. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" Benjamin Lee considered it to be a reminder of Williams' "ability to bring nuance and empathy to smaller, more intimate fare" after playing "ill-fitting roles" in the previous year. Also in 2019, Williams will star opposite <a href="Sam%20Rockwell">Sam Rockwell</a> in "<a href="Fosse/Verdon">Fosse/Verdon</a>", an <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> miniseries based on the relationship between <a href="Bob%20Fosse">Bob Fosse</a> and <a href="Gwen%20Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a>. Among other upcoming projects, she has committed to portray the singer <a href="Janis%20Joplin">Janis Joplin</a> in a biopic directed by <a href="Sean%20Durkin">Sean Durkin</a>, and will star in <a href="Kimberly%20Peirce">Kimberly Peirce</a>'s "This is Jane", a historical drama about the <a href="Jane%20Collective">Jane Collective</a> service. She was cast alongside <a href="Adam%20Driver">Adam Driver</a> in <a href="Leos%20Carax">Leos Carax</a>'s "Annette", an experimental musical about a stand-up comedian's supernaturally gifted child, after <a href="Rooney%20Mara">Rooney Mara</a> backed out of the project.

Describing Williams' off-screen persona, Debbie McQuoid of "<a href="Stylist%20%28magazine%29">Stylist</a>" wrote in 2016 that she is "predictably petite but her poise and posture make her seem larger than life". The journalist <a href="Andrew%20Anthony">Andrew Anthony</a> has described her as unpretentious, low-key, and unassuming. Charles McGrath of "The New York Times" considers Williams to be unlike a movie star and has called her "shy, earnest, thoughtful, and [...] a little wary of publicity". Williams has spoken about how she tries to balance her desire to be private and her wish to use her celebrity status to speak out against issues such as sexism, gender pay gap, and sexual harassment.

Following the death of Heath Ledger, Williams became the subject of intense media scrutiny and was frequently stalked by <a href="paparazzi">paparazzi</a>. She disliked the attention, saying that it interfered with her work and made her self-conscious. Although she refused to publicly discuss her relationships, she was forthright in expressing her grief over Ledger's death, saying that it had left a permanent hole in her and her daughter's life. Williams has since affirmed her determination to care for her daughter in spite of her difficulties as a single mother. In 2018, she opened up about her romantic relationship and marriage with Phil Elverum to provide grieving women inspiration in her story.

Williams prefers to work in small-scale independent films over big-budget productions, finding them to be "a very natural expression of my interest". Elaine Lipworth of "The Daily Telegraph" has identified a theme of "dark, often tragic characters" in her career, while Katie O'Malley of "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" believes that she specializes in "playing strong, independent and forthright female characters". When asked about her choice of roles, Williams has said that she is drawn towards "people’s failings, blind spots, inconsistencies". She agrees to a project on instinct, calling it an "un-thought out process". Describing her acting process in 2008, she said:

Acting sometimes reminds me of therapy in that the more you talk about a traumatic or profound event, the more it loses its emotional tension. [The trick is] to live in so much mystery, to rely on a feeling, an instinct, on faith, really, that everything I need is already inside me, and best I just don’t block the exit.

<a href="Erica%20Wagner">Erica Wagner</a> of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" has praised Williams for combining "startlingly emotional performance with a sense of groundedness" and the critic <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> writes that she "can play anyone, without undue glamour or starriness". <a href="Adam%20Green%20%28journalist%29">Adam Green</a> of "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" finds Williams' ability to reveal "the inner lives of her characters in unguarded moments" to be her trademark, and credits her for not "trading on her sex appeal" despite her willingness to perform nude scenes. Kenneth Lonergan, who directed her in "Manchester by the Sea", has said that her versatility allows her to be "transformed, in her whole person" by the role she plays. Describing her career in 2016, Boris Kachka of "Elle" termed it a metamorphosis from "celebrated indie ingenue to muscular, chameleonic movie star".

Williams has featured as the brand ambassador for the fashion label <a href="Band%20of%20Outsiders%20%28clothing%20brand%29">Band of Outsiders</a> and the luxury brand <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>. She has appeared in several advertisement campaigns for the latter company, and in 2015, she starred alongside <a href="Alicia%20Vikander">Alicia Vikander</a> in their short film named "The Spirit of Travel".

According to the review-aggregate site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and the box office site <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, Williams' highest-grossing and most acclaimed films include "<a href="The%20Station%20Agent">The Station Agent</a>" (2003), "<a href="Brokeback%20Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a>" (2005), "<a href="Wendy%20and%20Lucy">Wendy and Lucy</a>" (2008), "<a href="Blue%20Valentine%20%28film%29">Blue Valentine</a>" (2010), "<a href="Shutter%20Island%20%28film%29">Shutter Island</a>" (2010), "<a href="Meek%27s%20Cutoff%20%28film%29">Meek's Cutoff</a>" (2010), "<a href="My%20Week%20with%20Marilyn">My Week with Marilyn</a>" (2011), "<a href="Oz%20the%20Great%20and%20Powerful">Oz the Great and Powerful</a>" (2013), "<a href="Manchester%20by%20the%20Sea%20%28film%29">Manchester by the Sea</a>" (2016), "<a href="Certain%20Women%20%28film%29">Certain Women</a>" (2016), "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Showman">The Greatest Showman</a>" (2017), and "<a href="Venom%20%282018%20film%29">Venom</a>" (2018). Among her stage roles, she has appeared on Broadway in revivals of "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>" in 2014 and "<a href="Blackbird%20%28play%29">Blackbird</a>" in 2016.

Williams has been nominated for four <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for "Brokeback Mountain" (2005) and "Manchester by the Sea" (2016); and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for "Blue Valentine" (2010) and "My Week with Marilyn" (2011). She won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical</a> for "My Week with Marilyn" (2011) and has been nominated five more times: Best Actress in a Drama for "Blue Valentine" (2010) and "<a href="All%20the%20Money%20in%20the%20World">All the Money in the World</a>" (2017); and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Best Supporting Actress</a>, for "Brokeback Mountain" (2005) and "Manchester by the Sea" (2016). Williams has also received a nomination for the <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play</a> for "Blackbird".

New Worlds (magazine)

New Worlds was a British <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> that began in 1936 as a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> called "Novae Terrae". <a href="John%20Carnell">John Carnell</a>, who became "Novae Terrae"s editor in 1939, renamed it "New Worlds" that year. He was instrumental in turning it into a professional publication in 1946 and was the first editor of the new incarnation. It became the leading UK science fiction magazine; the period to 1960 has been described by science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> as the magazine's "Golden Age".

Carnell joined the British Army in 1940 following the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and returned to civilian life in 1946. He negotiated a publishing agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications, but only three issues of "New Worlds" were subsequently produced before Pendulum's bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management appeared in mid-1949. "New Worlds" continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20, published in early 1953, following which a change of printers led to a hiatus in publication. In early 1954, when Maclaren & Sons acquired control of Nova Publications, the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule.

"New Worlds" was acquired by Roberts & Vinter in 1964, when <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a> became editor. By the end of 1966 financial problems with their distributor led Roberts & Vinter to abandon "New Worlds", but with the aid of an <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Arts Council</a> grant obtained by <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, Moorcock was able to publish the magazine independently. He featured a good deal of experimental and "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>" material, and "New Worlds" became the focus of the "<a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave</a>" of science fiction. Reaction among the science fiction community was mixed, with partisans and opponents of the New Wave debating the merits of "New Worlds" in the columns of fanzines such as "Zenith-Speculation". Several of the regular contributors during this period, including Brian Aldiss, <a href="J.%20G.%20Ballard">J. G. Ballard</a>, <a href="Thomas%20M.%20Disch">Thomas M. Disch</a> and Moorcock himself became major names in the field. By 1970 Moorcock was too deeply in debt to be able to continue with the magazine, and it became a paperback quarterly after issue 201. The title has been revived multiple times, with Moorcock's direct involvement or approval; by 2012, 21 additional issues had appeared in various formats, including several anthologies.

In 1926, <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> launched "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first science fiction (sf) magazine. It was soon followed by other US titles also specialising in sf, such as "<a href="Astounding%20Stories">Astounding Stories</a>" and "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>". These were distributed in the UK, and British fan organisations began to appear. In 1936, Maurice K. Hanson, a <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fan</a> living in <a href="Nuneaton">Nuneaton</a>, founded a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> called "Novae Terrae" (Latin for "new lands" or "new worlds") for the local branch of the <a href="Science%20Fiction%20League">Science Fiction League</a>. Hanson moved to London and his fanzine became the official publication of the <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Association">Science Fiction Association</a>, founded in 1937.

<a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, <a href="John%20Carnell">John Carnell</a> and <a href="William%20F.%20Temple">William F. Temple</a> became involved in "Novae Terrae"s production. In 1939 Hanson gave up the editorship to Carnell, who retitled the fanzine "New Worlds" and restarted the numbering at volume 1 number 1; the first issue under Carnell's control was dated March 1939. Carnell wanted to turn "New Worlds" into a professional magazine, and through <a href="W.J.%20Passingham">W.J. Passingham</a>, a writer, had begun discussions with a publisher named The Worlds Says Ltd. In January 1940 Carnell was asked to put together three issues, and Carnell and Passingham each put up £50 towards costs. Carnell solicited material from British authors including <a href="John%20F.%20Burke">John F. Burke</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Youd">C.S. Youd</a>, and <a href="David%20McIlwain">David McIlwain</a>, and acquired <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s "Lost Legion", but in March internal strife led to the collapse of The World Says. Alfred Greig, the director, returned to his native Canada without repaying Carnell and Passingham, and no issues were ever printed.

Carnell joined the army in 1940, serving with the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, Combined Operations, and Naval Bombardment. After his return to civilian life in January 1946 he met writer <a href="Frank%20Edward%20Arnold">Frank Edward Arnold</a>, who had been working with Pendulum Publications on a new science fiction line. Arnold introduced Carnell to <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Frances">Stephen D. Frances</a>, Pendulum's director. Frances believed in the commercial possibilities of science fiction, and since Carnell still had the portfolio of stories he had put together in 1940, Pendulum agreed to make "New Worlds" into a professional magazine. The first issue appeared in July 1946, although there was no date on the magazine. The initial print run was 15,000, but only 3,000 copies were sold—a very disappointing return. Carnell felt that the cover artwork, which he considered to be weak, was partly responsible for the poor sales. He put together a new design, based on covers from two US science fiction magazines, and gave it to artist Victor Caesari to complete. The resulting space scene was the cover for the second issue, which appeared in October 1946; in combination with Pendulum's investment in promoting the magazine this led to much better sales, and the second issue sold out completely. Pendulum rebound the remaining copies of the first issue with the second cover design, and repriced them at <a href="%C2%A3sd">1/6</a> (7.5p); the first two issues had been priced at 2/- (10p). The new cover and price were much more popular and the repackaged first issue, like the second, soon sold out.

Pendulum Publications produced one more issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving "New Worlds" without a publisher. The magazine was saved by a group of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse <a href="public%20house">public house</a> on New Fetter Lane, near <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a>. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive "New Worlds"; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.

In May 1948 Carnell announced at a science fiction convention in London that plans were well underway to form a new company, to be called Nova Publications Ltd. Nova raised £600 in capital and was launched in early 1949. There were initially six directors: the chairman was <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, and the remaining board members were G. Ken Chapman, Frank Cooper, <a href="Walter%20Gillings">Walter Gillings</a>, Eric C. Williams, and John Carnell. A printer was found near <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a>, where Frank Cooper was based, and the first issue (numbered 4, to follow on from the three Pendulum issues) appeared in June. It was planned to move to regular quarterly publication, and subsequently to a bimonthly schedule. To keep costs down Nova decided to handle the distribution themselves; this was not easy but Cooper and his assistant, Les Flood, were sufficiently successful that in July the decision was taken to go ahead with the planned quarterly schedule. A fifth issue appeared in September, and the sixth issue early the following year, dated Spring 1950.

In 1950, with "New Worlds" on a stable quarterly schedule, Nova Publications decided to launch a companion, "<a href="Science%20Fantasy%20%28magazine%29">Science Fantasy</a>". They chose Walter Gillings as the editor; but he was replaced by Carnell after two issues, partly because Nova could not afford to pay two editorial salaries, and partly because of "fundamental differences of opinion". At the end of 1951 "New Worlds" went bimonthly, and by the middle of the year had reached a circulation of 18,000. The price had been reduced to 1/6 with the third issue, but with paper costs rising Nova looked for a cheaper printer. The new printer, The Carlton Press, was supposed to take over production with the May 1953 issue (number 21), but the issue was late, and had to be dated June 1953 instead. The issue was shoddily produced, which dismayed Nova's board, and printers' strikes caused further delays. Nova discovered that The Carlton Press was an agent with no printing facilities; they farmed out work to other printers, but were only able to get their commissions executed when they paid off any prior debts to those printers. Issue 22 was repeatedly delayed; proofs appeared in August, and the issue was promised for November. Even this schedule was not adhered to, and Carnell received a copy of the print run in January 1954. The copy was dated 1953 (with no month), and since this made it useless for distribution in 1954, Carnell refused to accept the print run. While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell's, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith covered the conference for "<a href="Illustrated%20%28magazine%29">Illustrated</a>", a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of <a href="Maclaren%20%26amp%3B%20Sons%20Ltd">Maclaren & Sons Ltd</a>, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova, with a commitment to produce "New Worlds" on a monthly basis and "Science Fantasy" on a bimonthly schedule. By January 1954, when The Carlton Press delivered the incorrectly dated issue 22, the acquisition by Maclaren was complete, and Maclaren's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute. The printing press which had printed the issue was not paid by The Carlton Press, so an injunction was obtained that sequestered the issues to avoid them being sold to recover the printing costs. Carnell retained the copy he had been sent in January, and it is thought that this is the only copy that exists of The Carlton Press's version of this issue, as the remainder of the printing run was destroyed after the court case. The cover painting, by <a href="Gerard%20Quinn">Gerard Quinn</a>, was subsequently used on issue 13 of "Science Fantasy", and all the stories and editorial material eventually appeared in later issues of "New Worlds" over the next year.

The financial support that Maclaren provided meant that once issue 22 appeared in April 1954, it was the start of a regular monthly schedule that lasted until 1964 with just one hiccup: a printing dispute in 1959 delayed the August issue and it was combined with the September issue. Despite this stability, "New Worlds"s circulation began to decline in the early 1960s. Nova Publications had launched a third magazine, "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Adventures%20%28British%20magazine%29">Science Fiction Adventures</a>", in 1958, but both it and "Science Fantasy" were also losing readers, and in May 1963 "Science Fiction Adventures" was cancelled. In September of that year Nova's board decided to close down both "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy", and in preparation for the change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, "<a href="New%20Writings%20in%20SF">New Writings in SF</a>", for publisher <a href="Dennis%20Dobson">Dennis Dobson</a>.

The magazines were unexpectedly saved by David Warburton of <a href="Roberts%20%26amp%3B%20Vinter">Roberts & Vinter</a>, a London publishing house. The printer who had been printing both "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy" happened to meet Warburton in a pub, and mentioned that he was looking for additional work to fill the gaps in his schedule left by the demise of the magazines. Roberts & Vinter were having difficulty getting good distribution for their existing titles, which were violent thrillers, and were interested in acquiring more respectable titles that would help them penetrate the British distribution network, which was heavily dependent on <a href="W.H.%20Smith">W.H. Smith</a> and <a href="John%20Menzies">John Menzies</a>, the two main British newsagent chains. Warburton's partner, Godfrey Gold, ran a company that was connected to Roberts & Vinter and published <a href="pin-up%20girl">pin-up</a> magazines; like Warburton, Gold needed to improve his ability to distribute his titles.

When Michael Moorcock, who by this time had begun selling stories to Carnell, heard of the plans to cease publication of "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy", he wrote a letter that appeared in issue 141 lamenting the loss to the British science fiction field of both the magazines and Carnell himself. Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to "New Writings in SF", and recommended Moorcock to Warburton. <a href="Kyril%20Bonfiglioli">Kyril Bonfiglioli</a>, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose "New Worlds", and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of "Science Fantasy". Moorcock wanted to switch to a large format, and showed Warburton a dummy issue he had made up, but Warburton insisted on a paperback format in order to fit in with the other titles they were producing, though he agreed to revisit the format in the future if sales improved. The first issue under Moorcock's control was number 142, dated May/June 1964. The schedule was initially bimonthly, but at the start of 1965 it returned to a stable monthly schedule.

In July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts & Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to focus on their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds". After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing "New Worlds", and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as <a href="J.B.%20Priestley">J.B. Priestley</a>, <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>, <a href="Marghanita%20Laski">Marghanita Laski</a>, and <a href="Angus%20Wilson">Angus Wilson</a> to gain support for an application for a grant from the <a href="British%20Arts%20Council">British Arts Council</a> in late 1966. In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that "New Worlds" would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the grant certification was delayed until at least May. The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. A publisher still had to be found, and both <a href="Fontana%20Books">Fontana</a> and <a href="Panther%20Books">Panther Books</a> expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories. Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the <a href="indicia%20%28publishing%29">indicia</a>. "Science Fantasy", which by this time had been retitled "SF Impulse", was not continued but was merged with "New Worlds" as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of "SF Impulse"s design or content was visible in "New Worlds".

The partnership Warburton and Moorcock formed to continue "New Worlds" was named Magnelist Publications. Moorcock and Warburton reviewed the dummy issue Moorcock had put together when he first became editor, and Warburton agreed to switch to the larger format. The first issue from Magnelist appeared in July 1967, beginning a regular monthly schedule. Moorcock remained as editor with Langdon Jones as his assistant, and Charles Platt became the layout designer. Poor sales led Warburton to cease his involvement after the November issue, but the magazine was again saved, this time by <a href="Sylvester%20Stein">Sylvester Stein</a> of Stonehart Publications.

Delays led to a skipped month, with the December 1967 and January 1968 issues being combined into one, but a monthly schedule returned thereafter. The March 1968 issue contained the third instalment of <a href="Norman%20Spinrad">Norman Spinrad</a>'s novel "<a href="Bug%20Jack%20Barron">Bug Jack Barron</a>", which included some fairly explicit sex scenes. A member of parliament complained in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> that the Arts Council was "sponsoring filth"; and soon W.H. Smith and John Menzies, the two main retail outlets for magazines in the UK, withdrew the magazine from sale. The complaints came at the time when the Arts Council was considering renewing the grant for another year, and it appeared for a while that "New Worlds" would have to cease publication, but eventually the grant was renewed. With money from advertising, and a substantial contribution from Moorcock himself, the magazine was able to survive. The loss of revenue caused by the withdrawal from sale of the March 1968 issue was exacerbated by a temporary ban on the magazine in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and by John Menzies' subsequent decision not to stock "New Worlds". W.H. Smith left it to their individual branch managers to decide whether or not to carry the magazine. Stonehart were unhappy with developments and refused to pay the printers, who in turn withheld the printed copies. The Arts Council money had been intended for the contributors, but a disagreement over the grant led to Stonehart<nowiki>'s refusal to pay them as well. Some negative coverage appeared in the press as a consequence of the distribution ban. The grant was eventually renewed, but by late that year Stein had had enough. Stonehart ceased their involvement with "New Worlds"</nowiki> after the July 1968 issue.

Without reliable distribution at the leading newsagents, "New Worlds" had to rely on subscriptions and donations. The magazine was not profitable, and since Moorcock had not formed a company to publish it, he was personally responsible for its costs. To bring in cash he had been writing fantasy novels at a very rapid rate since early 1968, and from early 1969 the editorial work was given to various others, primarily Charles Platt and Langdon Jones. A regular monthly schedule was adhered to from January until July 1969, at which point came another financial blow when it was discovered that half of the print run of 20,000 was being held back by the distributors. Moorcock attempted to regroup by reducing the number of pages in each issue, and because he was again forced to write as much as he could to earn enough to pay "New Worlds"s bills, he turned over almost all editorial duties to Charles Platt, though others involved with the magazine also took turns at the editorial work over the next few issues. Moorcock was £3,000 in debt, and in combination with the Arts Council's decision not to renew their grant he found himself with no option but to cease publication on a monthly schedule and arrange a quarterly schedule in paperback format published by Sphere. The April 1970 issue, the 200th, was the last that went out to the distributors; one more issue was prepared and posted to subscribers as the 'Special Good Taste Issue' the following March.

When Moorcock realised that the magazine would have to fold, he made arrangements with <a href="Sphere%20Books">Sphere Books</a> to continue "New Worlds" as a quarterly paperback anthology series. Sphere produced eight issues, although the quarterly schedule was not adhered to after the fourth issue; the eighth issue appeared in 1975. Six issues were reprinted in the US. The early issues did well financially, with about 25,000 copies sold, not counting US sales. Moorcock turned over the editorship to Charles Platt with the sixth volume, and to Hilary Bailey thereafter, to give himself more time to devote to his own writing: he also commented that by this time "I no longer had my editorial touch (I couldn't read sf at all)". Sphere cancelled the series after two more issues; it was briefly taken over by <a href="Corgi%20Books">Corgi Books</a>, but sales were weak and Corgi dropped the series with "New Worlds 10" in 1976, although according to Moorcock he and Bailey decided to end the series when they got into disagreements with Corgi. In the US <a href="Berkley%20Books">Berkley Books</a> published volumes 1 through 4, and when they dropped the series Platt, who was a consulting editor at <a href="Avon%20Books">Avon Books</a>, reprinted two further volumes, number 6 and 7 of the UK series.

In 1978 the magazine was revived by Moorcock again, this time in a fanzine format. Four more issues appeared, professionally printed and with various editors, between Spring 1978 and September 1979. There followed a gap until 1991, when "New Worlds" again reappeared as a paperback anthology series, this time edited by <a href="David%20S.%20Garnett">David S. Garnett</a>. Four volumes appeared between 1991 and 1994, published by <a href="Victor%20Gollancz%20Ltd">Victor Gollancz</a>. Moorcock edited a fiftieth anniversary issue in 1996, and Garnett subsequently edited one more issue of the anthology. Together with the earlier fanzine, magazine and anthology versions, these took the issue numbering from 212 through to 222.

The lead story of the first issue of "New Worlds" was <a href="Maurice%20Hugi">Maurice Hugi</a>'s "The Mill of the Gods". <a href="John%20Russell%20Fearn">John Russell Fearn</a> contributed four stories, under his own name and three pseudonyms, and William Temple provided "The Three Pylons", a fantasy which turned out to be the most popular story in the issue. Science fiction historian Mike Ashley regards the next two issues as an improvement on the first; the second issue contained John Wyndham's "The Living Lies", under his "John Beynon" alias, and the third contained "Inheritance", an early story by Arthur C. Clarke. Wyndham's story, about hostility and bigotry shown by settlers on Venus to the Venusian natives, was reprinted in "<a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">Other Worlds</a>" in 1950, while "Inheritance" later appeared in "Astounding Science Fiction".

The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren in 1954 gave "New Worlds" the stability to establish itself as a leading magazine. Ashley describes the period from 1954 to 1960 as a "Golden Age" for "New Worlds". Carnell bought <a href="J.%20G.%20Ballard">J. G. Ballard</a>'s first sale, "Escapement", which appeared in the December 1956 "New Worlds"; Ballard went on to become a significant figure in the genre in the 1960s. Ballard was grateful to Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s. Much of Ballard's work appeared in "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy", and Ballard later recalled that Carnell "recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he encouraged me to go on writing in my own way." Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds". <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with "Visitors' Book" in the April 1955 "New Worlds". <a href="James%20White%20%28author%29">James White</a> began publishing with "Assisted Passage" in the January 1953 "New Worlds", and in 1957 began his popular <a href="Sector%20General">Sector General</a> series, about a hospital for aliens, with "Sector General" in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Triffids">The Day of the Triffids</a>", began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with "For All the Night" in the April 1958 issue. Arthur C. Clarke, another successful British sf writer of the period, wrote relatively few short stories for the British market, but published "Who's There" in the November 1958 "New Worlds". Colin Kapp began his popular "Unorthodox Engineers" series with "The Railways up on Cannis", in October 1959. Other less well-known writers who were prolific during the late 1950s included <a href="J.%20T.%20McIntosh">J. T. McIntosh</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Bulmer">Kenneth Bulmer</a>, and <a href="E.%20C.%20Tubb">E. C. Tubb</a>.

"New Worlds" has been credited with "shap[ing] the way science fiction developed" as a genre. It "did the most" of any magazine for British science fiction, helping to revive a nationalist style of speculative fiction in the 1950s; Roger Luckhurst called it "the most important British sf journal". Particularly influential were Clarke's "Guardian Angel" (published in 1950), and the work of Brian Aldiss, John Brunner and J. G. Ballard. Mike Ashley argued that "New Worlds" and "Science-Fantasy" were "the bedrock of high-quality science fiction in Britain". Female readership for the magazine was between 5 and 15 percent, according to surveys conducted during the 1950s. The magazine became increasingly popular among a younger demographic: readers 19 and under made up 5 percent of total readership in 1954, 18 percent in 1958, and 31 percent in 1963. The same polls also showed an increase in the number of science and technology workers reading the magazine during that period. Among the best artists of this period were <a href="Brian%20Lewis%20%28illustrator%29">Brian Lewis</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Hutchings">Gordon Hutchings</a>, and Gerard Quinn, whose art is regarded by Ashley as comparable in style to <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>'s work. In 1957 Carnell stopped using interior art, saying that "art work in the digest-size magazines is as out-of-date as a coal fire".

In Ashley's view, the quality of "New Worlds" began to drop in the early 1960s. It still ran popular series such as White's Sector General stories, and printed some well-received stories such as <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>'s "The Streets of Ashkelon", about a clash between an atheist (the protagonist) and a priest, on another planet. Because of the subject matter, it took six years for Harrison to find an editor willing to accept the story; when Aldiss bought it for an anthology, Carnell agreed to print it in "New Worlds", where it appeared in September 1962. J.G. Ballard continued to publish in "New Worlds", but was now sending his more conventional stories to the US magazines, and submitting his more experimental pieces to Carnell. Examples from 1961 to 1964 include "The Overloaded Man", "The Subliminal Man", "End-Game", and "The Terminal Beach", with themes of psychological stress, and changes to the nature of perception and of reality.

When Roberts & Vinter made the decision to close down "New Worlds" in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: "It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, "Playboy" so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [William] Burroughs and [Eduardo] <a href="Eduardo%20Paolozzi">Paolozzi</a>, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: "Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of "New Worlds", though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.

Moorcock's first issue, dated May/June 1964, bore a cover by <a href="James%20Cawthorn">James Cawthorn</a> illustrating the first instalment of Ballard's novella "Equinox"; Ballard also contributed a book review of <a href="William%20Burroughs">William Burroughs</a>' "<a href="Dead%20Fingers%20Talk">Dead Fingers Talk</a>", and stories by Brian Aldiss, Barrington Bayley, and John Brunner completed the issue. Moorcock's editorial included a quote from a radio interview with William Burroughs to the effect that "If writers are to describe the advanced techniques of the Space Age, they must invent writing techniques equally advanced in order properly to deal with them." Within the first few issues, Moorcock printed stories intended to demonstrate his editorial goals. The most controversial of these was Langdon Jones' "I Remember, Anita ...", which appeared in the September/October 1964 issue; the story contained sex scenes that led to arguments in the magazine's letter column, and some regular subscribers abandoned the magazines, though overall circulation increased.

Moorcock contributed a substantial amount of material, under his own name and under pseudonyms such as <a href="James%20Colvin%20%28pseudonym%29">James Colvin</a>; some of these stories were fairly traditional, but contributions such as the <a href="Jerry%20Cornelius">Jerry Cornelius</a> stories, which began with "Preliminary Data" in the August 1965 issue, were much more experimental. He also printed his novella "Behold the Man" in the September 1966 issue; the story, about a time traveller who returns to the time of Christ, won him a <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a> the following year. Ballard also began to write some of his most controversial stories, including "You: Coma: Marilyn Monroe" in the June 1966 issue, and "The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race", in March 1967; both had been previously published in "<a href="Ambit%20%28magazine%29">Ambit</a>", a literary magazine, in 1966.

Many writers now found "New Worlds" to be a market in which they could publish experimental material. Charles Platt, <a href="David%20I.%20Masson">David I. Masson</a>, and Barrington Bayley were among the British writers in this group, and Moorcock also attracted work from US writers such as <a href="John%20Sladek">John Sladek</a>, <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> and <a href="Thomas%20M.%20Disch">Thomas M. Disch</a>. Zelazny's contributions included "For a Breath I Tarry" in March 1966, and Disch published several short stories and the novel "Echo Round His Bones", which was serialized starting in the December 1966 and January 1967 issues. Disch commented that he had been unable to find a publisher for the novel in the US.

In the mid-1960s, the term "<a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave</a>" began to be applied to the more experimental work that Moorcock was publishing, and "New Worlds" was soon regarded as the leading publication in the New Wave movement. In addition to the experimental material, Moorcock attempted to keep the existing readership happy by publishing more traditional science fiction; in the words of sf historian <a href="Colin%20Greenland">Colin Greenland</a>, he "changed the contents of the magazine much more slowly than he pretended to". Traditional sf stories bought by Moorcock include <a href="Vernor%20Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a>'s first story, "Apartness", which appeared in June 1965; he also printed material from <a href="Bob%20Shaw">Bob Shaw</a>, early stories by <a href="Terry%20Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, and, in March 1965, Arthur C. Clarke's "Sunjammer".

When Moorcock took over publication of "New Worlds" from Roberts & Vinter he changed the format from digest to a larger size with good quality paper that allowed better use of artwork. The first issue in this format, July 1967, contained part one of Disch's "<a href="Camp%20Concentration">Camp Concentration</a>", written for the magazine and refused by its American publisher because of the explicit language used by the protagonist. Disch afterwards recalled that some of the experimental language in the book was written in the knowledge that "New Worlds" was available as a market for unconventional fiction. Other new writers who appeared in the magazine include <a href="M.%20John%20Harrison">M. John Harrison</a> and <a href="Robert%20Holdstock">Robert Holdstock</a>, who both appeared in the November 1968 issue, and <a href="Michael%20Butterworth%20%28author%29">Michael Butterworth</a> whose work first appeared in the May 1966 edition. The December 1968 issue included <a href="Samuel%20R.%20Delany">Samuel R. Delany</a>'s "<a href="Time%20Considered%20as%20a%20Helix%20of%20Semi-Precious%20Stones">Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones</a>", and <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>'s "<a href="A%20Boy%20and%20His%20Dog">A Boy and His Dog</a>" appeared in April 1969; Ellison won a Nebula Award, and Delany both a Nebula and a <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo</a>, though it was not until the stories were reprinted in book form that they were widely noticed.

The July 1967 issue of "New Worlds" contained <a href="Pamela%20Zoline">Pamela Zoline</a>'s first story, "The Heat Death of the Universe", which used <a href="entropy">entropy</a>, a frequent theme in "New Worlds", as a metaphor. The story is one of the best examples of the new approach Moorcock was taking with the magazine: in the words of critic Edward James, the goal was to "use science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life, and by doing so produce altered perceptions of reality in the reader". "Inner space", a term originally coined by <a href="J.B.%20Priestley">J.B. Priestley</a>, was also used to describe the focus of the stories Moorcock printed, in contrast to traditional science fiction's focus on outer space, and James regards the term as "the watchword of the British New Wave, and the shibboleth by which one recognized those who had abandoned Gernsback and Campbell." The methods and interests of these writers were quite different from those of traditional science fiction: the concern was with internal rather than external reality, and experimental techniques, unusual juxtapositions of material, and a focus on psychological concerns were the norm.

With the switch to anthology format, some of the more experimental material disappeared. In his editorials, Moorcock made it clear that he did not want to exclude traditional sf stories; he wanted to eliminate the genre boundaries completely, and have science fiction treated as part of the mainstream of fiction. The quarterlies were labelled as science fiction since Sphere knew that would increase sales. The stories printed in the anthologies were generally downbeat. Some of the material had been intended for "Sword & Sorcery", a magazine planned as a companion to "<a href="Vision%20of%20Tomorrow">Vision of Tomorrow</a>", but which folded before its first issue appeared. New writers who appeared for the first time in the quarterly anthology series included <a href="Marta%20Randall">Marta Randall</a> (under the name Marta Bergstrasser), <a href="Eleanor%20Arnason">Eleanor Arnason</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Ryman">Geoff Ryman</a>, and <a href="Rachel%20Pollack">Rachel Pollack</a> (as Richard A. Pollack).

Issue 212 reprinted a piece written by Moorcock and M. John Harrison that was a spoof issue of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"; it had been published in "<a href="Friends%20%28magazine%29">Frendz</a>", an underground paper, in 1971. The next two issues also contained mock newspaper stories; issue 215 contained more conventional material, including a Jerry Cornelius story written by Charles Partington. Issue 216, the last of the late 1970s issues, reintroduced the mock news stories. The 1990s anthology series did not try to recapture the atmosphere or style of the 1960s or 1970s "New Worlds". It contained some well-received material, including stories by Moorcock, <a href="Paul%20Di%20Filippo">Paul Di Filippo</a>, and <a href="Ian%20McDonald%20%28British%20author%29">Ian McDonald</a>, but was financially unsuccessful.

"New Worlds" greatest influence on science fiction came in the 1960s, with the "New Wave" that began with Moorcock's polemical editorials. Moorcock asserted in 1965 that a writer of good sf "can learn from his predecessors, but he should not imitate them"; and he was soon publishing stories that were quite different in technique and style from anything that had appeared before, not just in "New Worlds" itself, but in any of the sf magazines. Moorcock's goal was to use the magazine to "define a new avant-garde role" for the genre. "New Worlds" thus became the "ideological center of the [New Wave] movement to rejuvenate conjectural literature".

The term "New Wave" did not always meet with approval among those who were regarded as part of it. Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was "a journalistic invention of yours and Mike Moorcock's", and added "I feel I am no part of the New Wave; I was here before 'em, and by God I mean to be here after they've gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!" Merril was an important advocate for "New Worlds" and the New Wave, and popularized the latter in her anthology "England Swings SF", which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term "New Wave" to describe the work being done in "New Worlds", but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern US sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write", which he saw as "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory."

Whatever the exact definition of the term, between 1964 and 1966, "New Worlds" was at the forefront of the New Wave movement. Two guest editorials in 1962 and 1963 ("Which way to Inner Space?" by Ballard and "Play with Feeling" by Moorcock) were arguably the "first glimmerings" of New Wave ideas in sf magazines. Latham suggests that these were "the first volleys in the polemical offensive they would launch once [Moorcock] gained control of the magazine and installed [Ballard] as his resident visionary". The response to the New Wave from critics and sf fans was varied. Christopher Priest called "New Worlds" a "New Wave prozine", but lauded the talents of its writers and its experimental stories (with the exception of Ballard's "The Crystal World", which he deemed "tedious and wearying"). Ian McAuley suggested the magazine's editors were "plugging the 'inner-space' jazz for all its worth". Mike Ashley argued that "New Worlds" was instrumental in promoting authors who would not otherwise have been published (a suggestion with which Bould and Butler concur). Ballard was a particular focus of both praise and vehement criticism, and was vigorously defended by Moorcock. Peter Weston took an "even-handed approach" by praising "New Worlds" in "Speculation" editorials, in contrast with his largely negative columnists. Beginning in 1966, US fanzines began responding to "New Worlds" and its detractors, and the debate spread to the professional US magazines as well. Merril praised Disch and Ballard's contributions to "New Worlds" in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction"; <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a> in "Galaxy" rebutted her viewpoint and condemned both authors. Frederik Pohl called "New Worlds" "damned dull", advocating a return to adventure stories. American science fiction authors "were finding it increasingly difficult to avoid partisan alignments in the developing New Wave war" because of the preponderance of columns and letters in American magazines both for and against "New Worlds" and New Wave in general. Latham suggests that "the New Worlds editorial conclave was actively working within fandom to counteract the Old Guard assaults".

By the end of the 1960s, "New Worlds" and the New Wave's connection to and influence on science fiction was becoming tenuous. In the August 1969 issue, Platt asserted that ""New Worlds" is not a science-fiction magazine", and Moorcock likened it to an avant-garde and experimental literary review. The sf world had lost interest in "New Worlds", and it had become, in Ashley's words, "a revolution running out of energy". In the longer term it proved influential, despite the lack of wide acceptance at the time: in the words of sf historian Brian Stableford, "the paths beaten by the "New Worlds" writers are now much more generally in use".

The following table shows the editorial succession at "New Worlds", indicates which issues appeared from which publisher, and gives the format, page count and price of each issue: Dates in [square brackets] indicate the approximate date that an issue was released in cases where a month did not appear on the magazine.

There were US reprints of six of the "New Worlds Quarterly" anthology series. The first four were published by Berkley Books; Avon Books picked up two more of the series after Berkley dropped it, but since the fifth volume had been missed by that time, Avon retitled volumes 6 and 7 as "New Worlds Quarterly 5" and "New Worlds Quarterly 6".

A US reprint edition of "New Worlds" ran briefly in 1960, published by <a href="Great%20American%20Publications">Great American Publications</a>, who at the time were the publishers of "<a href="Fantastic%20Universe">Fantastic Universe</a>", edited by <a href="Hans%20Stefan%20Santesson">Hans Stefan Santesson</a>. The first issue appeared in March 1960; it omitted Carnell's name, and credited Santesson as editor. Although the fiction consisted entirely of reprints, with all but one story coming from the British "New Worlds", this was not declared to the reader. Carnell was unhappy with the results of this attempt to break into the US market, but in the event Great American collapsed later that year and only five issues appeared, on a monthly schedule from March to July. The contents of the issues did not correspond to specific British issues: the majority were taken from "New Worlds" but one story was reprinted from Nova's edition of "Science Fiction Adventures", and three were taken from "Fantastic Universe", which had ceased publication with its March 1960 issue.

Subsequently the British edition was released in the US essentially unchanged, with a cover date delayed by one month, starting with issue 99 (October 1960).

Several anthologies of stories from "New Worlds" have been published, including:

Alien vs. Predator (film)

Alien vs. Predator (also known as AVP) is a 2004 <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction</a> <a href="action%20film">action film</a> written and directed by <a href="Paul%20W.%20S.%20Anderson">Paul W. S. Anderson</a>, and starring <a href="Sanaa%20Lathan">Sanaa Lathan</a>, <a href="Raoul%20Bova">Raoul Bova</a>, <a href="Lance%20Henriksen">Lance Henriksen</a> and <a href="Ewen%20Bremner">Ewen Bremner</a>. It is the first installment of the <a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator">"Alien vs. Predator" franchise</a>, adapting a <a href="fictional%20crossover">crossover</a> bringing together the <a href="eponym">eponym</a>ous creatures of the "<a href="Alien%20%28franchise%29">Alien</a>" and "<a href="Predator%20%28franchise%29">Predator</a>" series, a concept which originated in a <a href="Aliens%20Versus%20Predator%20%28comics%29">1989 comic book</a> written by <a href="Randy%20Stradley">Randy Stradley</a> and <a href="Chris%20Warner%20%28comics%29">Chris Warner</a>. Anderson, together with <a href="Dan%20O%27Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Shusett">Ronald Shusett</a> (both of which previously worked on the "Alien" films), wrote the story, and Anderson and <a href="Shane%20Salerno">Shane Salerno</a> adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by <a href="Aztec%20mythology">Aztec mythology</a>, the comic book series, and the writings of <a href="Erich%20von%20D%C3%A4niken">Erich von Däniken</a>. 

Set in 2004, the film follows a group of archaeologists assembled by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland (as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries) for an expedition to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> to investigate a mysterious heat signal detected by his satellites. Weyland hopes to claim the find for himself and be remembered for it, and his group discovers an ancient pyramid below the surface of an old and abandoned whaling station. <a href="Hieroglyph">Hieroglyph</a>s and <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>s reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for young <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predators</a> who kill <a href="Alien%20%28creature%20in%20Alien%20franchise%29">Aliens</a> as a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a>. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface. 

"Alien vs. Predator" was released on August 13, 2004, in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. In spite of receiving negative reviews, the film grossed over $172 million at the worldwide <a href="box%20office">box office</a>. A sequel, "", was released three years later in 2007.

In 2004, a <a href="satellite">satellite</a> detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath <a href="Bouvet%20Island">Bouvetøya</a>, an island about one thousand miles off the coast of <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (<a href="Lance%20Henriksen">Lance Henriksen</a>) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa "Lex" Woods (<a href="Sanaa%20Lathan">Sanaa Lathan</a>).

As a <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predator</a> ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires an energy beam aimed at the pyramid site. When the team arrives at the abandoned <a href="Whaling">whaling station</a> above the heat source, they find a perfectly circular, unnatural tunnel running directly beneath the ice towards the pyramid. Weyland shows the team satellite images showing that the passage was not there 24 hours ago. The exploration team descend the tunnel and locate the mysterious <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a> and begin to explore it, soon finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons. Inexplicably, all the skeletons appear to have ruptured <a href="Human%20rib%20cage">rib cages</a>.

Meanwhile, three Predators consisting of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill the remaining team members on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and are trapped within it. The <a href="Alien%20%28creature%20in%20Alien%20franchise%29">Alien</a> Queen awakes from <a href="Cryopreservation">cryogenic stasis</a> and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several <a href="facehuggers">facehuggers</a> attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Xenomorphs. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Xenomorphs, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by a Xenomorph, and Weyland buys Lex and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (<a href="Raoul%20Bova">Raoul Bova</a>) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and a Xenomorph with a <a href="shuriken">shuriken</a> before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask.

Through translation of the pyramid's <a href="hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>s, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshiped as gods. Every 100 years they visit Earth to take part in a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a> by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Xenomorphs, creating the "ultimate prey" for the Predators to hunt. As a fail-safe, if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Xenomorphs and themselves. The two deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was a ruse to attract humans to the site for the sole purpose of making new Xenomorphs to hunt.

Lex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Xenomorphs do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by a Xenomorph, leaving only Lex and Scar to fight the Aliens. Scar uses parts of a dead Alien to fashion weapons for Lex and the two form an alliance. The Xenomorph Queen, using her own acidic blood, is freed from her restraints and, along with the other Xenomorphs, begins pursuing Lex and Scar. Just as they are about to escape, Scar detaches and uses bomb in his wrist module to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Xenomorphs and eggs. Lex and Scar reach the surface, however the Xenomorph Queen has survived and continues chasing them. They defeat the Queen by hooking her chains to the exploration team's water supply tank and pushing it over a cliff, dragging her to the ocean floor. Scar, however, had been impaled by the Xenomorph Queen's tail and succumbs to his wounds, dying.

A Predator ship <a href="cloaking%20device">uncloaks</a> and several Predators appear. They retrieve their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Lex with one of their spear weapons as a gift. The other Predators recognize her for her skill as a warrior symbolized by the alien blood Scar burned on her cheek before he died. The Predator's spaceship flies off leaving Lex. Lex walks over to a snowcat and leaves the area. The predators leave Scar's body on a plinth in front of a window. Once the predators leave though, a chestburster with a hybrid form of a Xenomorph and a Predator erupts from Scar's chest.



Before 20th Century Fox gave "Alien vs. Predator" the <a href="greenlight">greenlight</a>, "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" writer/director <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> had been working on a story for a fifth "Alien" film. "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>" director <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> had talked with Cameron, stating "I think it would be a lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film "<a href="Prometheus%20%282012%20film%29">Prometheus</a>" (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue "Alien vs. Predator", Cameron believed the film would "kill the validity of the franchise" and ceased work on his story, "To me, that was "<a href="Frankenstein%20Meets%20the%20Wolf%20Man">Frankenstein Meets Werewolf</a>". It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." After viewing "Alien vs. Predator", however, Cameron remarked that "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five "Alien" films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the "Alien vs. Predator" films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." Director <a href="Neill%20Blomkamp">Neill Blomkamp</a> would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to "Aliens". However, Scott stated in 2017 that the project has been cancelled.

The concept of "Alien vs. Predator" originated from the "<a href="Aliens%20Versus%20Predator%20%28comics%29">Aliens versus Predator</a>" comic book in 1989 by comic book writers <a href="Randy%20Stradley">Randy Stradley</a> and <a href="Chris%20Warner%20%28comics%29">Chris Warner</a>. It was also hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in "<a href="Predator%202">Predator 2</a>". Shortly after the release of "Predator 2", "Predator" co-writer <a href="Jim%20Thomas%20%28screenwriter%29">Jim Thomas</a> discussed the possibilities of a "Predator" franchise and commented on the prospect of a crossover film, stating, "I think Predator vs. Alien is a good idea that will probably never happen". Screenwriter <a href="Peter%20Briggs">Peter Briggs</a> created the original <a href="Spec%20script">spec screenplay</a> in 1990–1991, which was based on the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because the studio was working on "". A draft penned by <a href="James%20DeMonaco">James DeMonaco</a> and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer <a href="John%20Davis%20%28producer%29">John Davis</a>, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.

As there were six producers between the film franchises, "<a href="Predator%20%28film%29">Predator</a>" producer <a href="John%20Davis%20%28producer%29">John Davis</a> had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures. <a href="Paul%20W.%20S.%20Anderson">Paul W. S. Anderson</a> pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, and showed him concept art created by <a href="Randy%20Bowen">Randy Bowen</a>. Impressed with Anderson's idea, Davis thought the story was like "<a href="Jaws%20%28film%29">Jaws</a>" in that it "just drew you in, it drew you in". Anderson started to work on the film after completing the script for "", with <a href="Shane%20Salerno">Shane Salerno</a> (writer of "") co-writing. Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script, finished its development, and stayed on for revisions throughout the film's production. <a href="Dan%20O%27Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Shusett">Ronald Shusett</a> received story credit on the film based on elements from their work on the original "Alien".

Early reports claimed the story was about humans who tried to lure Predators with Alien eggs, although the idea was scrapped. Influenced by the work of <a href="Erich%20von%20D%C3%A4niken">Erich von Däniken</a>, Anderson researched von Däniken's <a href="ancient%20astronaut%20hypothesis">theories</a> on how he believed early civilisations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens, an idea drawn from <a href="Aztec%20mythology">Aztec mythology</a>. Anderson wove these ideas into "Alien vs. Predator", describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a> rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens. To explain how these ancient civilisations "disappeared without a trace", Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators, if overwhelmed by the Aliens, would use their self-destruct weapons to kill everything in the area. <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s novella "<a href="At%20the%20Mountains%20of%20Madness">At the Mountains of Madness</a>" (1931) served as an inspiration for the film, and several elements of the "Aliens vs. Predator" comic series were included. Anderson's initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film, although the number was later reduced to three.

As "Alien vs. Predator" is a sequel to the "Predator" films and prequel to the "Alien" series, Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> island of <a href="Bouvet%20Island">Bouvet</a> commenting, "It's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get." Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the "Alien" series as the protagonist, <a href="Ellen%20Ripley">Ellen Ripley</a>, had no knowledge the creatures existed. "You can't have an Alien running around the city now, because it would've been written up and everyone will know about it. So there's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists."

The first actor to be cast for "Alien vs. Predator" was <a href="Lance%20Henriksen">Lance Henriksen</a>, who played the character Bishop in "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" and "<a href="Alien%203">Alien 3</a>". Although the "Alien" films are set 150 years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire and self-taught-engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the "Alien" films after him; "when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created with the face of the creator. It's kind of like <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> building an android in 100 years time that has the face of <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a>."

Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor <a href="Raoul%20Bova">Raoul Bova</a>, <a href="Ewen%20Bremner">Ewen Bremner</a> from Scotland, and English actor <a href="Colin%20Salmon">Colin Salmon</a>. Producer Davis said, "There's a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character." Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film's heroine Alexa Woods. <a href="Sanaa%20Lathan">Sanaa Lathan</a> was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to "Alien" heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different.

Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan "Dutch" Schaeffer from "<a href="Predator%20%28film%29">Predator</a>" in a short <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> if he lost the <a href="California%20recall%20election%2C%202003">recall election</a> on condition that the filming should take place at his residence. Schwarzenegger, however, won the election with 48.58% of the votes and was unavailable to participate in "Alien vs. Predator". Actress <a href="Sigourney%20Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a>, who starred as Ellen Ripley in the "Alien" series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was "the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place", and thought the concept "sounded awful".

Production began in late 2003 at <a href="Barrandov%20Studios">Barrandov Studios</a> in Prague, <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, where most of the filming took place. <a href="Production%20designer">Production designer</a> Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and <a href="hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> were influenced by <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>n, and <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a> similar to the original "Alien" film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.

Third scale <a href="Miniature%20effect">miniatures</a> several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on <a href="computer%20generated%20imagery">computer generated imagery</a> (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of <a href="artificial%20snow">artificial snow</a> were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: "With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there." A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.

Special effects company <a href="Amalgamated%20Dynamics">Amalgamated Dynamics</a> Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the movie, having previously worked on "Alien 3" and "Alien: Resurrection". Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and <a href="John%20Bruno%20%28special%20effects%20artist%29">John Bruno</a> were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots. ADI founders Alec Gillis, <a href="Tom%20Woodruff%20Jr.">Tom Woodruff Jr.</a> and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the "Predator" films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.

The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims "is what the Predator is all about". A <a href="Hydraulic%20drive%20system">hydraulic</a> Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a "slimline and skeletal" appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.

The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are "there in the frame". Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate, and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry. The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised "Alien" director <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s and "Predator" director <a href="John%20McTiernan">John McTiernan</a>'s abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with "Alien vs. Predator". "Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there until the end of the movie, it's fucking relentless".

Austrian composer <a href="Harald%20Kloser">Harald Kloser</a> was hired to create the <a href="Film%20score">film's score</a>. After completing the score for "<a href="The%20Day%20After%20Tomorrow">The Day After Tomorrow</a>", Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he is a fan of the franchises. It was recorded in London, and was primarily <a href="orchestral">orchestral</a> as Anderson commented, "this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying, classic movie score to go with it; at the same time it's got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support."

The score was released on 31 August 2004, and received mixed reviews. James Christopher Monger of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well, and called "Alien vs. Predator Main Theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in." Mike Brennan of Soundtrack, however, said it "lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy ("Alien") and the "Predator" scores, which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content. Kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues ("Antarctica" and "Down the Tunnel"), but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif." John Fallon of <a href="JoBlo.com">JoBlo.com</a> compared it to <a href="Characterization">character development</a> in the film, "too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression."

"Alien vs. Predator" was released in North America on August 13, 2004 in 3,395 theatres. The film grossed $38.2 million over its opening weekend for an average of $11,278 per theatre, and was number one at the box office. The film spent 16 weeks in cinemas and made $80,281,096 in North America. It grossed $9 million in the United Kingdom, $16 million in Japan, and $8 million in Germany and totalled $92,262,423 at the international box office. This brought the film's worldwide gross to $172,543,519, making it the highest-grossing film in either the "Predator" or "Alien" franchises (excluding "<a href="Prometheus%20%282012%20film%29">Prometheus</a>", which grossed over $403 million worldwide). It ranks second behind "Aliens" at the domestic box office, and fifth behind the first three "Alien" films and the <a href="Predator%20%28film%29">original "Predator" film</a>, when adjusted for inflation.

The film was not screened in advance for critics. "Alien vs. Predator" received negative reviews with praise towards its special-effects and set design, but received criticism for its dialogue, the "fast-paced editing" during fight sequences, lighting, and its <a href="PG-13">PG-13</a> rating. On aggregator website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> the film has a rating of 20%, based on 144 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, "Gore without scares and cardboard cut-out characters make this clash of the monsters a dull sit." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> the film has a score of 29 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.

Rick Kisonak of "<a href="Film%20Threat">Film Threat</a>" praised the film stating, "For a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown, "Alien vs. Predator" is a surprisingly good time". Ian Grey of the "<a href="Orlando%20Weekly">Orlando Weekly</a>" felt, "Anderson clearly relished making this wonderful, utterly silly film; his heart shows in every drip of slime." Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com called it "a pretty movie to look at with its grandiose sets and top notch creature FX, but it's a lot like Anderson's previous works in that it's all facade and no foundation." Gary Dowell of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" called the film, "a transparent attempt to jumpstart two run-down franchises". <a href="Ed%20Halter">Ed Halter</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" described the film's lighting for fight sequences as, "black-on-black-in-blackness", while <a href="Ty%20Burr">Ty Burr</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" felt the lighting "left the audience in the dark".

"Alien vs. Predator" was released on VHS and DVD in North America on 25 January 2005. The DVD contained two <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentaries</a>. The first featured Paul W. S. Anderson, Lance Henriksen, and Sanaa Lathan, while the second included special effects supervisor John Bruno and ADI founders Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff. A 25-minute "Making of" featurette and a Dark Horse "AVP" comic cover gallery were included in the special features along with three deleted scenes from the film. On release, "Alien vs. Predator" debuted at number 1 on the Top DVD Sales and Top Video Rental charts in North America.

A two-disc "Extreme Edition" was released on 7 March 2005, featuring <a href="Making-of">behind the scenes</a> footage of the conception, <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>, production, <a href="post-production">post-production</a>, and licensing of the film. An "Unrated Edition" was released on 22 November 2005, containing the same special features as the Extreme Edition as well as an extra eight minutes of footage in the film. John J. Puccio of DVD Town remarked that the extra footage contained "a few more shots of blood, gore, guts, and slime to spice things up...and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much." The film was released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in North America on 23 January 2007.

A sequel titled "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem" was released in December 2007.

U.S. Route 113

U.S. Route 113 (US 113) is a <a href="spur%20route">spur</a> of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2013">US 13</a> in the U.S. states of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">U.S. Highway</a> runs from US 13 in <a href="Pocomoke%20City%2C%20Maryland">Pocomoke City, Maryland</a> north to <a href="Delaware%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BRoute%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1">Delaware Route 1</a> (DE 1) in <a href="Milford%2C%20Delaware">Milford, Delaware</a>. In conjunction with DE 1, US 113 is one of two major north–south highways on the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> (with US 13) that connect <a href="Dover%2C%20Delaware">Dover</a> with Pocomoke City and the <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Virginia">Eastern Shore of Virginia</a>. The U.S. Highway is the primary north–south highway in <a href="Worcester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Worcester County, Maryland</a>, where it connects Pocomoke City with <a href="Snow%20Hill%2C%20Maryland">Snow Hill</a> and <a href="Berlin%2C%20Maryland">Berlin</a>. US 113 is one of three major north–south highways in <a href="Sussex%20County%2C%20Delaware">Sussex County, Delaware</a>, where it connects <a href="Selbyville%2C%20Delaware">Selbyville</a> and <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Delaware">Georgetown</a> with Milford. While US 113 does not pass through <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City</a> or the <a href="Delaware%20Beaches">Delaware Beaches</a>, the U.S. Highway intersects several highways that serve the <a href="Atlantic%20seaboard">Atlantic seaboard</a> resorts, including <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Maryland">US 50</a>, <a href="Maryland%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BRoute%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B90">Maryland Route 90</a> (MD 90), <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20Delaware">US 9</a>, and DE 1. US 113 is a four-lane <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> for its whole length except for between Snow Hill and Berlin, where it is a two-lane undivided road.

US 113 follows the corridor of a <a href="post%20road">post road</a> established in the late 18th century to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington</a> and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s. In Maryland, the post road was designated one of the original state roads established by the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">Maryland State Roads Commission</a> (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville–Dover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of <a href="T.%20Coleman%20du%20Pont">Thomas Coleman DuPont</a>. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the <a href="Delaware%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Delaware State Highway Department</a> (DSHD), spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US 113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. <a href="Bypass%20%28road%29">Bypasses</a> of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became <a href="%23Former%20Delaware%20alternate%20route">US 113 Alternate</a>.

Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway began in the 1950s in Dover. Much of the remainder of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US 113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US 113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US 113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become <a href="%23Snow%20Hill%20business%20route">US 113 Business</a>. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000. The <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">Maryland State Highway Administration</a> (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US 113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE 1 from Milford to Dover. The <a href="Delaware%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Delaware Department of Transportation</a> (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US 113 to a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> from Selbyville to <a href="Ellendale%2C%20Delaware">Ellendale</a>; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.

US 113 serves as an important route carrying local and through traffic along with tourist traffic bound for the <a href="Delaware%20Beaches">Delaware Beaches</a> and <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a> to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism to the beach areas is at its highest. Access from US 113 to the beach areas is provided by <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20Delaware">US 9</a> and <a href="Delaware%20Route%20404">DE 404</a> toward <a href="Lewes%2C%20Delaware">Lewes</a>, <a href="Rehoboth%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Rehoboth Beach</a>, and <a href="Dewey%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Dewey Beach</a>; <a href="Delaware%20Route%2026">DE 26</a> toward <a href="Bethany%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Bethany Beach</a>; <a href="Delaware%20Route%2054">DE 54</a> toward <a href="Fenwick%20Island%2C%20Delaware">Fenwick Island</a>; <a href="Maryland%20Route%2090">MD 90</a> toward northern Ocean City; <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Maryland">US 50</a> toward downtown Ocean City; and <a href="Maryland%20Route%20376">MD 376</a> toward <a href="Assateague%20Island">Assateague Island</a>. US 113 also serves as a part of a primary <a href="hurricane%20evacuation%20route">hurricane evacuation route</a> from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. In 2016, US 113 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> count ranging from a high of 38,505 vehicles at the US 9 intersection in Georgetown to a low of 6,070 vehicles between the southern terminus of US 113 Business and MD 12 in Snow Hill. All of US 113 is part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>.

US 113 has a length of in Maryland, where the route is named Worcester Highway. The highway extends the length of Worcester County and serves three of the county's four towns: Pocomoke City, Snow Hill, and Berlin. US 50 connects US 113 with the county's fourth town, Ocean City. Between Snow Hill and Berlin, the U.S. Highway is part of the <a href="Cape%20to%20Cape%20Scenic%20Byway">Cape to Cape Scenic Byway</a>, a <a href="Maryland%20Scenic%20Byway">Maryland Scenic Byway</a> that comprises several highways in Worcester County.

US 113 begins at the city limit of Pocomoke City at an intersection with US 13 (<a href="Ocean%20Highway">Ocean Highway</a>), the main highway of the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> that connects Wilmington and Dover with <a href="Salisbury%2C%20Maryland">Salisbury</a> and <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>. Old Virginia Road (unsigned <a href="Maryland%20Route%20250">MD 250A</a>) continues west to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2013%20Business%20%28Pocomoke%20City%2C%20Maryland%29">US 13 Business</a> (Market Street). US 13 Business heads north through the <a href="Pocomoke%20City%20Historic%20District">Pocomoke City Historic District</a>, which preserves buildings from Pocomoke City's late 19th century and early 20th century heyday as a river port and station on the <a href="New%20York%2C%20Philadelphia%20and%20Norfolk%20Railroad">main rail line</a> of the Delmarva Peninsula.

US 113 heads northeast from US 13 as a four-lane divided highway and intersects American Legion Drive (unsigned MD 359B), which leads to <a href="Maryland%20Route%20359">MD 359</a> (Bypass Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Town Branch, a tributary of the <a href="Pocomoke%20River">Pocomoke River</a>, and leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting <a href="Maryland%20Route%20756">MD 756</a> (Old Snow Hill Road). US 113 parallels the <a href="%3Awikt%3Aleft%20bank">left bank</a> of the Pocomoke River and crosses many streams that drain into the river, including Pilchard Creek, Bachelors Branch, Mataponi Creek, Corkers Creek, and Hardship Branch. US 113 passes through <a href="Pocomoke%20State%20Forest">Pocomoke State Forest</a>, which preserves <a href="loblolly%20pine">loblolly pine</a> stands and <a href="bald%20cypress">bald cypress</a> swamps along the Maryland Scenic River; by the <a href="Pocomoke%20River%20Wildlife%20Management%20Area">Pocomoke River Wildlife Management Area</a>, in which <a href="dove">dove</a> hunting regularly occurs; and by the Shad Landing unit of <a href="Pocomoke%20River%20State%20Park">Pocomoke River State Park</a>, which offers boating, fishing, and a <a href="nature%20center">nature center</a>.
Northeast of the state park entrance, US 113 Business (Market Street) splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of Worcester County and contains several museums and <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">colonial era</a> buildings of the river port at the <a href="%3Awikt%3Ahead%20of%20navigation">head of navigation</a> of the Pocomoke River. US 113 bypasses the town to the south and east and intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2012">MD 12</a> (Snow Hill Road), which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton, and <a href="Maryland%20Route%20365">MD 365</a> (Public Landing Road). The MD 365 junction is a <a href="superstreet">superstreet</a> intersection; MD 365 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along US 113, and turn right again to continue on MD 365. North of MD 365, the highway reduces to a two-lane road and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River. US 113 has a <a href="grade%20crossing">grade crossing</a> with the Snow Hill Line of the <a href="Maryland%20and%20Delaware%20Railroad">Maryland and Delaware Railroad</a> and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US 113 Business.

US 113 continues northeast, crosses Poorhouse Branch of the Pocomoke River, and passes <a href="Worcester%20Technical%20High%20School%20%28Maryland%29">Worcester Technical High School</a>. North of its crossing of Five Mile Branch, the highway veers away from the Pocomoke River and enters the <a href="Atlantic%20seaboard%20watershed">Atlantic seaboard watershed</a>. , the highway enters a construction zone where the route is being expanded to a four-lane divided highway. US 113 parallels the rail line before it intersects the rail line at an oblique <a href="level%20crossing">grade crossing</a> at Newark Road and crosses Marshall Creek, which flows into <a href="Newport%20Bay%20%28Maryland%29">Newport Bay</a>. The highway passes to the south of the village of <a href="Newark%2C%20Maryland">Newark</a>, which contains the <a href="Queponco%20Railway%20Station">Queponco Railway Station</a>, a preserved <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> station. US 113 expands to a four-lane divided highway at the north end of the construction zone between Langmaid Road and Massey Branch. The highway crosses Porter Creek and Goody Hill Branch of Bassett Creek and passes through Ironshire, which contains the <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federal-style</a> plantation home <a href="Simpson%27s%20Grove">Simpson's Grove</a>.

US 113 crosses Poplartown Branch of Beaverdam Creek, passes the historic <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate-style</a> plantation home <a href="Merry%20Sherwood">Merry Sherwood</a>, and enters the town of Berlin at its southern junction with <a href="Maryland%20Route%20818">MD 818</a> (Main Street). MD 818 heads north through the <a href="Berlin%20Commercial%20District">Berlin Commercial District</a>, which contains several museums and preserves buildings from the late 19th century when Berlin was at the intersection of two railroad lines. East of the town center, US 113 crosses Hudson Branch of Trappe Creek and intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20376">MD 376</a> (Bay Street) and <a href="Maryland%20Route%20346">MD 346</a> (Old Ocean City Boulevard). The U.S. Highway passes west of <a href="Atlantic%20General%20Hospital">Atlantic General Hospital</a> as it leaves the town of Berlin just south of its <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> with US 50 (Ocean Gateway), which connects Ocean City with Salisbury and the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay%20Bridge">Chesapeake Bay Bridge</a>. North of the interchange, within which the highways cross Kitts Branch, US 113 meets the northern end of MD 818 as it begins to closely parallel the Snow Hill Line.

US 113 closely parallels the railroad west of <a href="Friendship%2C%20Worcester%20County%2C%20Maryland">Friendship</a> to north of its <a href="right-in/right-out">right-in/right-out</a> junction with <a href="Maryland%20Route%20575">MD 575</a> (Worcester Highway), an interchange only accessible to the northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">partial cloverleaf interchange</a>; MD 90 connects the northern part of Ocean City with US 50 west of Berlin. US 113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD 575 and <a href="Maryland%20Route%20589">MD 589</a> (Racetrack Road), which leads to <a href="Ocean%20Pines%2C%20Maryland">Ocean Pines</a> and <a href="Ocean%20Downs">Ocean Downs</a>, a <a href="harness%20racing">harness racing</a> track with a <a href="List%20of%20casinos%20in%20Maryland">slot machine casino</a>. The exit ramp from northbound US 113 intersects MD 575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Showell%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Martin's Episcopal Church</a>.

US 113 continues through <a href="Showell%2C%20Maryland">Showell</a>, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form Shingle Landing Prong of the <a href="St.%20Martin%20River">St. Martin River</a>, which empties into <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight%20Bay">Isle of Wight Bay</a>, a lagoon on the west side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via Shingle Landing Road. US 113 intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20367">MD 367</a> (Bishopville Road) at <a href="Bishop%2C%20Maryland">Bishop</a> and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of <a href="Maryland%20Route%20610">MD 610</a> (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville Prong of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the <a href="Transpeninsular%20Line">Transpeninsular Line</a>, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century <a href="Penn%E2%80%93Calvert%20boundary%20dispute">Penn–Calvert boundary dispute</a>.

US 113 has a length of in Delaware, where the route is named DuPont Boulevard. The highway extends the length of Sussex County and into far southern Kent County. US 113 runs from Selbyville at the Maryland state line to Milford, a city that lies in both Sussex and Kent counties. Between those municipalities, US 113 serves the towns of Frankford, Dagsboro, Millsboro, Georgetown, and Ellendale. The U.S. Highway intersects several east–west highways that connect US 113 with the Delaware beach towns to the east, including Lewes, Reboboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, and Fenwick Island. The following includes a description of US 113's former course from Milford to Dover, almost all of which is now solely DE 1.

US 113 enters Sussex County to the east of the <a href="Great%20Cypress%20Swamp">Great Cypress Swamp</a> in the town of Selbyville, which was a center of <a href="strawberry">strawberry</a> production from the 19th century to the 1930s. The highway crosses Sandy Branch and intersects <a href="Route%2054%20%28Delaware%E2%80%93Maryland%29">DE 54</a> (Cemetery Road/Cypress Road), which heads east to <a href="Fenwick%20Island%2C%20Delaware">Fenwick Island</a>. The U.S. Highway heads north parallel to the Maryland and Delaware Railroad to the town of Frankford, which was founded around a country store and the site of the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> <a href="Capt.%20Ebe%20Chandler%20House">home of Captain Ebe Chandler</a>. The highway crosses Vines Creek, the southernmost of several <a href="Indian%20River%20%28Delaware%29">Indian River</a> tributaries the route crosses, and passes along the western edge of the town. US 113 continues northwest parallel to the rail line, which north of Frankford is operated by the <a href="Delmarva%20Central%20Railroad">Delmarva Central Railroad</a> as the Indian River Subdivision line.

US 113 next comes to the town of Dagsboro, which is named for <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> and <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> general and major Sussex County landowner <a href="John%20Dagworthy">John Dagworthy</a>. The highway crosses <a href="Pepper%20Creek%20%28Delaware%29">Pepper Creek</a> and intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2026">DE 26</a> (Clayton Street/Nine Foot Road), which heads east to <a href="Bethany%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Bethany Beach</a>, while it passes through the western fringe of the town. North of Dagsboro, US 113 intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2020">DE 20</a> (Dagsboro Road); the U.S. Highway and state highway <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> through the town of Millsboro, which was named for the cluster of mills around the head of navigation of the Indian River. The highways intersect <a href="Delaware%20Route%2024">DE 24</a> and <a href="Delaware%20Route%2030">DE 30</a> (Washington Street/Laurel Road) west of the town center. After crossing Betts Pond, DE 20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US 113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of <a href="Stockley%2C%20Delaware">Stockley</a>. North of Stockley, US 113 intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2024%20Alternate">DE 24 Alternate</a> (Speedway Road) adjacent to <a href="Georgetown%20Speedway">Georgetown Speedway</a> and passes west of the <a href="Sussex%20Correctional%20Institution">Sussex Correctional Institution</a>.

US 113 enters the town of Georgetown, which was founded as a more central county seat for Sussex County in 1791, at its junction with Bedford Street, which is marked <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20Truck%20%28Georgetown%2C%20Delaware%29">US 9 Truck</a> and <a href="Delaware%20Route%20404%20Truck">DE 404 Truck</a>. The truck routes, which bypass the <a href="Sussex%20County%20Courthouse%20and%20the%20Circle">downtown area of Georgetown</a>, join US 113 to return to their respective mainline highways on the west side of downtown. US 9 Truck ends at the intersection with <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20Delaware">US 9</a> (County Seat Highway/Market Street) on the west side of Georgetown. Along with <a href="Delaware%20Route%20404">DE 404</a>, US 9 heads east toward <a href="Delaware%20Coastal%20Airport">Delaware Coastal Airport</a>, the original county seat of <a href="Lewes%2C%20Delaware">Lewes</a>, the <a href="Cape%20May%E2%80%93Lewes%20Ferry">Cape May–Lewes Ferry</a>, <a href="Rehoboth%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Rehoboth Beach</a>, and <a href="Dewey%20Beach%2C%20Delaware">Dewey Beach</a>. North of the center of town, US 113 intersects DE 404 and <a href="Delaware%20Route%2018">DE 18</a> (Seashore Highway), which head west toward <a href="Bridgeville%2C%20Delaware">Bridgeville</a> and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The U.S. Highway meets the other end of Bedford Street at the north town limit of Georgetown, where it passes east of a <a href="park%20and%20pool">park and pool</a> lot located at a church.

US 113 continues northwest through <a href="Redden%20State%20Forest">Redden State Forest</a>, whose loblolly pines occupy several disjoint tracts between Georgetown and Ellendale. The state forest originated as a <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> hunting preserve in the early 20th century, and the hunting lodge, forester's house, and stable is preserved and today used as the <a href="Redden%20Forest%20Education%20Center">Redden Forest Education Center</a> east of the hamlet of <a href="Redden%2C%20Delaware">Redden</a>. In this community, the road has an intersection with Redden Road. The U.S. Highway also passes near <a href="McColley%27s%20Chapel">McColley's Chapel</a> and crosses Gravelly Branch, one of the headwaters of the <a href="Nanticoke%20River">Nanticoke River</a>, north of Redden. US 113 curves north and passes by the <a href="Ellendale%20State%20Forest%20Picnic%20Facility">Ellendale State Forest Picnic Facility</a>, a picnic area accessible from the northbound direction that the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> constructed in the late 1930s for tourists and long-distance travelers. West of the town of Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines, the highway intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2016">DE 16</a> (Beach Highway/Milton Ellendale Highway) and passes <a href="Teddy%27s%20Tavern">Teddy's Tavern</a>, which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to serve travelers on the DuPont Highway.

North of Ellendale, US 113 enters the <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a> watershed; the highway crosses Cedar Creek and passes to the west of the <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated village</a> of <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Delaware">Lincoln</a>. The highway continues through the city of Milford, which was founded in the early 19th century at the head of navigation of the <a href="Mispillion%20River">Mispillion River</a> whose <a href="%3Awikt%3Aantebellum">antebellum</a> buildings, late 19th-century buildings, and shipbuilding heritage are preserved, respectively, in the <a href="North%20Milford%20Historic%20District">North Milford</a>, <a href="South%20Milford%20Historic%20District">South Milford</a> and <a href="Milford%20Shipyard%20Area%20Historic%20District">Milford Shipyard Area</a> historic districts. US 113 intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2036">DE 36</a> (Lakeview Avenue) on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments, <a href="Silver%20Lake%20%28Milford%2C%20Delaware%29">Silver Lake</a> to the east and <a href="Haven%20Lake">Haven Lake</a> to the west. The highway has a grade crossing of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision track and intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%2014">DE 14</a> (Front Street/Milford Harrington Highway). On the north side of Milford, US 113 passes the historic <a href="Walnut%20Farm">Walnut Farm</a> and heads east of a park and pool lot at a local business before it intersects <a href="Delaware%20Route%201%20Business">DE 1 Business</a> (Walnut Street) obliquely. DE 1 Business joins US 113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern termini at a partial interchange with DE 1. There is no direct access from northbound US 113 to southbound DE 1 or from northbound DE 1 to southbound US 113.

Until 2003, US 113 continued north from Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. The U.S. Highway crossed the <a href="Murderkill%20River">Murderkill River</a> while passing to the east of the town of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of <a href="Delaware%20Route%2012">DE 12</a> (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic <a href="Barratt%27s%20Chapel">Barratt's Chapel</a>, the birthplace of <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the <a href="St.%20Jones%20River">St. Jones River</a> and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of <a href="Dover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dover Air Force Base</a>. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of <a href="Delaware%20Route%2010">DE 10</a> (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the <a href="Puncheon%20Run%20Connector">Puncheon Run Connector</a> freeway, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 on the south side of Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the <a href="Blue%20Hen%20Corporate%20Center">Blue Hen Corporate Center</a>, which was transformed into a <a href="corporate%20center">corporate center</a> from the <a href="dead%20mall">defunct</a> Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the <a href="Dover%20Green%20Historic%20District">Dover Green Historic District</a> and by the <a href="Delaware%20State%20Capitol">Delaware State Capitol</a>, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).

The original highway along much of the US 113 corridor was a <a href="post%20road">post road</a> established in the late 18th century that connected <a href="Horntown%2C%20Virginia">Horn Town</a> on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia. The Dover–Milford portion of the post road followed the King's Highway established in the late 17th century to connect Dover with Lewes, the original county seat of Sussex County. South of Milford, the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s. A 1796 act of the <a href="Delaware%20General%20Assembly">Delaware General Assembly</a> called for surveying a straighter clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, a highway that became known as the State Road by the mid-19th century. In Maryland, the post road followed what is now MD 12 from the Virginia state line through <a href="Stockton%2C%20Maryland">Stockton</a> to Snow Hill and the Old Stage Road from north of Showell to the Delaware state line, and a separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill. By 1898, the dirt road from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County.

With few exceptions, these roads remained rudimentary and were impassible in bad weather and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The <a href="Good%20Roads%20Movement">Good Roads Movement</a> in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware's leading families that brought good roads to much of the state.

The Maryland Geological Survey was formed in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency determined that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, also known as the Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of <a href="macadam">macadam</a> roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US 113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US 113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.

However, as in the remainder of the state, the State Aid Road Law was insufficient to form a statewide or even countywide network of all-weather roads, so in 1908 the General Assembly passed the State Road Law, which established the Maryland SRC to take over the state-aid support of the Maryland Geological Survey's Highway Division and construct, using state or state-contracted forces, a statewide system of roads to connect <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> and the state's county seats to each other. The system proposed in 1909 included the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill and Snow Hill–Berlin roads. Due to a lack of satisfactory contractor bids, the Maryland SRC contracted Worcester County forces to construct the state road between Snow Hill and Berlin. The county began constructing a macadam road between the ends of the state-aid sections in 1910. The section from Snow Hill to Newark was completed in 1911, and the remainder to Berlin was completed the following year.

Construction on the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill road was started from the Pocomoke City end in 1911. The first three sections were completed as macadam roads from Pocomoke City east to Outens Entrance in 1911, from Snow Hill west to Hardship Branch in 1912, and from Outens Entrance to Betheden Church in 1914. The final section, from Betheden Church to Hardship Branch, was constructed as a <a href="Portland%20cement%20concrete">concrete</a> road. The highway from the state-aid section on the north side of Berlin to Showell was constructed as a concrete road in 1917 and 1918. A concrete road was built north from Showell along a new alignment to tie in with the southern end of the DuPont Highway at Selbyville in 1921. By 1923, the town of Snow Hill resurfaced its Main Street and turned it over to the Maryland SRC, and Berlin gave its concrete Main Street to the state for maintenance, completing the highway from Pocomoke City to the Delaware state line.

The Delaware General Assembly approved a state-aid road law in 1903, but the law was repealed in 1905. Instead, the driving force for the construction of what became the Delaware portion of US 113 was <a href="T.%20Coleman%20du%20Pont">Thomas Coleman DuPont</a>, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure. Inspired by the great <a href="Boulevard%23Europe">boulevards of Europe</a> and cognizant of the need for a main north–south highway as the backbone of a well-laid-out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> that contained a high-speed automobile highway flanked by dual <a href="tram">trolley</a> tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at the outer edge of the right-of-way. The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and utility line rentals. After sections of the highway were built, they would be turned over without charge to the state, which would maintain the road.

Despite these grand visions, in the end the DuPont Highway was constructed in Sussex County as a wide concrete roadway on the proposed right-of-way. The Delaware General Assembly passed the Boulevard Corporation Act of 1911, which authorized the formation of Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., to acquire land and construct a highway the length of the state. Construction of the first section of the highway began near Selbyville on September 18, 1911. By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of-way. DuPont offered to make concessions, such as agreeing to pay up to five times the assessed value of a farmer's land five years after the road's completion and reducing the width of the corridor of land to be acquired to . Construction on the highway resumed in 1915 after the litigation had taken its course. The first two sections of the highway, from Selbyville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to the Appenzellar farm south of Milford, were completed on May 24, 1917.

The Delaware General Assembly created the DSHD in 1917 to lay out, construct, and maintain highways and to meet organizational requirements to receive federal aid through the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Road%20Act%20of%201916">Federal Aid Road Act of 1916</a>. On July 20, 1918, DuPont reached an agreement with the state of Delaware for the newly formed DSHD to construct the remaining sections of the highway. DuPont would dissolve Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., and finance the remainder of construction up to , which is equivalent to in . The highway department would complete the road to Milford along the lines designed by DuPont's company. DSHD would both design and construct the DuPont Highway north of Milford; the department decided on a right-of-way for future sections of the highway. The portions from north of Ellendale to north of Milford, from <a href="Frederica%2C%20Delaware">Frederica</a> to <a href="Little%20Heaven%2C%20Delaware">Little Heaven</a>, and through <a href="Rising%20Sun-Lebanon%2C%20Delaware">Rising Sun</a> were completed by 1920. All other portions of the DuPont Highway between Ellendale and Dover were under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville–Wilmington highway was completed near <a href="Odessa%2C%20Delaware">Odessa</a>.

Despite DuPont's grand boulevard not coming to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative as one of the earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing Milford–Dover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.

The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the <a href="Northeast%20megalopolis">Northeast megalopolis</a>. Southern Delaware also developed into a major <a href="truck%20farming">truck farming</a> region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and <a href="broiler%20chicken">broiler chicken</a>s directly to consumers in the north. However, the passenger and freight traffic induced by this increased economic integration and the automobile boom of the 1920s meant that these roads in Delaware and Maryland constructed in the 1910s and 1920s, which were built with widths of , were no longer adequate for the traffic they served. In particular, by 1929 the Selbyville–Milford portion of the DuPont Highway was the only through highway in Delaware with a width of less than . The highway's importance was further implied when the Pocomoke City to Dover highway became part of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a>. The Pocomoke City–Dover route was designated Route No. 113 in the preliminary system proposed in November 1925, and that number and course were confirmed in the system AASHO and the Bureau of Public Roads approved in November 1926. The U.S. Highway's original southern terminus was the intersection of Market Street and Sixth Street in Pocomoke City. US 113's northern terminus was the split between the two main north–south highways of southern Delaware at Coopers Corner north of Puncheon Run on the southern edge of Dover.

In Delaware, the DuPont Highway was widened to with the addition of concrete <a href="shoulder%20%28road%29">shoulders</a> from Selbyville to Georgetown in 1930 and from Georgetown to Milford in 1931. In 1931, the highway department identified the need to expand the highway to from Milford to Dover, and this widening was completed in 1933. In 1930, Governors Avenue was reconstructed as a concrete road and extended to become the new route of US 13 through Dover. US 113 was then extended north along State Street to a new terminus at the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of <a href="Silver%20Lake%20%28Dover%2C%20Delaware%29">Silver Lake</a>.

In 1931, DSHD began construction on the first bypass of Dover. Much of the bypass would use Bay Road, the existing highway from modern <a href="Delaware%20Route%208">DE 8</a> (North Little Creek Road) in Dover to Kitts Hummock on Delaware Bay. The Dover–Kitts Hummock road had been completed as a concrete road in 1926. Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE 1's interchange with <a href="Delaware%20Route%209">DE 9</a> (Bayside Drive) at the southern end of <a href="Dover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dover Air Force Base</a>. The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the <a href="St.%20Jones%20River">St. Jones River</a> at a site called Barkers Landing.

Between December 1931 and the end of 1933, DSHD constructed a <a href="causeway">causeway</a> across of the marsh on the east bank of the river, a process that required multiple applications of <a href="fill%20dirt">fill dirt</a> and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway. A <a href="bascule%20bridge">Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge</a> with a clear opening was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1933 and 1934. Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with concrete pavement starting in 1934. The new highway was constructed with provisions for later being expanded to a divided highway. US 113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass, which was also known as the Eastern Boulevard, north to US 13 (State Street) when the new highway opened by the last weekend of May 1935. DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US 113 Alternate.

The first improvements to US 113 in Maryland were the widening of of the Snow Hill–Berlin road with the addition of a pair of macadam shoulders in 1926. By the end of 1930, the widening of the Snow Hill–Berlin road to was completed. State forces widened the Berlin–Delaware state line road to around 1930; this work included a curve modification at the railroad crossing north of Berlin. Widening of the Pocomoke City–Snow Hill road began in 1929. The first bypass along the route in Maryland was constructed to relieve congestion in Pocomoke City. The <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a>, a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> federal program, partially funded the construction of a concrete road along what is now MD 250A and MD 359 in 1935 and 1936. The original route of US 113 was redesignated MD 756 by 1946.

As early as 1933, two years before US 13 had been completed as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or <a href="Delmar%2C%20Delaware">Delmar</a> (US 13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred due to lack of funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as <a href="asphalt%20concrete">asphalt concrete</a> or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.
The first highway to be so treated was US 113 from Frederica to Little Heaven, which was resurfaced and widened to in 1941. DSHD included the highways between Dover and Milford and between Milford and Selbyville among those that should be reconstructed and resurfaced in the following four years, but that work was postponed due to the near-total cessation of highway construction projects during United States involvement in World War II. DSHD was able to resume this mode of highway reconstruction, which also included widening bridges and culverts, in 1944. This reconstruction plan returned to US 113 in 1946, when the highway between Ellendale and Georgetown was placed under reconstruction. The sections from Selbyville to Dagsboro, from Dagsboro to Georgetown, and from Milford to Little Heaven were expanded beginning in 1947. The post-war reconstruction and widening of US 113 to from Selbyville to the Dover Bypass in Little Heaven was completed with work on the U.S. Highway's Ellendale–Milford segment in 1949.

In 1934, MDSRC had recommended widening the entirety of US 113 from to . Aside from the Pocomoke City Bypass, widening and reconstruction of the U.S. Highway in that state did not occur until after World War II. US 113 was widened and resurfaced from the north end of Berlin to the Delaware state line in 1947 and 1948 and from Pocomoke City to south of Snow Hill in 1948. The highway through Berlin was resurfaced in 1949. The U.S. route from the north end of Snow Hill to Newark was widened and resurfaced in 1951 and 1952. State forces reconstructed or widened seven bridges along the aforementioned widened sections in 1952 and 1953. US 113 through Snow Hill was reconstructed and widened in 1953 and 1954. The final two pieces of US 113 to be reconstructed were through Newark and Ironshire to the southern end of Berlin between 1954 and 1956. Instead of widening the existing highway, the U.S. Highway was built on mostly new alignment, with the northern segment through Ironshire constructed as the first carriageway of a future divided highway. The County Commissioners of Worcester County agreed to accept for maintenance the bypassed highways, Newark Road and Shire Drive, from Maryland SRC in March 1957.

In 1940, DSHD initiated traffic surveys and studies to inform plans to construct a four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US 13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US 113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US 13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US 113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the Dover–Delmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US 13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, only a small portion of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.

The first section of US 113 to be expanded to a divided highway was part of the new US 13 bypass of Dover. The latter highway's new four-lane course, which included a new bridge across the St. Jones River, was constructed starting in 1950 and opened to traffic April 16, 1952. As part of the project, the portion of US 113 from State Street north of Silver Lake to the new US 13 highway was expanded to a divided highway, and both U.S. Highways were marked on the expanded highway from State Street to their split at the modern intersection of US 13 and Bay Road. DSHD may have removed US 113 markers from north of Bay Road as early as 1965, and the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) approved the northern terminus of the U.S. Highway being retracted from the north end of State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road at their spring 1974 meeting. In conjunction, AASHTO approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus.

The first divided highway project on US 113 proper began in 1957. The U.S. Highway's second carriageway was completed from its junction with US 13 and South Little Creek Road to the southern end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959. The first segment of the original DuPont Highway south of Dover to be expanded to a divided highway was from Walnut Street at the north end of Milford to south of Frederica; the southbound roadway of the divided highway section was constructed between 1957 and 1959. The US 113 divided highway was extended around Milford when the southbound carriageway was built from Walnut Street south to near Lincoln between 1961 and 1963; the project included a pair of bridges over the east end of Haven Lake at the Kent–Sussex county line. The Frederica bypass was constructed as a four-lane divided highway between 1963 and 1965. US 113 was expanded to a divided highway from just north of the Maryland state line in Selbyville to DE 20 north of Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967. The highway's second carriageway was built from north of Dagsboro to Stockley between 1966 and 1968. US 113 was completed as a divided highway from Stockley to Bedford Street on the northern edge of Georgetown in 1969. US 113's partial interchange with the Milford Bypass opened in 1971.

The first divided highway project on US 113 in Maryland was the four-lane divided Berlin bypass, which was constructed between 1955 and 1957. A second carriageway was added to the existing highway from Hayes Landing Road to Main Street south of Berlin and for a short stretch north of Main Street on the north side of Berlin. Main Street through Berlin became MD 818 in 1958. When US 50's bypass of Berlin was built between 1957 and 1959, ramps from westbound US 50 to northbound US 113 and from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 were added. The remaining six ramps of the cloverleaf interchange and US 113's bridges across US 50 were completed in 1975 and 1976.

US 113's southern terminus was moved to its present intersection after US 13's bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1961; the segment of highway between US 13 and MD 675 (now US 13 Business) became an extension of MD 250A. The original Pocomoke City bypass from US 13 to MD 756 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1969, the same year work began to establish a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill. The second, northbound carriageway of the highway was constructed from east of Pilchard Creek to Blades Road between 1969 and 1971 and from Blades Road to the south end of the Snow Hill bypass in 1970 and 1971. US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from its US 13 intersection to east of Pilchard Creek, over which a new bridge was built for the northbound carriageway, starting in 1972. The now-bypassed 1936 Pocomoke City bypass was redesignated MD 359 after the completion of the new bypass in late 1974. The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was built as the southbound carriageway of an eventual divided highway from its south end to MD 12 in 1971 and 1972 and from MD 12 to north of Snow Hill between 1973 and 1975; the latter section included a three-span bridge across Purnell Branch. The bypassed portion of US 113 through Snow Hill became MD 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.

Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway expansion projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required <a href="environmental%20impact%20assessment">environmental impact assessment</a> under the <a href="National%20Environmental%20Policy%20Act">National Environmental Policy Act</a>. This new barrier slowed the completion of the divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.

The Negative Declaration for the expansion of US 113 from the north end of the Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The Frederica–Little Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the environmental effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a <a href="draft%20environmental%20impact%20statement">draft environmental impact statement</a>, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the <a href="U.S.%20Coast%20Guard">U.S. Coast Guard</a> to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> pavement study.

MDSHA conducted its first study on expanding US 113 north of Berlin to a divided highway in the early 1970s. Although US 113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right of way along the proposed route. When MD 90 was built from US 50 to east of US 113 between 1973 and 1976, its interchange with the future course of US 113 was partially constructed. MDSHA conducted a second planning study in the late 1980s; in 1990, the agency decided to implement intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway. One particular improvement was reconstructing the highway immediately to the south of the Delaware state line to better tie into the divided highway in Delaware in 1989 and 1990.

After the second study resulted in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US 113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US 113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US 113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US 113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.

US 113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998. The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MD 818 to south of MD 589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD 90 interchange 24 years after it was partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US 113 reconstruction, from south of MD 589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD 589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US 113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD 575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the <a href="Maryland%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Maryland Department of Transportation</a> for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the time needed to complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.

US 113's role between Milford and Dover became secondary with the designation and extension of DE 1 throughout the state in conjunction with the proposed US 13 Relief Route, which is now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway from Dover Air Force Base to Christiana. DE 1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE 1 was co-signed with DE 14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE 14 was truncated at Milford. The DE 1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US 113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US 13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation measures on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to <a href="Nassau%2C%20Delaware">Nassau</a> to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway.

The southernmost part of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, from south of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under construction in 1990 and opened along with the Dover–Smyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due to the need to coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new Main Gate, and reconstruct base housing on the west side of the highway. The Main Gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the Main Gate and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000.

The final piece of the Relief Route associated with US 113 was the <a href="Puncheon%20Run%20Connector">Puncheon Run Connector</a>, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover in favor of the sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the Milford–Dover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US 113 at US 13 in Dover.

Following the expansion of US 113 from Berlin to the Delaware state line, MDSHA turned its attention toward the remaining of two-lane highway in Maryland between the southern end of the Snow Hill Bypass and the southern end of the existing divided highway at Hayes Landing Road south of Berlin. In 2005, MDSHA began construction on a five-phase, long-term project to expand US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway to improve safety and service in the face of increasing seasonal traffic and development. Phase 1, which covered of the Snow Hill bypass from the southern terminus of US 113 Business to just north of MD 365, was completed in 2007. In 2015, MDSHA replaced the standard intersection between US 113 and MD 365 with a superstreet intersection.

Phase 2 was divided into two sub-phases. Phase 2A, which covered the of US 113 from Goody Hill Road south of Ironshire to Hayes Landing Road, occurred from 2007 to 2009. Phase 2B, which covered the of highway between Massey Branch just north of Newark and Goody Hill Road, began in 2009 and was complete at the end of 2011. The service roads constructed during both parts of Phase 2 to restore access to properties cut off by the state establishing <a href="controlled-access%20highway">partial control of access</a> on US 113 were designated segments of <a href="Maryland%20Route%20921">MD 921</a>. Construction on Phase 3, which involves the of roadway between Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill and Massey Branch, began in fall 2015 and is expected to be finished in spring 2017. Phase 4 includes the section of US 113 between the northern end of Phase 1 near MD 365 north to the southern end of Phase 3 at Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill. Phase 4, which is expected to be constructed between 2017 and 2019, will complete US 113 as a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Milford.

Maryland and Delaware plan to continue to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project for the construction of an interchange between US 113 and MD 12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a <a href="dumbbell%20interchange">dumbbell interchange</a>, a variation on the <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> with <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a>s replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and the south end of the Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.

In 2001, the DelDOT conducted a feasibility study for a future north–south limited access highway in Sussex County. The "Sussex County North–South Transportation Study" explored routes along and between the US 13, US 113, and DE 1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; and the ability to build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US 113 corridor, using as much of the current US 113 route as possible. For its standing US 113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.

Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown areas have been environmentally cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway to provide access to properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16. The proposed interchange at DE 16 will enter the design phase in 2018, with construction planned to begin in 2024. 

The Federal Highway Administration approved the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street on the southern edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts to reduce the number of contact points. The interchange at DE 18 and DE 404 is currently in the design phase, with construction expected to begin in 2023.

Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford proposals faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was an eastern bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; pass to the east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor <a href="Jack%20Markell">Jack Markell</a> suspended further planning work on US 113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the Millsboro–South area.

In May 2011, Sussex County legislators proposed the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment, with the addition of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US 113 and DE 24 that could be constructed mostly through state-owned land. Despite opposition to its preferred alternative, DelDOT completed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Millsboro–South area in July 2013; the document recognized the significant opposition to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT announced that the Blue Alternative was no longer being considered. Instead, US 113 would be upgraded along its current alignment as part of a Modified Yellow Alternative. However, unlike the original Yellow Alternative, which would upgrade US 113 to a freeway and featured several interchanges, US 113 would not become a freeway under the modified plan. Instead, only some crossroads would be eliminated, US 113 would be expanded to six lanes between its intersections with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-lane northeast bypass of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be built and connect with US 113 at a partial cloverleaf interchange near the northern US 113–DE 20 junction. In December 2016, DelDOT completed a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the agency's preferred alternative.

The Milford area study has been dormant since July 2007 due to community opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes to the west and east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US 113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE 1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE 1 Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75 percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the <a href="Delaware%20General%20Assembly">Delaware General Assembly</a> passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US 113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US 113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.

US 113 has had two <a href="special%20routes">special routes</a>: an existing <a href="business%20route">business route</a> through Snow Hill and a former <a href="alternate%20route">alternate route</a> between Little Heaven and Dover.

U.S. Route 113 Business (US 113 Business) is a <a href="business%20route">business route</a> of US 113 in Maryland. The route follows Market Street for between junctions with US 113 on the south and north sides of Snow Hill. The business route is part of the Cape to Cape Scenic Byway from its southern intersection with MD 12 to US 113 north of Snow Hill. US 113 Business follows the original course of US 113 through Snow Hill. The portions of the highway outside Snow Hill were paved by 1912, and the town portion was resurfaced and became a state highway by 1923. The Snow Hill bypass was completed in 1975, and the bypassed portion of US 113 through the town became Maryland Route 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.

US 113 Business begins at an intersection with US 113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business route heads northeast as two-lane Market Street into the town limits and to the downtown area. US 113 Business passes near the <a href="neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> home <a href="Chanceford">Chanceford</a> and by the <a href="Julia%20A.%20Purnell%20Museum">Julia A. Purnell Museum</a>, which displays the history and memorability of Snow Hill, including the namesake's <a href="needlework">needlework</a>. The route passes the <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian-style</a> <a href="Samuel%20Gunn%20House">Samuel Gunn House</a> and <a href="All%20Hallows%20Episcopal%20Church">All Hallows Episcopal Church</a>, an example of 18th-century church <a href="vernacular%20architecture">vernacular architecture</a>, on either side of its junction with MD 12 (Church Street). MD 12 joins US 113 Business for a short concurrency through downtown Snow Hill, during which the two highways pass the Worcester County Courthouse and <a href="Makemie%20Memorial%20Presbyterian%20Church">Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church</a>, an <a href="Isaac%20Pursell">Isaac Pursell</a>–designed <a href="High%20Victorian%20Gothic">High Victorian Gothic</a> church honoring <a href="Francis%20Makemie">Francis Makemie</a>, the founder of <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a> in the United States. After MD 12 turns north onto Washington Street, the business route passes the <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic Revival</a>–style <a href="George%20Washington%20Purnell%20House">George Washington Purnell House</a> and meets the west end of MD 365 (Bay Street) at the east end of downtown Snow Hill. US 113 Business crosses Purnell Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the town limits of Snow Hill just west of its northern terminus at US 113.

Junction list

U.S. Route 113 Alternate (US 113 Alternate) was an <a href="alternate%20route">alternate route</a> of US 113 that extended from US 113 and DE 1 in Little Heaven north to the intersection of US 13 and US 113 in Dover. US 113 Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US 13 in Dover. The DuPont Highway was paved through Rising Sun by 1920, and the entire length of the Selbyville–Wilmington highway was complete by 1923. When the U.S. Highway System was finalized in 1926, US 113's northern terminus was at Coopers Corner south of Dover, and US 13 followed State Street through the state capital. US 113 was extended north along State Street to the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake after US 13 was placed on a reconstructed Governors Avenue in 1930. After US 113's bypass of Dover was completed in 1935, US 113 Alternate was established along US 113's former course from Little Heaven to Dover and along State Street and joined US 13 to cross Silver Lake to reach US 113's northern terminus at the intersection of DuPont Highway and State Street.

The year after US 113 Alternate was assigned, State Street through Dover was reconstructed and widened and construction began on a new bridge for US 13 and US 113 Alternate across Silver Lake. The hazardous, narrow causeway was replaced with a four-lane, brick-lined, reinforced concrete triple-arch bridge, and State Street between the bridge and the beginning of the US 13 divided highway at US 113's northern terminus was widened to four lanes, in 1937. The intersection of US 113 and US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was reconstructed as a directional intersection in 1956. After US 13's bypass of Dover was completed in 1952, the northern termini of US 113 and US 113 Alternate remained north of Dover until 1974, when AASHTO approved moving the northern terminus of US 113 to the junction of US 13 and Bay Road. The organization also approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus. US 113 Alternate was removed as an alternate route in conjunction with the elimination of US 113 between Milford and Dover after AASHTO approved the moves at the organization's 2003 annual meeting. The portions of US 113 Alternate that were not concurrent with US 13 or DE 10A became unnumbered.

US 113 Alternate began at an intersection with US 113 and DE 1 (Bay Road) in Little Heaven. Connections from southbound US 113 Alternate to northbound US 113 and DE 1 and from southbound US 113 and DE 1 to northbound US 113 Alternate were provided by Mulberrie Point Road. The highway headed northwest as two-lane Clapham Road through the town of <a href="Magnolia%2C%20Delaware">Magnolia</a>, where the highway followed Main Street. There, US 113 Alternate intersected Walnut Street and passed by the late 18th-century <a href="Matthew%20Lowber%20House">Matthew Lowber House</a> and the <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne–style</a> <a href="John%20B.%20Lindale%20House">John B. Lindale House</a>. The highway continued northwest as South State Street to the unincorporated village of <a href="Rising%20Sun%2C%20Delaware">Rising Sun</a>, where the highway veered north and intersected <a href="Delaware%20Route%2010%20Alternate">DE 10 Alternate</a> (Sorghum Mill Road). DE 10 Alternate joined US 113 Alternate in a concurrency north across Tidbury Creek to DE 10 Alternate's eastern terminus at their junction with <a href="Delaware%20Route%2010">DE 10</a> (Lebanon Road) in <a href="Highland%20Acres%2C%20Delaware">Highland Acres</a>.

US 113 Alternate continued north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake and passed through <a href="Kent%20Acres%2C%20Delaware">Kent Acres</a> before it entered the city of Dover just south of its underpass of the <a href="Puncheon%20Run%20Connector">Puncheon Run Connector</a> freeway and crossing of Puncheon Run. Just north of the stream and highway, the alternate route intersected US 13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and the Delaware State Capitol, US 113 Alternate turned east to run concurrently with US 13. The two highways crossed the <a href="St.%20Jones%20River">St. Jones River</a> and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west toward the state capitol and east to provide access to US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US 113 Alternate and US 113 reached their joint termini at US 13's directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alt. and US 113 at the terminal intersection.

Battle of the Bismarck Sea

The Battle of the Bismarck Sea (2–4 March 1943) took place in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA) during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when aircraft of the U.S. <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) attacked a <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="convoy">convoy</a> carrying troops to <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Most of the Japanese task force was destroyed, and Japanese troop losses were heavy.

The Japanese convoy was a result of a Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> decision in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> directly to Lae. The plan was understood to be risky, because Allied <a href="air%20power">air power</a> in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and eight <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a>s with an escort of approximately 100 <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> – set out from <a href="Simpson%20Harbour">Simpson Harbour</a> in Rabaul.

The Allies had detected preparations for the convoy, and naval <a href="codebreakers">codebreakers</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> (<a href="FRUMEL">FRUMEL</a>) and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy’s intended destination and date of arrival. The <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Allied Air Forces</a> had developed new techniques they hoped would improve the chances of successful air attack on ships. They detected and shadowed the convoy, which came under sustained air attack on 2–3 March 1943. Follow-up attacks by <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s and aircraft were made on 4 March. All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk. Of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship, greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea.

Six months after Imperial Japan <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attacked Pearl Harbor</a> in December 1941, the United States won a strategic victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942. Seizing the strategic initiative, the United States and its Allies <a href="Guadalcanal%20campaign">landed on Guadalcanal</a> in the southern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> in August 1942, beginning the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20Campaign">Solomon Islands Campaign</a>. The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943. At the same time, Australian and American forces in New Guinea repulsed the Japanese <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">land offensive along the Kokoda Track</a>. Going on the offensive, the Allied forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">captured Buna–Gona</a>, destroying Japanese forces in that area.

The ultimate goal of the Allied counter-offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons was to capture the main Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, later codified as <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>, and clear the way for the eventual reconquest of the Philippines. Recognising the threat, the Japanese continued to send land, naval, and aerial reinforcements to the area in an attempt to check the Allied advances.

Reviewing the progress of the Battle of Guadalcanal and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> in December 1942, the Japanese faced the prospect that neither could be held. Accordingly, <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> decided to take steps to strengthen the Japanese position in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> by sending <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> Jusei Aoki’s <a href="Japanese%2020th%20Division">20th Division</a> from Korea to <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and Lieutenant General <a href="Heisuke%20Abe">Heisuke Abe</a>’s <a href="Japanese%2041st%20Division">41st Division</a> from China to Rabaul. Lieutenant General <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>, the commander of the <a href="Eighth%20Area%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Eighth Area Army</a> at Rabaul, ordered Lieutenant General <a href="Hataz%C5%8D%20Adachi">Hatazō Adachi</a>’s <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">XVIII Army</a> to secure <a href="Madang">Madang</a>, <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a> and <a href="Tuluvu">Tuluvu</a> in New Guinea. On 29 December, Adachi ordered the <a href="102nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">102nd Infantry Regiment</a> and other units under the command of <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Toru%20Okabe">Toru Okabe</a>, the commander of the infantry group of the <a href="51st%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">51st Division</a>, to move from Rabaul to <a href="Lae">Lae</a> and advance inland to capture <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a>. Following the decision to <a href="Operation%20Ke">evacuate Guadalcanal</a> on 4 January, the Japanese switched priorities from the <a href="Solomon%20Island">Solomon Island</a>s to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and it was decided to send the 20th and 41st Divisions to Wewak.
On 5 January 1943, the convoy, which consisted of five destroyers and five troop transports carrying Okabe’s force, set out for Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) aircraft spotted, shadowed and <a href="Kenneth%20Walker%23Battle%20of%20Wau">attacked the convoy</a>, which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own. An RAAF <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> sank the transport . Although destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, the ship took with it all of Okabe’s medical supplies. Another transport, , was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">North American B-25 Mitchell</a>s that it had to be beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing its troops, but Okabe was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a>.

Most of the 20th Division was landed at Wewak from naval <a href="high%20speed%20transport">high speed transport</a>s on 19 January 1943. The bulk of the 41st Division followed on 12 February. Imamura and <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, the commander of the <a href="8th%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">South East Area Fleet</a>, developed a plan to move the command post of the headquarters of the Japanese XVIII Army and the main body of the <a href="Japanese%2051st%20Division">51st Division</a> from Rabaul to Lae on 3 March, followed by moving the remainder of the 20th Division to Madang on 10 March. This plan was acknowledged to be risky because Allied air power in the area was strong. The XVIII Army staff held <a href="Military%20simulation">war games</a> that predicted losses of four out of ten transports, and between 30 and 40 aircraft. They gave the operation only a 50–50 chance of success. On the other hand, if the troops were landed at Madang, they faced a march of more than over inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads. To augment the three naval and two army fighter <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">groups</a> in the area assigned to protect the convoy, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> temporarily detached 18 fighters from the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> ’s fighter group from <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> to <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a>.

The Allies soon began detecting signs of preparations for a new convoy. A Japanese <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a> of the type normally used for <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area</a> commander – <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a> – ordered an increase in <a href="Aerial%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval <a href="codebreakers">codebreakers</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> (<a href="FRUMEL">FRUMEL</a>) and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted a message from the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Air%20Service">11th Air Fleet</a> to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.

Kenney read this Ultra intelligence in the office of the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">plans to capture and develop the area</a>. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a>, the deputy commander of the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group RAAF</a>, under the command of <a href="Air%20Commodore">Air Commodore</a> <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>.

Kenney informed Whitehead of the proposed convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as to allow for a large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured <a href="Girua%20Airport">airfields around Dobodura</a>, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a>. Kenney flew up to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the <a href="Vitiaz%20Strait">Vitiaz Strait</a>. Kenney returned to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> on 28 February.

In the South West Pacific, a conventional strategic bombing campaign was out of the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was <a href="Air%20interdiction">interdiction</a> of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> <a href="Bill%20Garing">Bill Garing</a>, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.
<a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Paul%20Gunn">Paul I. "Pappy" Gunn</a> and his men at the 81st Depot Repair Squadron in <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville, Queensland</a>, modified some USAAF <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas A-20 Havoc</a> light bombers by installing four <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s in their noses in September 1942. Two fuel tanks were added, giving the aircraft more range. An attempt was then made in December 1942 to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B-25 <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a> to convert it to a "commerce destroyer", but this proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was nose heavy despite added lead ballast in the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft. The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low. The new tactic of having the B-25 strafe ships would be tried in this battle.

The Allied Air Forces also adopted other innovative tactics. In February 1942, the RAAF began experimenting with <a href="skip%20bombing">skip bombing</a>, an anti-shipping technique used by the British and Germans. Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets, bombers would release their bombs which would then, ideally, <a href="ricochet">ricochet</a> across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship, under it, or just over it. A similar technique was mast-height bombing, in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude, , at about , and then drop down to mast height, at about from the target. They would release their bombs at around , aiming directly at the side of the ship. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea would demonstrate that this was the more successful of the two tactics. The two techniques were not mutually exclusive: a bomber could drop two bombs, skipping the first and launching the second at mast height. Practice missions were carried out against the wreck of the , a liner that had run aground in 1923.

The Fifth Air Force had two <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> groups. The <a href="43rd%20Bombardment%20Group">43rd Bombardment Group</a> was equipped with about 55 <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es. Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low. The recently arrived <a href="90th%20Bombardment%20Group">90th Bombardment Group</a> was equipped with <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a>s, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the <a href="38th%20Bombardment%20Group">38th Bombardment Group</a>, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the <a href="22nd%20Bombardment%20Group">22nd Bombardment Group</a>, equipped with <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a>s, but two of the former’s four squadrons had been diverted to the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific Area</a>, and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt.

There was also a light group, the <a href="3rd%20Attack%20Group">3rd Attack Group</a>, equipped with a mixture of Douglas <a href="A-20%20Havoc">A-20 Havoc</a>s and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group’s aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 30 Squadron RAAF</a>, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a>. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the <a href="35th%20Fighter%20Group">35th</a> and <a href="49th%20Fighter%20Group">49th Fighter Group</a>s, both equipped with <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">Bell P-400</a>, <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawk</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20P-38%20Lightning">Lockheed P-38 Lightning</a> fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.

The Japanese convoy – comprising eight <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and eight <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a>s with an escort of approximately 100 <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> – assembled and departed from <a href="Simpson%20Harbour">Simpson Harbour</a> in Rabaul on 28 February. During the January operation, a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain. This had made it easy to provide air cover, but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied Air Forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time. This time, a route was chosen along the north coast, in the hope that the Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy’s objective was Madang. Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would have to fly over New Britain, allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there, but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous, because the convoy would have to negotiate the restricted waters of the Vitiaz Strait. The Japanese named the convoy "Operation 81."
The destroyers carried 958 troops while the transports took 5,954. All the ships were <a href="combat%20loading">combat loaded</a> to expedite unloading at Lae. The commander of the Japanese XVIII Army – Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi – travelled on the destroyer , while that of the 51st Division – Lieutenant General <a href="Hidemitsu%20Nakano">Hidemitsu Nakano</a> – was on board the destroyer . The escort commander – Rear Admiral <a href="Masatomi%20Kimura">Masatomi Kimura</a> of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla – flew his flag from the destroyer . The other five destroyers were , , , and . They escorted seven Army transports: (2,716 <a href="Gross%20register%20tonnage">gross register tons</a>), (950 tons), (5,493 tons), (6,494 tons), (3,793 tons), (2,883 tons) and (6,870 tons). Rounding out the force was the lone Navy transport (8,125 tons). All the ships carried troops, equipment and ammunition, except for the "Kembu Maru", which carried 1,000 drums of <a href="avgas">avgas</a> and 650 drums of other fuel.

The convoy, moving at , was not detected for some time, because of two <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>s that struck the <a href="Solomon%20Sea">Solomon</a> and <a href="Bismarck%20Sea">Bismarck Sea</a>s between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, the crew of a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy. Eight B-17 Flying Fortresses were sent to the location but failed to locate the ships.
At dawn on 2 March, a force of six <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">RAAF A-20 Bostons</a> attacked Lae to reduce its ability to provide support. At about 10:00, another Liberator found the convoy. Eight B-17s took off to attack the ships, followed an hour later by another 20. They found the convoy and attacked with bombs from . They claimed to have sunk up to three merchant ships. "Kyokusei Maru" had sunk carrying 1,200 army troops, and two other transports, "Teiyo Maru" and "Nojima", were damaged. Eight Japanese fighters were destroyed and 13 damaged in the day’s action.

The destroyers "Yukikaze" and "Asagumo" plucked 950 survivors of "Kyokusei Maru" from the water. These two destroyers, being faster than the convoy since its speed was dictated by the slower transports, broke away from the group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s from <a href="No.%2011%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 11 Squadron RAAF</a> took over the task of shadowing the convoy.

By 3 March, the convoy was within range of the air base at <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, and eight <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s from <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron RAAF</a> took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied aircraft took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron RAAF</a> attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.

At 10:00, 13 B-17s reached the convoy and bombed from medium altitude of 7,000 feet, causing the ships to maneuver, which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. The B-17s attracted <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> fighters, which were in turn attacked by the P-38 Lightning escorts. A B-17 broke up in the air, and its crew took to their parachutes. Japanese fighter pilots machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed. Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B-17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three Lightnings, which were also lost. The Allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed, while the B-17 crews claimed five more. Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged. B-25s arrived shortly afterward and released their 500-pound bombs between 3,000 and 6,000 feet, reportedly causing two Japanese vessels to collide. The result of the B-17 and B-25 sorties scored few hits but left the convoy ships separated making them vulnerable to strafers and masthead bombers, and with the Japanese anti-aircraft fire being focused on the medium-altitude bombers this left an opening for minimum altitude attacks.

The 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF approached the convoy at low level to give the impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack. The ships turned to face them, the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers, allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships’ anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews in <a href="strafe">strafing</a> runs with their four nose <a href="autocannon">cannons</a> and six wing-mounted machine guns. On board one of the Beaufighters was cameraman <a href="Damien%20Parer">Damien Parer</a>, who shot dramatic footage of the battle; it was later published in "<a href="The%20Bismarck%20Convoy%20Smashed">The Bismarck Convoy Smashed</a>". Immediately afterward, seven B-25s of the 38th Bombardment Group’s <a href="71st%20Flying%20Training%20Squadron">71st Bombardment Squadron</a> bombed from about , while six from the <a href="405th%20Tactical%20Missile%20Squadron">405th Bombardment Squadron</a> attacked at mast height.

According to the official RAAF release on the Beaufighter attack, "enemy crews were slain beside their guns, deck cargo burst into flame, superstructures toppled and burned". Garrett Middlebrook, a co-pilot in one of the B-25s, described the ferocity of the strafing attacks: 

"Shirayuki" was the first ship to be hit, by a combination of strafing and bombing attacks. Almost all the men on the bridge became casualties, including Kimura, who was wounded. One bomb hit started a <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> explosion that caused the stern to break off, and the ship to sink. Her crew was transferred to "Shikinami", and "Shirayuki" was <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a>. The destroyer "Tokitsukaze" was also hit and fatally damaged. Its crew was taken off by "Yukikaze". The destroyer "Arashio" was hit, and collided with the transport "Nojima", disabling her. Both the destroyer and the transport were abandoned, and "Nojima" was later sunk by an air attack.
Fourteen B-25s returned that afternoon, reportedly claiming 17 hits or near misses. By this time, a third of the transports were sunk or sinking. As the Beaufighters and B-25s had expended their munitions, some USAAF A-20 Havocs of the 3rd Attack Group joined in. Another five hits were claimed by B-17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes. During the afternoon, further attacks from USAAF B-25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed.

All seven of the transports were hit and most were burning or sinking about south east of <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>, along with the destroyers "Shirayuki", "Tokitsukaze" and "Arashio". Four of the destroyers – "Shikinami", "Yukikaze", "Uranami" and "Asagumo" – picked up as many survivors as possible and then retired to Rabaul, accompanied by the destroyer , which had come from Rabaul to assist. That night, a force of ten U.S. Navy <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s – under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Commander</a> Barry Atkins – set out to attack the convoy. Two boats struck submerged debris and were forced to return. The other eight arrived off Lae in the early hours of 4 March. Atkins spotted a fire that turned out to be the transport "Oigawa Maru". "PT-143" and "PT-150" fired torpedoes at it, sinking the crippled vessel. In the morning, a fourth destroyer – "Asashio" – was sunk when a B-17 hit her with a bomb while she was picking up survivors from "Arashio". Only one destroyer, "Yukikaze", was undamaged among the four surviving destroyers.
Some 2,700 survivors were taken to Rabaul by the destroyers. On 4 March, another 1,000 or so survivors were adrift on rafts. On the evenings of 3–5 March, PT boats and planes attacked Japanese rescue vessels, as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service, as well as being retaliation for the Japanese fighter planes attacking survivors of the downed B-17 bomber. While many of the Allied aircrew accepted these attacks as being necessary, others were sickened. On 6 March, the Japanese submarines and picked up 170 survivors. Two days later, "I-26" found another 54 and put them ashore at Lae. Hundreds made their way to various islands. One band of 18 survivors landed on <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a>, where they were captured by "PT-114". Another made its way to Guadalcanal, only to be killed by an American patrol.

On 4 March the Japanese mounted a retaliatory raid on the Buna airfield, the site of a base that the Allies had captured back in January, though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred "after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was a good thing that the <a href="Nip">Nip</a> air commander was stupid. Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd."

On <a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a>, between 8 and 14 March 1943, Australian patrols from the <a href="47th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">47th Infantry Battalion</a> found and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42 and found another nine dead on a raft. One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats, in which were found some documents in sealed tins. On translation by the <a href="Allied%20Translator%20and%20Interpreter%20Section">Allied Translator and Interpreter Section</a>, one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units that had never before been reported. A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.

The battle was a disaster for the Japanese. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. About 2,890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed. The Allies lost 13 aircrew, 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident. There were also eight wounded. Aircraft losses were one B-17 and three P-38s in combat, and one B-25 and one Beaufighter in accidents. MacArthur issued a communiqué on 7 March stating that 22 ships, including twelve transports, three cruisers and seven destroyers, had been sunk along with 12,792 troops. Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. looked into the matter in mid-1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved, but GHQ SWPA considered the original account accurate.

The victory was a propaganda boon for the Allies, with one United States newsreel claiming the Japanese had lost 22 ships, 15,000 troops, and 102 aircraft.

The Allied Air Forces had used 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35 percent, were claimed to have hit, but only 29, or 7.5 percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This compared favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3 percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a> back in January, when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.

There was no doubt that the Japanese had suffered a major defeat. Imamura's chief of staff flew to Imperial General Headquarters to report on the disaster. It was decided that there would be no more attempts to land troops at Lae. The losses incurred in the Bismarck Sea caused grave concern for the security of Lae and Rabaul. This resulted in a change of strategy. On 25 March a joint Army-Navy Central Agreement on South West Area Operations gave operations in New Guinea priority over those in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20campaign">Solomon Islands campaign</a>. The XVIII Army was allocated additional shipping, ordnance and anti-aircraft units, which were sent to Wewak or Hansa Bay. Of the defeat, Rabaul staff officer Masatake Okumiya said, "Our losses for this single battle were fantastic. Not during the entire savage fighting at Guadalcanal did we suffer a single comparable blow. We knew we could no longer run cargo ships or even fast destroyer transports to any front on the north coast of New Guinea, east of Wewak."

The planned movement of the 20th Division to Madang was revised in the light of events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a> further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 was lost in the air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the <a href="Ramu">Ramu</a> and <a href="Markham%20Valley">Markham Valley</a>s. It toiled on the road for the next few months, but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the <a href="Finisterre%20Range">Finisterre Range</a>.

Some submarines were made available for supply runs to Lae, but they did not have the capacity to support the troops there by themselves. An operation was carried out on 29 March in which four destroyers successfully delivered 800 troops to Finschhafen, but the growing threat from Allied aircraft led to the development of routes along the coast of New Guinea from Madang to Finschhafen, and along both the north and south coasts of New Britain to Finschhafen, and thence to Lae using Army <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>. It was by this means that the remainder of the 51st Division finally made the trip to Lae in May. The necessity of delivering troops and supplies to the front in this manner caused immense difficulties for the Japanese in their attempts to halt further Allied advances. After the war, Japanese officers at Rabaul estimated that around 20,000 troops were lost in transit to New Guinea from Rabaul, a significant factor in Japan's ultimate defeat in the New Guinea campaign.

In April, <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> used the additional air resources allocated to Rabaul in <a href="Operation%20I-Go">Operation I-Go</a>, an air offensive designed to redress the situation by destroying Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The operation was indecisive, and Yamamoto himself <a href="Operation%20Vengeance">became a casualty</a> of Allied intelligence and air power in the Solomon Islands on 18 April 1943.

In 1954, O. G. Haywood, Jr., wrote an article in the "" in which <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a> was used to model the decision-making in the battle. Since then, the name of the battle has been applied to this particular type of two-person <a href="zero-sum%20game">zero-sum game</a>.

Damageplan

Damageplan was an American <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> <a href="Supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> from <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, formed in 2003. Following the demise of their previous group <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a>, brothers <a href="Dimebag%20Darrell">Dimebag Darrell</a> and <a href="Vinnie%20Paul">Vinnie Paul Abbott</a> wanted to start a new band. The pair recruited former Diesel Machine and <a href="Halford%20%28band%29">Halford</a> guitarist <a href="Patrick%20Lachman">Pat Lachman</a> on vocals, and later <a href="Bob%20Kakaha">Bob Zilla</a> on bass. Damageplan released their only studio album "<a href="New%20Found%20Power">New Found Power</a>" in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at number 38 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, selling 44,676 copies in its first week.

While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8, 2004 at the <a href="Alrosa%20Villa">Alrosa Villa</a> in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage, killed guitarist Dimebag Darrell and three others, and wounded another seven before being fatally shot by a police officer. Although no motive was found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has been inactive since the incident. Paul and Zilla had joined the band <a href="Hellyeah">Hellyeah</a> (until the former's death in 2018), and Lachman joined the Mercy Clinic.

By 2003, drummer <a href="Vinnie%20Paul">Vinnie Paul</a> and guitarist <a href="Dimebag%20Darrell">Dimebag Darrell</a> were plagued with difficulties that their previous metal band, <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a>, was experiencing. Both described the performance level of Pantera's vocalist, <a href="Phil%20Anselmo">Phil Anselmo</a>, as "hit and miss, depending on what type of chemicals he was on". Following the release of Pantera's 2000 album "<a href="Reinventing%20the%20Steel">Reinventing the Steel</a>" and the subsequent tour, Anselmo and bassist <a href="Rex%20Brown">Rex Brown</a> started to focus on their <a href="side%20project">side project</a>s, and did not discuss or record any further Pantera material, while Darrell and Paul wanted to continue to write and play music. Both Abbott brothers thought it was time to move on, and, upon disbanding Pantera, they began writing new material.

A <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> of the song "Crawl" was sent to former <a href="Halford%20%28band%29">Halford</a> guitarist <a href="Pat%20Lachman">Pat Lachman</a> who auditioned as vocalist. Lachman was hired, and New Found Power was formed in early 2003 with former Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially, who was replaced after the album recording with the brothers' tattoo artist, <a href="Bob%20Zilla">Bob Zilla</a>. When writing music, Paul claimed; "we put no boundaries on it ... we wanted it to be very diverse", and Darrell said "We wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest." The band changed its name to Damageplan and decided to name the first album "New Found Power".

The single "Save Me" debuted on American radio on January 26, 2004, and the band's debut album, "<a href="New%20Found%20Power">New Found Power</a>", was released in the United States on February 10. The album was recorded at the brothers' backyard studio, Chasin' Jason, in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington, Texas</a>, where previous Pantera albums were also recorded. The Abbott brothers found out that during recording, everyone was willing to contribute and "put 100% effort into it" while with Pantera, but they found it too difficult to have Anselmo in the recording studio. <a href="Corey%20Taylor">Corey Taylor</a> of <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a> and <a href="Stone%20Sour">Stone Sour</a>, <a href="Zakk%20Wylde">Zakk Wylde</a> of <a href="Black%20Label%20Society">Black Label Society</a>, and <a href="Jerry%20Cantrell">Jerry Cantrell</a> of <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a> made guest appearances on the tracks "Fuck You", "Soul Bleed", and the bonus track "Ashes to Ashes" respectively, and Sterling Winfield handled co-production duties.

"New Found Power" sold 44,676 copies in its first week to debut at number 38 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The album received mixed reviews from music critics; Christine Klunk of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> commented "I'm not in the least bit interested in where this band goes or what new and exciting ways they'll think of to abuse the listeners," while Johnny Loftus of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> felt it was a "blazing new beginning".

Alice in Chains' vocalist/guitarist <a href="Jerry%20Cantrell">Jerry Cantrell</a> attended a <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> party hosted by the Abbott brothers. Darrell and Paul had a demo of the first song they wrote, titled "Ashes to Ashes". Lachman insisted that it was on the "backburner" until Cantrell showed interest. The band entered the Abbott brothers' backyard studio with Cantrell to record "Ashes to Ashes". Although the song was not completed in time to be featured on "New Found Power", it was included on the Japanese version, and for the soundtrack "". To promote "New Found Power", the band toured with <a href="Hatebreed">Hatebreed</a>, <a href="Drowning%20Pool">Drowning Pool</a>, and <a href="Unearth">Unearth</a> on the second installment of the <a href="Headbangers%20Ball">Headbangers Ball</a>.

On December 8, 2004, the band was on a tour at Alrosa Villa, a <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> nightclub. Moments into the concert, Nathan Gale, a 25-year-old former <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a>, climbed onto the stage, drew his <a href="9%C3%9719mm%20Parabellum">9 mm</a> <a href="Beretta%20M9">Beretta M9</a>, and shot Dimebag Darrell in the head five times, killing him instantly. Head of Security for the band Jeffery "Mayhem" Thompson engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Gale, which allowed Paul and other members to escape. However, Thompson was shot and killed. A fan named Nathan Bray, who attempted to give <a href="CPR">CPR</a> to Thompson and Dimebag Darrell, and Erin Halk, a U.S. Marine-turned-<a href="roadie">roadie</a> who tried to stop Gale while he was reloading, were both shot and killed as well. Once the police arrived, <a href="Columbus%20Division%20of%20Police">Columbus Police</a> officer James Niggemeyer approached the stage from the side, and saw Gale holding his weapon to a hostage. Niggemeyer killed Gale with a single shotgun blast to the head. Fifteen shots were fired by Gale, and an additional 36 rounds were found at his possession.

A police investigation did not find any motive behind the shooting, although Gale's mother stated that he was diagnosed with <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>, and that he believed the Abbott brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity. She was unaware if her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but was proud of his military service following his <a href="Military%20discharge">discharge</a>, and had given him the weapon that was used in the shooting. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a>, was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.

A foundation called The Dimebag Darrell Memorial Fund was founded after the incident, which donated its profits to cover medical expenses of drum technician John Brooks and tour manager Chris Paluska, who were among those injured during the shooting. A public memorial service for Darrell took place on December 14, 2004 at Arlington Convention Center in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington, Texas</a>. Many musicians paid tribute to Darrell on message boards and at live performances.

In May 2005, Niggemeyer was called before a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a>, which was convened by the <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Ohio">Franklin County</a> <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a>'s office to examine the actions taken on the night of Dimebag Darrell's demise, a standard practice when <a href="deadly%20force">deadly force</a> is used. The jury found that there was no wrongdoing on Niggemeyer's part. Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien commented, "There was little doubt [the shooting] was lawful, given the 200 eyewitnesses and the circumstances that surrounded the shooting. Nevertheless, we still have an independent body review the facts". Niggemeyer was nominated for a bravery award on the TV show "<a href="America%27s%20Most%20Wanted">America's Most Wanted</a>".

In a 2005 interview, Damageplan manager Paul Bassman said that unreleased recordings before Darrell's death were near completion. He commented, "Vinnie Paul has said there will be a follow-up album down the road, as Dime would have wanted his music to be heard." Rumors circulated of another album, although nothing has been released.

Following the events since Dimebag Darrell's death, Paul was unsure if he wanted to continue playing music. He was invited to join the band called <a href="Hellyeah">Hellyeah</a>, which included members of <a href="Mudvayne">Mudvayne</a> and <a href="Nothingface">Nothingface</a>, but declined the offer. However, bassist Jerry repeatedly called Paul, and he accepted to join the project as he thought "Everybody had their head in the right place." Hellyeah released its debut album on April 10, 2007. One week later, Zilla joined the band as its new bassist, after left due to "personal reasons". The album was recorded at Abbott's backyard studio, Chasin' Jason, where "New Found Power" was also recorded.

Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided the grieving process. He commented, "you have to get back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the situation I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." Before the shooting, <a href="Phil%20Anselmo">Phil Anselmo</a> made somewhat of a controversial statement by saying "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" in the December 2004 edition of "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>". He denied making the comments and apologized, although Paul requested "Metal Hammer" to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Paul found the quote authentic and referred to him as the "master of lies".

A book titled "A Vulgar Display of Power: Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa" was penned by author <a href="Chris%20Armold">Chris Armold</a>. For 14 months, Armold interviewed people and researched the events leading up to December 8, stating "It's not a book about rock stars, but heroes, regular guys who made the ultimate sacrifice." In his research, Armold found no evidence that the comments Anselmo made before Darrell's death had influenced Gale's actions. The book was released in 2007.

In a 2017 interview with Loudwire, Paul had stated that he had planned to release all unreleased Damageplan recordings at some point in the future, many of which have no vocals. He even stated having some of Dimebag Darrell's favorite musicians, such as <a href="Rob%20Halford">Rob Halford</a> of <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a> to record vocals for the songs.

Paul died on June 22, 2018, at the age of 54.

According to Johnny Loftus of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, Damageplan incorporated elements of <a href="traditional%20heavy%20metal">traditional heavy metal</a>, <a href="post-grunge">post-grunge</a>, <a href="metalcore">metalcore</a>, and <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a>. Damageplan's sound has been described as <a href="groove%20metal">groove metal</a>, <a href="nu%20metal">nu metal</a> and <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a>.

The lyrical process was a collaborative effort consisting of Paul, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over ... So there are a lot of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." This is exemplified in the songs "Reborn", "Wake Up", and "Breathing New Life". "Blunt Force Trauma" is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".

When writing music, the Abbott brothers suggested <a href="guitar%20riff">guitar riff</a>s and "grooves", while Lachman added his input to modify the song's structure. The band's sound has been described by music critics to be similar to Pantera. Christine Klunk of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" disliked the similarities and commented, "aside from a constant, driving rhythm, repetitive riffs, and unintelligible lyrics about (I'm assuming) kicking ass—there's nothing of interest to pay attention to". The song "Breathing New Life" features 180 <a href="beats-per-minute">beats-per-minute</a> <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a> pedaling, what Vik Bansal of <a href="MusicOMH">MusicOMH</a> described as "exploding into a blaze of riffage and a cool chorus". Bansal was impressed with certain elements of the song such as the switch from downbeat singing to "a big chorus lodged in power chord heaven", and the incorporated groove rhythms. However, he felt Dimebag "borrow[ed]" <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>'s guitar solo from the song "Only".

Alexis Bachelot

Alexis Bachelot, <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Hearts%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary">SS.CC.</a>, (born Jean-Augustin Bachelot; February 22, 1796 – December 5, 1837) was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20priest">Roman Catholic priest</a> best known for his tenure as the first <a href="Prefecture%20Apostolic%20of%20the%20Sandwich%20Islands">Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands</a>. In that role, he led the first permanent Catholic <a href="Mission%20%28Christianity%29">mission</a> to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>. Bachelot was raised in France, where he attended the <a href="Irish%20College%20in%20Paris">Irish College in Paris</a>, and was ordained a priest in 1820. He led the first Catholic mission to Hawaii, arriving in 1827. Although he had expected the approval of then Hawaiian King <a href="Kamehameha%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Kamehameha II</a>, he learned upon arrival that Kamehameha II had died and a new government that was hostile towards Catholic missionaries had been installed. Bachelot, however, was able to convert a small group of Hawaiians and quietly minister to them for four years before being deported in 1831 on the orders of <a href="Ka%CA%BBahumanu">Kaʻahumanu</a>, the "<a href="Kuhina%20Nui">Kuhina Nui</a>" (a position similar to <a href="regent">queen regent</a>) of Hawaii.

Bachelot then traveled to <a href="Alta%20California">California</a>, where he served as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Kaʻahumanu's death and King <a href="Kamehameha%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Kamehameha III</a>'s willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bachelot's arrival, Kamehameha III had again changed his mind and Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the <a href="French%20Navy">French</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">British</a> navies imposed a naval <a href="blockade">blockade</a> on the <a href="Honolulu%20Harbor">Honolulu harbor</a>. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>, he died en route and was buried on an islet near <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a>. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the <a href="July%20Monarchy">government of France</a> to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as <a href="Laplace%20Affair">the French Incident</a> and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.

Bachelot was born in <a href="Saint-Cyr-la-Rosi%C3%A8re">Saint-Cyr-la-Rosière</a>, <a href="Orne">Orne</a>, France on February 22, 1796. In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he enrolled in the Preparatory <a href="Seminary">Seminary</a> of <a href="Picpus%2C%20Paris">Picpus</a> to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he <a href="Profession%20%28religious%29">professed</a> at the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Hearts%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary">Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary</a>, taking the name Alexis. He studied at the <a href="Irish%20College%20in%20Paris">Irish College in Paris</a> before being <a href="Holy%20Orders">ordained</a> as a priest in 1820. As a priest, he initially served as the College's <a href="Rector%20%28academia%29">rector</a> and later led the preparatory seminary at <a href="Tours">Tours</a>.

In the early 1820s, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Rives">Jean Baptiste Rives</a>, a French adviser to the Hawaiian king <a href="Kamehameha%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Kamehameha II</a>, traveled to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea, and in 1825, <a href="Pope%20Leo%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BXII">Pope Leo XII</a> assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii. Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.

The expedition was organized by the influential <a href="Monneron%20family">Monneron family</a> and funded by the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">government of France</a>. Bachelot was assisted in his new position by fellow priests <a href="Patrick%20Short">Patrick Short</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Armand">Abraham Armand</a>, as well as several <a href="lay%20brother">lay brother</a>s. The mission sailed from <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> on "La Comète" in November 1826. The missionaries were initially accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities but returned to France after reaching Mexico.

Unbeknownst to Bachelot, political changes occurred in Hawaii prior to the mission's arrival. King died in 1824 and his younger brother became king. Because was young at the time of his ascension, Queen Kaʻahumanu (their stepmother) ruled as "Kuhina Nui". On the advice of <a href="Hiram%20Bingham%20I">Hiram</a>—a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty four years previously—Queen Kaʻahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism. Rives' influence on the Hawaiian government had faded, and he never returned to Hawaii.

"La Comète" arrived in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> on July 7, 1827. The priests were faced with a situation of dire poverty owing to the absence of Rives' patronage. Furthermore, they had promised "La Comète's" captain that Rives would pay for their passage after they arrived in Hawaii, but by the time of their arrival, Rives had already left. Queen Kaʻahumanu refused to allow the missionaries to stay, suspecting them to be covert agents of the government of France. She instructed "La Comète's" captain to take the mission with him when he departed. The captain, however, refused to do so because he did not receive payment for their passage, so the party was able to remain.

The priests began their missionary work, but encountered suspicion from most chiefs. The members of the party had great difficulty defending themselves, as none of them was fluent in English or Hawaiian. But, the group were favorably received by the high chief <a href="Boki%20%28Hawaiian%20chief%29">Boki</a>, the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife <a href="Kuini%20Liliha">Kuini Liliha</a>. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.

For several months, Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures, saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut. They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased, where the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Peace">Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace</a> was dedicated in 1843. After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian language</a>. During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted. They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution. The priests' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.

Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii: "<a href="Prosopis%20humilis">Prosopis humilis</a>" and "<a href="Bougainvillea">Bougainvillea</a>". "Prosopis humilis" trees later covered thousands of acres there. He had obtained the seeds, which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California, from the Royal Conservatory in Paris. Bachelot translated a prayer book into Hawaiian ("O Ke A'o Ana Kristiano", "Christian Doctrine", c. 1831), authored a <a href="catechism">catechism</a> in Hawaiian ("He Ōlelo Ho'ona'auao", "A Word of Instruction", 1831), and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French ("Notes Grammaticales", "Grammatical Notes", 1834).

By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in particular Bingham's teachings, had become the "de facto" state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December 1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the "Waverly", bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.

The news of Bachelot and Short's expulsion caused controversy in the United States, where it was viewed as a violation of the rights appertaining to foreigners in the 1826 treaty signed by Commodore <a href="Thomas%20ap%20Catesby%20Jones">Thomas ap Catesby Jones</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and King . U.S. Navy Commodore <a href="John%20Downes%20%28naval%20officer%29">John Downes</a> protested the expulsions while in discussion with chiefs during his 1832 visit to the kingdom.

The "Waverly" landed at a vacant area near San Pedro, Los Angeles, in January 1832. Bachelot and Short traveled to the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, where they were welcomed by the <a href="Franciscans">Franciscans</a> who staffed the mission. Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles, served as an assistant minister for the mission, and led the mission on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834. He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage. He ministered in California until 1837 and became popular with Angelenos.

In 1833, the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Propagation%20of%20the%20Faith">Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith</a> reorganized the jurisdiction of <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>. Hawaii became part of the newly created <a href="Apostolic%20Vicariate%20of%20Eastern%20Oceania">Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania</a>, which was split into northern and southern divisions. Bachelot remained as the Prefect Apostolic for the northern division. <a href="Etienne%20Jerome%20Rouchouze">Etienne Jerome Rouchouze</a> served as the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and oversaw Bachelot's assignment in Hawaii.

In 1835 and 1836, two representatives of the Catholic Church traveled to Hawaii in an attempt to ascertain whether Bachelot could return. Queen Kaʻahumanu had died in 1832, and the following year King began making radical changes to Hawaiian law. Columban Murphy, a Catholic lay brother from the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, visited King in 1835 and discussed the possibility of Bachelot's return. Finding King amenable to the idea, Murphy traveled to California to relay the news. He was unable, however, to locate Bachelot, who was absent from the area at the time. After Bachelot received Murphy's message, Bachelot and Short decided to return to Hawaii. The <a href="Ayuntamiento">Ayuntamiento</a> in Los Angeles, a municipal council, attempted to dissuade Bachelot and asked the Catholic leadership in <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara</a> to prevent him from leaving, but he insisted on departing and the Catholic leadership did not prevent him.

When Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in May 1837, they spent only 13 days on the island. Notwithstanding the agreement he had signed with <a href="French%20Navy">French Naval</a> Captain <a href="Abel%20Aubert%20Dupetit%20Thouars">Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars</a> that allowed French citizens to live on the island, King sought to deport the priests. Bachelot and Short were confined to the ship on which they had arrived, the "Clémentine", on . However, the "Clémentine"'s captain, Jules Dudoit, refused to transport them from Hawaii. Dudoit, a British citizen of French descent, met with <a href="Richard%20Charlton">Charlton</a>, the British consul, and they publicly protested the priests' confinement. Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful until the British naval vessel HMS "Sulphur" and the French frigate the "La Vénus" arrived in Honolulu on . The ships were commanded respectively by <a href="Edward%20Belcher">Edward Belcher</a> and Dupetit Thouars, who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor, boarded the "Clémentine", and brought Bachelot and Short ashore. The "La Vénus" sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. King agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere, under the condition that they refrain from proselytizing.
That year, Bachelot, who suffered from a form of <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, became very sick. By November 1837, he had recovered sufficiently to leave Hawaii. He purchased a ship and sailed toward Micronesia, intending to work on a mission. Bachelot's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii and he died at sea on December 5, 1837. He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.

Owing to the persecution of Bachelot and his fellow priests, the government of France sent the frigate "L'Artémise" to Hawaii in 1839. Its captain, <a href="Cyrille%20Pierre%20Th%C3%A9odore%20Laplace">Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace</a>, had been instructed to force the government to stop persecuting Catholics. In response to this show of force, King <a href="Edict%20of%20Toleration%20%28Hawaii%29">granted Catholics</a> freedom of religion.
