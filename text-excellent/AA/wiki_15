Asteroid belt

The asteroid belt is the <a href="circumstellar%20disc">circumstellar disc</a> in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> located roughly between the orbits of the <a href="planet">planet</a>s <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s or <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a>s. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as <a href="near-Earth%20asteroids">near-Earth asteroids</a> and <a href="trojan%20asteroids">trojan asteroids</a>. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a>, <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a>, and <a href="10%20Hygiea">Hygiea</a>. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, or 22% that of <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon <a href="Charon%20%28moon%29">Charon</a> (whose diameter is 1200 km).

<a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, the asteroid belt's only <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>, is about 950 km in diameter, whereas <a href="4%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVesta">4 Vesta</a>, <a href="2%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BPallas">2 Pallas</a>, and <a href="10%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHygiea">10 Hygiea</a> have mean diameters of less than 600 km. The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an <a href="asteroid%20family">asteroid family</a> whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their <a href="spectrum">spectra</a>, with most falling into three basic groups: <a href="carbon">carbon</a>aceous (<a href="C-type%20asteroid">C-type</a>), <a href="silicate">silicate</a> (<a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type</a>), and metal-rich (<a href="M-type%20asteroid">M-type</a>).

The asteroid belt formed from the primordial <a href="solar%20nebula">solar nebula</a> as a group of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a>s. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, <a href="gravity">gravitational</a> perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to <a href="accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accrete</a> into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturbed</a> whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a> with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a <a href="Kirkwood%20gap">Kirkwood gap</a> occurs as they are swept into other orbits.

Classes of <a href="Small%20Solar%20System%20body">small Solar System bodies</a> in other regions are the <a href="near-Earth%20objects">near-Earth objects</a>, the <a href="Centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">centaurs</a>, the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> objects, the <a href="scattered%20disc">scattered disc</a> objects, the <a href="sednoid">sednoid</a>s, and the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a> objects.

On 22 January 2014, <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">ESA scientists</a> reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a> on Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. The detection was made by using the <a href="Far-infrared%20astronomy">far-infrared abilities</a> of the <a href="Herschel%20Space%20Observatory">Herschel Space Observatory</a>. The finding was unexpected because <a href="comet">comet</a>s, not asteroids, are typically considered to "sprout jets and plumes". According to one of the scientists, "The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids."

In 1596, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> predicted “Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet” in his "<a href="Mysterium%20Cosmographicum">Mysterium Cosmographicum</a>". While analyzing <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>'s data, Kepler thought that there was too large a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

In an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of <a href="Charles%20Bonnet">Charles Bonnet</a>'s "Contemplation de la Nature", the astronomer <a href="Johann%20Daniel%20Titius">Johann Daniel Titius</a> of <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a> noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in <a href="astronomical%20units">astronomical units</a> "provided" one allowed for a "missing planet" (equivalent to 24 in the sequence) between the orbits of Mars (12) and Jupiter (48). In his footnote, Titius declared "But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all."

When <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> discovered <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> in 1781, the planet's orbit matched the law almost perfectly, leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

On January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, chair of astronomy at the <a href="University%20of%20Palermo">University of Palermo</a>, Sicily, found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by this pattern. He dubbed it "Ceres", after the <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Roman goddess</a> of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet, but its lack of a <a href="Coma%20%28cometary%29">coma</a> suggested it was a planet.

Thus, the aforementioned pattern, now known as the <a href="Titius%E2%80%93Bode%20law">Titius–Bode law</a>, predicted the <a href="Semi-major%20axis">semi-major axes</a> of all eight planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).

Fifteen months later, <a href="Heinrich%20Olbers">Heinrich Olbers</a> discovered a second object in the same region, <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a>. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared indistinguishable from <a href="star">star</a>s.

Accordingly, in 1802, William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named "asteroids", after the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a> "asteroeides", meaning "star-like". Upon completing a series of observations of Ceres and Pallas, he concluded,

Neither the appellation of planets nor that of comets, can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if I take my name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself, however, the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.
By 1807, further investigation revealed two new objects in the region: <a href="3%20Juno">Juno</a> and <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a>. The burning of <a href="Lilienthal%2C%20Lower%20Saxony">Lilienthal</a> in the <a href="Napoleonic%20wars">Napoleonic wars</a>, where the main body of work had been done, brought this first period of discovery to a close.

Despite Herschel's coinage, for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets and to prefix their names with numbers representing their date of discovery: 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta. However, in 1845 astronomers detected a fifth object (<a href="5%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAstraea">5 Astraea</a>) and, shortly thereafter, new objects were found at an accelerating rate. Counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome. Eventually, they were dropped from the planet list (as first suggested by <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> in the early 1850s) and Herschel's choice of nomenclature, "asteroids", gradually came into common use.

The discovery of <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> in 1846 led to the discrediting of the Titius–Bode law in the eyes of scientists because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, there is no scientific explanation for the law, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.

The expression "asteroid belt" came into use in the very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by <a href="E.%20C.%20Ott%C3%A9">E. C. Otté</a>) of Alexander von Humboldt's "<a href="Cosmos%20%28Humboldt%29">Cosmos</a>": "[...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity". Another early appearance occurred in <a href="Robert%20James%20Mann">Robert James Mann</a>'s "A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens": "The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...]". The American astronomer <a href="Benjamin%20Peirce">Benjamin Peirce</a> seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.

One hundred asteroids had been located by mid-1868, and in 1891 the introduction of <a href="astrophotography">astrophotography</a> by <a href="Max%20Wolf">Max Wolf</a> accelerated the rate of discovery still further. A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921, 10,000 by 1981, and 100,000 by 2000. Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing quantities.

In 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were <a href="Phaeton%20%28hypothetical%20planet%29">fragments of a much larger planet</a> that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. As of 2018, a study was released from researchers at the University of Florida that found the asteroid belt was created from the remnants of several ancient planets instead of a singular planet.

A hypothesis to the asteroid belt creation is that in general, in the Solar System, a <a href="planetary%20formation">planetary formation</a> is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an <a href="Accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accretion</a> process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.

Planetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturbed</a> by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. <a href="Orbital%20resonance">Orbital resonance</a>s occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As <a href="Nice%20model">Jupiter migrated inward</a> following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.

During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and formed <a href="magma">magma</a> oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of <a href="zircon">zircon</a> crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within 10 million years of the Solar System's origin.

The asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens of millions of years), surface melting from impacts, <a href="space%20weathering">space weathering</a> from radiation, and bombardment by <a href="micrometeorites">micrometeorites</a>. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.

The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt. Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained the mass equivalent to the Earth. Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt within about 1 million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass. Since their formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable: there has been no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids.

The 4:1 <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a> with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>, can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed within the radius of this gap were swept up by <a href="Mars">Mars</a> (which has an <a href="aphelion">aphelion</a> at 1.67 AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System. The <a href="Hungaria%20asteroids">Hungaria asteroids</a> lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.

When the asteroid belt was first formed, the temperatures at a distance of 2.7 AU from the Sun formed a "<a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">snow line</a>" below the freezing point of water. Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice.
In 2006 it was announced that a population of <a href="Main-belt%20comet">comets</a> had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient <a href="outgassing">outgassing</a> of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.

Contrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100 km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between 700,000 and 1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more. The <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s of most of the known asteroids are between 11 and 19, with the median at about 16.

The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be between and kilograms, which is just 4% of the mass of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. The four largest objects, <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a>, <a href="4%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVesta">4 Vesta</a>, <a href="2%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BPallas">2 Pallas</a>, and <a href="10%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHygiea">10 Hygiea</a>, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.

The current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous asteroids, S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.

<a href="C-type%20asteroid">Carbonaceous asteroids</a>, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low <a href="albedo">albedo</a>. Their surface composition is similar to <a href="carbonaceous%20chondrite">carbonaceous chondrite</a> <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and <a href="volatiles">volatiles</a> removed.

<a href="S-type%20asteroid">S-type</a> (<a href="silicate">silicate</a>-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.

<a href="M-type%20asteroid">M-type</a> (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel. Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid <a href="22%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BKalliope">22 Kalliope</a> does not appear to be primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7 AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.

One mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of <a href="V-type%20asteroid">V-type</a> or <a href="basaltic">basaltic</a> asteroids. Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock, resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or <a href="olivine">olivine</a>. Observations, however, suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing. Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type). However, the discovery of the asteroid <a href="1459%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMagnya">1459 Magnya</a> revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then, suggesting a different origin. This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt, <a href="7472%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BKumakiri">7472 Kumakiri</a> and , with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta. These latter two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date.

The temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200 K (−73 °C) at 2.2 AU down to 165 K (−108 °C) at 3.2 AU However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.

Several otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show <a href="comet">comet</a>ary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through the capture of classical comets, it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans because the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.

Most asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.

Sometimes, the term "main belt" is used to refer only to the more compact "core" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 <a href="Kirkwood%20gap">Kirkwood gap</a>s at 2.06 and 3.27 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>, and at <a href="eccentricity%20%28orbit%29">orbital eccentricities</a> less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital <a href="inclination">inclination</a>s below about 20°. , this "core" region contained 93% of all discovered and numbered minor planets within the Solar System. The <a href="JPL%20Small-Body%20Database">JPL Small-Body Database</a> lists over 670,000 known main belt asteroids.

The <a href="Semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes">semi-major axis</a> of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a>. In 1866, <a href="Daniel%20Kirkwood">Daniel Kirkwood</a> announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. They were located in positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.

When the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, a <a href="mean-motion%20resonance">mean-motion resonance</a> with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new <a href="orbital%20element">orbital element</a>s. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.

The gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.

The main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU.)

The main or core population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps:

The asteroid belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5 AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, and outer belts; also see diagram).

The high population of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10 km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading to the formation of a new <a href="asteroid%20family">asteroid family</a>). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.

Along with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the <a href="Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson%20effect">Poynting–Robertson effect</a>, the pressure of <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a> causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>.

The combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the <a href="zodiacal%20light">zodiacal light</a>. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> along the plane of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>. Asteroid particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40 μm in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000 years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt. It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the <a href="zodiacal%20light">zodiacal light</a>. However, computer simulations by Nesvorný and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.

Some of the debris from collisions can form <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>s that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Of the 50,000 <a href="meteorites">meteorites</a> found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.

In 1918, the Japanese astronomer <a href="Kiyotsugu%20Hirayama">Kiyotsugu Hirayama</a> noticed that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters, forming families or groups.

Approximately one-third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the asteroid belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20 to 30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features. Smaller associations of asteroids are called groups or clusters.

Some of the most prominent families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the <a href="Flora%20family">Flora</a>, <a href="Eunomia%20family">Eunoma</a>, <a href="Koronis%20family">Koronis</a>, <a href="Eos%20family">Eos</a>, and <a href="Themis%20family">Themis</a> families. The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than 1 billion years ago.
The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the <a href="Gefion%20family">Gefion family</a>) is 4 Vesta. The <a href="Vesta%20family">Vesta family</a> is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the <a href="HED%20meteorite">HED meteorite</a>s may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.

Three prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.

The main belt evolution after the Late Heavy Bombardment was very likely affected by the passages of large Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
Centaurs and TNOs that reach the inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though only if their mass is of the order of for single encounters or, one order less in case of multiple close encounters.
However Centaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid families in the main belt, but they can have perturbed some old asteroid families. Current main belt asteroids that originated as Centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetime of less than 4 million years, most likely between 2.8 and 3.2 AU at larger eccentricities than typical of main belt asteroid.

Skirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9 AU) is the <a href="Hungaria%20family">Hungaria family</a> of minor planets. They are named after the main member, <a href="434%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHungaria">434 Hungaria</a>; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.

Another high-inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the <a href="Phocaea%20family">Phocaea family</a>. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some <a href="E-type%20asteroid">E-types</a>. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.

Skirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the <a href="Cybele%20asteroid">Cybele group</a>, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5 AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The <a href="Hilda%20family">Hilda family</a> orbit between 3.5 and 4.2 AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2 AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of <a href="Trojan%20asteroid">Trojan asteroid</a>s can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1 km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.

Some asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The <a href="Karin%20Cluster">Karin Cluster</a> apparently formed about 5.7 million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33 km in radius. The <a href="490%20Veritas">Veritas family</a> formed about 8.3 million years ago; evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered from ocean sediment.

More recently, the <a href="1270%20Datura">Datura cluster</a> appears to have formed about 530,000 years ago from a collision with a main-belt asteroid. The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits, rather than from any physical evidence. However, this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material. Other recent cluster formations, such as the <a href="4652%20Iannini">Iannini cluster</a> ( million years ago), may have provided additional sources of this asteroid dust.

The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was "<a href="Pioneer%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B10">Pioneer 10</a>", which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecrafts without incident. "<a href="Pioneer%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B11">Pioneer 11</a>", <a href="Voyager%20program">"Voyagers 1" and "2"</a> and "<a href="Ulysses%20probe">Ulysses</a>" passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. "<a href="Galileo%20%28spacecraft%29">Galileo</a>" imaged <a href="951%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BGaspra">951 Gaspra</a> in 1991 and <a href="243%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIda">243 Ida</a> in 1993, <a href="NEAR%20Shoemaker">NEAR</a> imaged <a href="253%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMathilde">253 Mathilde</a> in 1997 and landed on 433 Eros in February 2001, "<a href="Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini</a>" imaged <a href="2685%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMasursky">2685 Masursky</a> in 2000, "<a href="Stardust%20%28spacecraft%29">Stardust</a>" imaged <a href="5535%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAnnefrank">5535 Annefrank</a> in 2002, "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" imaged <a href="132524%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAPL">132524 APL</a> in 2006, "<a href="Rosetta%20%28spacecraft%29">Rosetta</a>" imaged <a href="2867%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%C5%A0teins">2867 Šteins</a> in September 2008 and <a href="21%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLutetia">21 Lutetia</a> in July 2010, and "<a href="Dawn%20%28spacecraft%29">Dawn</a>" orbited <a href="4%20Vesta">Vesta</a> between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited <a href="Ceres%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Ceres</a> since March 2015. On its way to Jupiter, "<a href="Juno%20%28spacecraft%29">Juno</a>" traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than 1 in 1 billion.

Most belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief <a href="planetary%20flyby">flyby</a> opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the "Dawn", NEAR and "<a href="Hayabusa">Hayabusa</a>" missions have studied asteroids for a protracted period in orbit and at the surface.

Æthelflæd

Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians ( 870 – 12 June 918) ruled <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> in the <a href="The%20Midlands">English Midlands</a> from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, king of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdom of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, and his wife <a href="Ealhswith">Ealhswith</a>. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking</a> invasions of <a href="England">England</a>. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> having been conquered, and <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a>. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Mercians">Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians</a>, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under <a href="Viking">Viking</a> control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred.

Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a>. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built <a href="St%20Oswald%27s%20Priory%2C%20Gloucester">a new minster</a> in <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a>, which were <a href="Translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as "one of the most unique events in early medieval history".

Alfred had built a network of fortified <a href="burh">burh</a>s and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were <a href="Bridgnorth">Bridgnorth</a>, <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth</a>, <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a>, <a href="Warwick">Warwick</a>, <a href="Chirbury">Chirbury</a> and <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>. In 917 she sent an army to capture <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, the first of the <a href="Five%20Boroughs%20of%20the%20Danelaw">Five Boroughs of the Danelaw</a> to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as "her greatest triumph". In 918 <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter <a href="%C3%86lfwynn">Ælfwynn</a>, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex.

Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, who described her as "a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul". According to <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a>, "like ... <a href="Elizabeth%20I">ElizabethI</a> she became a wonder to later ages". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison.

Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by Wessex at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ellandun">Battle of Ellandun</a> in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.

In 865 the Viking <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a> landed in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to buy peace and the following year the Vikings invaded <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, where they appointed <a href="Ecgberht%20I%20of%20Northumbria">a puppet king</a> in 867. They then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867–868. King <a href="Burgred">Burgred</a> of Mercia was joined by King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a> of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and his brother, the future King Alfred, for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Vikings conquered East Anglia. In 874 the Vikings expelled King Burgred and <a href="Ceolwulf%20II%20of%20Mercia">Ceolwulf</a> became the last King of Mercia with their support. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. He was described by the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" as "a foolish king's <a href="thegn">thegn</a>" who was a puppet of the Vikings. The historian <a href="Ann%20Williams%20%28historian%29">Ann Williams</a> regards this view as partial and distorted, that he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred. The situation was transformed the following year when Alfred won a decisive victory over the Danes at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a>.

Ceolwulf is not recorded after 879. His successor as the ruler of the English western half of Mercia, Æthelflæd's husband <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Mercians">Æthelred</a>, is first seen in 881 when, according to the historian of medieval Wales, <a href="Thomas%20Charles-Edwards">Thomas Charles-Edwards</a>, he led an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of the north Welsh <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Kingdom of Gwynedd</a>. In 883 he made a grant with the consent of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. In 886 Alfred occupied the Mercian town of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20London">London</a>, which had been in Viking hands. He then received the submission of all English not under Viking control and handed control of London over to Æthelred. In the 890s, Æthelred and <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward</a>, Alfred's son and future successor, fought off more Viking attacks. Alfred died in 899 and Edward's claim to the throne was disputed by <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20%C3%A6theling">Æthelwold</a>, son of Alfred's elder brother. Æthelwold joined forces with the Vikings when he was unable to get sufficient support in Wessex, and his rebellion only ended with his death in battle in December 902.

The most important source for history in this period is the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" but Æthelflæd is almost ignored in the standard West Saxon version, in what F. T. Wainwright calls "a conspiracy of silence". He argues that King Edward was anxious not to encourage Mercian separatism and did not wish to publicise his sister's accomplishments, in case she became a symbol of Mercian claims. Brief details of her actions were preserved in a pro-Mercian version of the "Chronicle" known as the "Mercian Register" or the "Annals of Æthelflæd"; although it is now lost, elements were incorporated into several surviving versions of the "Chronicle". The "Register" covers the years 902 to 924, and focuses on Æthelflæd's actions; Edward is hardly mentioned and her husband only twice, on his death and as father of their daughter. Information about Æthelflæd's career is also preserved in the Irish chronicle known as the "<a href="Three%20Fragments">Three Fragments</a>". According to Wainwright, it "contains much that is legendary rather than historical. But it also contains, especially for our period, much genuine historical information which seems to have its roots in a contemporary narrative." She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> and <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> and she has received more attention from historians than any other secular woman in Anglo-Saxon England.

Æthelflæd was born around 870, the oldest child of King <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> and his <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>n wife, <a href="Ealhswith">Ealhswith</a>, who was a daughter of <a href="%C3%86thelred%20Mucel">Æthelred Mucel</a>, <a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a> of the <a href="Gaini">Gaini</a>, one of the tribes of Mercia. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal house, probably a descendant of King <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf</a> (796–821). Æthelflæd was thus half-Mercian and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was sealed by her marriage to Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are mentioned in Alfred's will, which probably dates to the 880s. Æthelflæd, described only as "my eldest daughter", received an estate and 100 <a href="mancus">mancus</a>es, while Æthelred, the only ealdorman to be mentioned by name, received a sword worth 100 mancuses. Æthelflæd was first recorded as Æthelred's wife in a charter of 887, when he granted two estates to the <a href="see%20of%20Worcester">see of Worcester</a> "with the permission and sign-manual of King Alfred" and the attestors included "Æthelflæd "conjux"". The marriage may have taken place earlier, perhaps when he submitted to Alfred following the recovery of London in 886. Æthelred was much older than Æthelflæd and they had one known child, a daughter called <a href="%C3%86lfwynn">Ælfwynn</a>. <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a>, the eldest son of Edward the Elder and future king of England, was brought up in their court and, in the view of Martin Ryan, certainly joined their campaigns against the Vikings.

Æthelred's descent is unknown. <a href="Richard%20Abels">Richard Abels</a> describes him as "somewhat of a mysterious character", who may have claimed royal blood and been related to King Alfred's father-in-law, Ealdorman Æthelred Mucel. In the view of Ian Walker: "He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the <a href="Hwicce">Hwicce</a> around <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>". <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a> suggests that he was probably the son of King Burgred of Mercia and King Alfred's sister <a href="%C3%86thelswith">Æthelswith</a>, although that would mean that the marriage between Æthelflæd and Æthelred was <a href="Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">uncanonical</a>, because <a href="Catholic%20Church">Rome</a> then forbade marriage between first cousins.

Compared to the rest of England, much of English Mercia —Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire —was unusually stable in the Viking age. It did not suffer major attacks and it did not come under great pressure from Wessex. Mercian scholarship had high prestige at the courts of Alfred and Edward. <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a> was able to preserve considerable intellectual and liturgical continuity and, with Gloucester, became the centre of a Mercian revival under Æthelred and Æthelflæd that extended into the more unstable areas of Staffordshire and Cheshire. Charters show the Mercian leaders supporting the revival by their generosity to monastic communities. In 883 Æthelred granted privileges to <a href="Berkeley%20Abbey">Berkeley Abbey</a> and in the 890s he and Æthelflæd issued a charter in favour of the church of Worcester. This was the only occasion in Alfred's lifetime when they are known to have acted jointly; generally Æthelred acted on his own, usually acknowledging the permission of King Alfred. Æthelflæd witnessed charters of Æthelred in 888, 889 and 896. In 901 Æthelflæd and Æthelred gave land and a golden chalice weighing thirty mancuses to the shrine of Saint <a href="Mildburh">Mildburg</a> at <a href="Wenlock%20Priory">Much Wenlock church</a>.
At the end of the ninth century, Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, with the permission of King Alfred and at the request of Bishop <a href="Werferth">Werferth</a>, described in the charter as "their friend". They granted the church of Worcester a half share of the rights of lordship over the city, covering land rents and the proceeds of justice, and in return the cathedral community agreed in perpetuity to dedicate a psalm to them three times a day and a mass and thirty psalms every Saturday. As the rights of lordship had previously belonged fully to the church, this represented the beginning of transfer from episcopal to secular control of the city. In 904 Bishop Werferth granted a lease of land in the city to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, to be held for the duration of their lives and that of their daughter Ælfwynn. The land was valuable, including most of the city's usable river frontage, and control of it enabled the Mercian rulers to dominate over and profit from the city.

Æthelred's health probably declined at some stage in the decade after Alfred died in 899, and Æthelflæd may have become the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> ruler of Mercia by 902. According to the "Three Fragments", the <a href="Norwegians">Norse</a> (Norwegian) Vikings were expelled from <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> and then made an abortive attack on Wales. When this failed they applied to Æthelflæd, her husband being ill, for permission to settle near <a href="Chester">Chester</a>. Æthelflæd agreed and for some time they were peaceful. The Norse Vikings then joined with the Danes in an attack on Chester, but this failed because Æthelflæd had fortified the town, and she and her husband persuaded the Irish among the attackers to change sides. Other sources confirm that the Norse were driven out of Dublin in 902 and that Æthelflæd fortified Chester in 907. Æthelflæd re-founded Chester as a <a href="burh">burh</a> and she is believed to have enhanced its Roman defences by running walls from the north-west and south-east corners of the fort to the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Wales">River Dee</a>. Simon Ward, who excavated an Anglo-Saxon site in Chester, sees the later prosperity of the town as owing much to the planning of Æthelflæd and Edward. After Æthelflæd's death, Edward encountered fierce resistance to his efforts to consolidate his control of the north-west and he died there in 924, shortly after suppressing a local rebellion.

In 909 Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to the northern Danelaw, where it raided for five weeks. The remains of the royal Northumbrian saint <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a> were seized and taken from his resting place in <a href="Bardney%20Abbey">Bardney Abbey</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> to Gloucester. In the late ninth century Gloucester had become a burh with a street plan similar to <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, and Æthelred and Æthelflæd had repaired its ancient Roman defences. In 896 a meeting of the Mercian <a href="witan">witan</a> was held in the royal hall at Kingsholm, just outside the town. The Mercian rulers built a new minster in Gloucester and, although the building was small, it was embellished on a grand scale, with rich sculpture. It was initially dedicated to St Peter but when Oswald's remains were brought to Gloucester in 909, Æthelflæd had them <a href="Translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> from Bardney to the new minster, which was renamed <a href="St%20Oswald%27s%20Priory%2C%20Gloucester">St Oswald's</a> in his honour. The relics gave the church great prestige as Oswald had been one of the most important founding saints of Anglo-Saxon Christianity as well as a ruling monarch, and the decision to translate his relics to Gloucester shows the importance of the town to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who were buried in St Oswald's Minster. <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> describes the town as "the main seat of their power" and <a href="Carolyn%20M.%20Heighway">Carolyn Heighway</a> believes that the foundation of the church was probably a family and dynastic enterprise, encouraged by Alfred and supported by Edward and Bishop Werferth. Heighway and Michael Hare wrote:

Mercia had a long tradition of venerating royal saints and this was enthusiastically supported by Æthelred and Æthelflæd. Saintly relics were believed to give supernatural legitimacy to rulers' authority, and Æthelflæd was probably responsible for the foundation or re-foundation of <a href="Chester%20Cathedral">Chester Minster</a> and the transfer to it of the remains of the seventh-century Mercian princess <a href="Saint%20Werburgh">Saint Werburgh</a> from <a href="Hanbury%2C%20Staffordshire">Hanbury</a> in Staffordshire. She may also have translated the relics of the martyred Northumbrian prince <a href="Alchmund%20of%20Derby">Ealhmund</a> from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes retaliated against the English attack of the previous year by invading Mercia, raiding as far as <a href="Bridgnorth">Bridgnorth</a> in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>. On their way back they were caught by an English army in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> and their army was destroyed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tettenhall">Battle of Tettenhall</a>, opening the way for the recovery of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia over the next decade.

On her husband's death in 911, Æthelflæd became "Myrcna hlædige", "Lady of the Mercians". Ian Walker describes her succession as the only case of a female ruler of a kingdom in Anglo-Saxon history and "one of the most unique events in early medieval history". In Wessex, royal women were not allowed to play any political role; Alfred's wife was not granted the title of queen and was never a witness to charters. In Mercia, Alfred's sister Æthelswith had been the wife of King <a href="Burgred%20of%20Mercia">Burgred of Mercia</a>; she had witnessed charters as queen and had made grants jointly with her husband and in her own name. Æthelflæd benefited from a Mercian tradition of queenly importance, and was able to play a key role in the history of the early tenth century as Lady of the Mercians, which would not have been possible in Wessex.

When Æthelred died, Edward took control of the Mercian towns of London and <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> and their hinterlands, which Alfred had put under Mercian control. Ian Walker suggests that Æthelflæd accepted this loss of territory in return for recognition by her brother of her position in Mercia. Alfred had constructed a network of fortified burhs in Wessex, and Edward and Æthelflæd now embarked on a programme of extending them to consolidate their defences and provide bases for attacks on the Vikings. According to <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a>, Æthelflæd led Mercian armies on expeditions, which she planned. He commented: "It was through reliance on her guardianship of Mercia that her brother was enabled to begin the forward movement against the southern Danes which is the outstanding feature of his reign".

Æthelflæd had already fortified an unknown location called "Bremesburh" in 910 and in 912 she built defences at Bridgnorth to cover a crossing of the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. In 913 she built forts at <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth</a> to guard against the Danes in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, and in <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a> to cover access from the <a href="Trent%20Valley">Trent Valley</a>. In 914 a Mercian army drawn from Gloucester and Hereford repelled a Viking invasion from Brittany, and the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="Eddisbury%20hill%20fort">Eddisbury hill fort</a> was repaired to protect against invasion from Northumbria or Cheshire, while <a href="Warwick">Warwick</a> was fortified as further protection against the Leicester Danes. In 915 <a href="Chirbury">Chirbury</a> was fortified to guard a route from Wales and <a href="Runcorn">Runcorn</a> on the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>. Defences were built before 914 at <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>, and probably <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> and two other fortresses, at "Scergeat" and "Weardbyrig", which have not been located.

In 917 invasions by three Viking armies failed as Æthelflæd sent an army which captured <a href="Derby">Derby</a> and the territory around it. The town was one of the <a href="Five%20Boroughs%20of%20the%20Danelaw">Five Boroughs of the Danelaw</a>, together with Leicester, <a href="Lincoln%2C%20England">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> and <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a>. Derby was the first to fall to the English; she lost "four of her thegns who were dear to her" in the battle. Tim Clarkson, who describes Æthelflæd as "renowned as a competent war-leader", regards the victory at Derby as "her greatest triumph". At the end of the year, the East Anglian Danes submitted to Edward. In early 918, Æthelflæd gained possession of Leicester without opposition and most of the local Danish army submitted to her. A few months later, the leading men of Danish-ruled <a href="Scandinavian%20York">York</a> offered to pledge their loyalty to Æthelflæd, probably to secure her support against Norse raiders from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, but she died on 12 June 918, before she could take advantage of the offer. No similar offer is known to have been made to Edward. According to the "Three Fragments", in 918 Æthelflæd led an army of Scots and Northumbrian English against forces led by the Norse Viking leader <a href="Ragnall%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Ragnall</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corbridge">Battle of Corbridge</a> in Northumbria. Historians consider this unlikely, but she may have sent a contingent to the battle. Both sides claimed victory but Ragnall was able to establish himself as ruler of Northumbria. In the "Three Fragments", Æthelflæd also formed a defensive alliance with the Scots and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Strathclyde British</a>, a claim accepted by Clarkson.

Little is known of Æthelflæd's relations with the Welsh. The only recorded event took place in 916, when she sent an expedition to avenge the murder of a Mercian <a href="abbot">abbot</a> and his companions; her men destroyed the royal <a href="crannog">crannog</a> of <a href="Brycheiniog">Brycheiniog</a> on <a href="Llangorse%20Lake">Llangorse Lake</a> and captured the queen and thirty-three of her companions. According to a version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" strongly sympathetic to Edward the Elder, after Æthelflæd's death "the kings among the Welsh, Hywel and Clydog and Idwal, and all the Welsh people sought to have [Edward] as their lord". <a href="Hywel%20Dda">Hywel Dda</a> was king of <a href="Dyfed">Dyfed</a> in south-west Wales, Clydog ap Cadell probably king of <a href="Powys">Powys</a> in the north-east, and <a href="Idwal%20ab%20Anarawd">Idwal ab Anarawd</a> king of <a href="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a> in the north-west. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwent">Gwent</a> in south-east Wales was already under West Saxon lordship but, in the view of Charles-Edwards, this passage shows that the other Welsh kingdoms were under Mercian lordship until Edward took direct power over Mercia.

No coins were issued with the name of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian towns with unusual ornamental designs on the reverse and this may have reflected Æthelflæd's desire to distinguish <a href="coin">specie</a> issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the same as those on coins produced in Wessex.

Æthelflæd died at Tamworth on 12June 918 and her body was carried to Gloucester, where she was buried with her husband in their foundation, St Oswald's Minster. According to the "Mercian Register", Æthelflæd was buried in the east <a href="porticus">porticus</a>. A building suitable for a royal mausoleum has been found by archaeological investigation at the east end of the church and this may have been St Oswald's burial place. Placement next to the saint would have been a prestigious burial location for Æthelred and Æthelflæd. William of Malmesbury wrote that their burial places were found in the "south" porticus during building works in the early twelfth century. He may have been misinformed about the position but it is also possible that the tombs were moved from their prestigious position next to the saint, when the couple became less known over time or when tenth-century kings acted to minimise the honour paid to their Mercian predecessors.

The choice of burial place was symbolic. Victoria Thompson argues that if Æthelflæd had chosen Edward's royal mausoleum in Winchester as the burial place for her husband and herself, that would have emphasised Mercia's subordinate status, whereas a traditional Mercian royal burial place such as <a href="Repton">Repton</a> would have been a provocative declaration of independence; Gloucester, near the border with Wessex, was a compromise between the two. Martin Ryan sees the foundation as "something like a royal mausoleum, intended to replace the one at Repton (Derbyshire) that had been destroyed by the Vikings". Æthelflæd died a few months too early to see the final conquest of the southern Danelaw by Edward. She was succeeded as Lady of the Mercians by her daughter, Ælfwynn, but in early December 918 Edward deposed her and took Mercia under his control. Many Mercians disliked the subordination of their ancient kingdom to Wessex, and Wainwright describes the Mercian annalist's description of the deposition of Ælfwynn as "heavy with resentment". Edward died in 924 at <a href="Farndon%2C%20Cheshire">Farndon</a> in Cheshire a few days after putting down a rebellion by Mercians and Welshmen at Chester.

To the West Saxon version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Æthelflæd was merely King Edward's sister, whereas for the "Mercian Register" she was Lady of the Mercians. Irish and Welsh annals described her as a queen and the <a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>, which ignore the deaths of Alfred and Edward, described her as "famosissima regina Saxonum" (renowned Saxon queen). She was also praised by Anglo-Norman historians such as John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury, who described her as "a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul". He claimed that she declined to have sex after the birth of her only child because it was "unbecoming of the daughter of a king to give way to a delight which, after a time, produced such painful consequences". According to Nick Higham, "successive medieval and modern writers were quite captivated by her" and her brother's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison. In the twelfth century, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> paid her his own tribute:
Some historians believe that Æthelred and Æthelflæd were independent rulers. In the "Handbook of British Chronology", <a href="David%20Dumville">David Dumville</a> refers to "Q. Æthelflæd" and comments, "The titles given her by all sources ("hlæfdige, regina") imply that she wielded royal power and authority". Alex Woolf concurs and <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a> describes Æthelflæd as "the last Mercian queen", referred to in charters in such terms as "by the gift of Christ's mercy ruling the government of the Mercians". Stafford argues that Æthelred and Æthelflæd exercised most or all of the powers of a monarch after Alfred's death but it would have been a provocative act formally to claim regality, especially after Æthelwold's rebellion. Stafford sees her as a "warrior queen", "Like ... <a href="Elizabeth%20I">ElizabethI</a> she became a wonder to later ages." According to Charles Insley,

Wainwright sees Æthelflæd as willingly accepting a subordinate role in a partnership with her brother and agreeing to his plan of unification of Wessex and Mercia under his rule. Wainwright argues that he probably sent his oldest son Æthelstan to be brought up in Mercia, to make him more acceptable to the Mercians as king; Æthelflæd does not appear to have tried to find a husband for her daughter, who must have been nearly thirty by 918. In Wainwright's view, she was ignored in West Saxon sources for fear that recognition of her achievements would encourage Mercian separatism:

<a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> points out that all coins were issued in Edward's name, and while the Mercian rulers were able to issue some charters on their own authority, others acknowledged Edward's lordship. In 903 a Mercian ealdorman "petitioned King Edward, and also Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians under the aforesaid king". Keynes argues that a new polity was created when Æthelred submitted to Alfred in the 880s, covering Wessex and English (western) Mercia. In Keynes's view, "the conclusion seems inescapable that the Alfredian polity of the kingship 'of the Anglo-Saxons' persisted in the first quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were thus under Edward's rule from the beginning of his reign". Ryan believes that the Mercian rulers "had a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority".

In Higham's view, Keynes makes a strong case that Edward ruled over an Anglo-Saxon state with a developing administrative and ideological unity but that Æthelflæd and Æthelred did much to encourage a separate Mercian identity, such as establishing cults of Mercian saints at their new burhs, as well as reverence for their great Northumbrian royal saint at Gloucester:

In June 2018, Æthelflæd's funeral was re-enacted in front of a crowd of 10,000 people in Gloucester, as part of a series of living history events marking the 1,100th anniversary of her death.

Cirrus cloud

Cirrus (<a href="list%20of%20cloud%20types">cloud classification</a> symbol: Ci) is a genus of atmospheric <a href="cloud">cloud</a> generally characterized by thin, wispy strands, giving the type its name from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "cirrus", meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair. This cloud can form at any <a href="altitude">altitude</a> between and above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>. The strands of cloud sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form referred to by the common name of "mares' tails".

From the surface of Earth, cirrus typically appears white, or a light
grey in color. It forms when <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a> undergoes <a href="deposition%20%28phase%20transition%29">deposition</a> at altitudes above in temperate regions and above in tropical regions. It also forms from the outflow of <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s or the <a href="anvil%20cloud">anvils</a> of <a href="cumulonimbus%20clouds">cumulonimbus clouds</a>. Since cirrus clouds arrive in advance of the <a href="frontal%20system">frontal system</a> or <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>, it indicates that weather conditions may soon deteriorate. While it indicates the arrival of <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> (rain), cirrus clouds only produce <a href="virga">fall streak</a>s (falling ice crystals that evaporate before landing on the ground).

<a href="Jet%20stream">Jet stream</a>-powered cirrus can grow long enough to stretch across continents while remaining only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces <a href="optical%20phenomena">optical phenomena</a> such as <a href="sun%20dog">sun dog</a>s and <a href="Halo%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">halos</a>. Cirrus is known to raise the temperature of the air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10 °C (18 °F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called <a href="Cirrostratus%20cloud">cirrostratus</a>. <a href="Convection">Convection</a> at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called <a href="Cirrocumulus%20cloud">cirrocumulus</a>, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of <a href="supercooled">supercooled</a> water.

Cirrus clouds form on other <a href="planet">planet</a>s, including <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>, and possibly <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>. They have even been seen on <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> or <a href="methane%20clathrate">methane ice</a> rather than water ice. The term "cirrus" is also used for certain <a href="interstellar%20cloud">interstellar cloud</a>s composed of sub-<a href="Micrometer%20%28unit%29">micrometer</a>-sized dust grains.

Cirrus clouds range in thickness from to , with an average thickness of . There are, on average, 30 <a href="ice%20crystals">ice crystals</a> per <a href="liter">liter</a> (96 ice crystals per <a href="gallon">gallon</a>), but this ranges from one ice crystal per 10,000 liters (3.7 ice crystals per 10,000 gallons) to 10,000 ice crystals per liter (37,000 ice crystals per gallon), a difference of eight <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a>. The length of each of these ice crystals is usually 0.25 millimeters long, but they range from as short as 0.01 millimeters or as long as several millimeters. The ice crystals in <a href="contrail">contrail</a>s are much smaller than those in naturally occurring cirrus cloud, as they are around 0.001 millimeters to 0.1 millimeters in length. Cirrus can vary in temperature from to .

The ice crystals in cirrus clouds have different shapes in addition to different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the ice crystals is determined by the air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice <a href="supersaturation">supersaturation</a>. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to be at the top of the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> region, cirrus clouds tend to be composed up of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.
Scientists have studied the characteristics of cirrus using several different methods. One, <a href="Light%20Detection%20and%20Ranging">Light Detection and Ranging</a> (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried <a href="hygrometer">hygrometer</a>s give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure the depth of the cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the <a href="Stratospheric%20Aerosol%20and%20Gas%20Experiment">Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment</a> (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where <a href="infrared%20radiation">infrared radiation</a> is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. The United States <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>'s (NASA) <a href="Moderate-Resolution%20Imaging%20Spectroradiometer">MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer</a> (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth's infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the "shadow" it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.
Based on data taken from the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary <a href="Diurnal%20cycle">diurnally</a> and seasonally. The researchers found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, with an average of 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.

Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the <a href="virga">virga</a> produced in liquid–water clouds—called <a href="Cavum%20%28cloud%29">fall streaks</a>, and they are made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks are determined by the <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>.
Cirrus comes in four distinct species; Cirrus "castellanus", "fibratus", "spissatus", and "uncinus"; which are each divided into four varieties: "intortus", "vertebratus", "radiatus", and "duplicatus". "Cirrus castellanus" is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. "Cirrus fibratus" looks striated and is the most common cirrus species. "Cirrus uncinus" clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called "mare's tails". Of the varieties, "Cirrus intortus" has an extremely contorted shape, and "cirrus radiatus" has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. <a href="Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz%20instability">Kelvin–Helmholtz waves</a> are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.

Cirrus clouds are formed when water vapor undergoes deposition at high altitudes where the <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> ranges from 600 <a href="Millibars">mbar</a> at above sea level to 200 mbar at above sea level. These conditions commonly occur at the leading edge of a <a href="warm%20front">warm front</a>. Because humidity is low at such high altitudes, this genus-type tends to be very thin. Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of super cooled water droplets in regions where air temperature is lower than -20 °C or -30 °C.Cirrus usually occur in fair weather. They are formed when it is high enough to be cold and freeze the water drops into ice. They sometimes may be caused by turbulence and wind shear, or by upper-tropospheric convection. Sometimes they are like blown out ice-crystals spreading from the top of a dying cumulonimbus.

Cirrus forms from tropical cyclones, and is commonly seen fanning out from the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eyewalls</a> of <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s. A large shield of cirrus and <a href="cirrostratus%20cloud">cirrostratus</a> typically accompanies the high altitude <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> of hurricanes or <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>s, and these can make the underlying <a href="rain%20band">rain band</a>s—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.

<a href="Thunderstorm">Thunderstorm</a>s can form dense cirrus at their tops. As the cumulonimbus cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze when the air temperature reaches the <a href="freezing%20point">freezing point</a>. The <a href="anvil%20cloud">anvil cloud</a> takes its shape because the <a href="temperature%20inversion">temperature inversion</a> at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches <a href="downwind">downwind</a> as much as several kilometers.

Individual cirrus cloud formations can be the remnants of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms. In the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud, when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated, the mat of cirrus in the anvil is all that is left.

<a href="Contrail">Contrail</a>s are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles, which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing <a href="ice%20nuclei">ice nuclei</a> when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the <a href="Environmental%20impact%20of%20aviation">environmental impacts of aviation</a> is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.

Cirrus Fibratus clouds appear thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, they are the most common type of cirrus cloud. They might indicate windy weather, since they are mostly formed by <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> on higher altitudes.

Cirrus Uncinus are similar, except that they always have a hook or curl on the tip.

Cirrus Spissatus clouds are the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher <a href="tropopause">tropopause</a> or even at the lower <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>. They are dense and opaque, not allowing the light of the sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of <a href="cumulonimbus">cumulonimbus</a> clouds.

Cirrus Floccus is derived from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, which means "lock of wool" or cirrus with ragged bases. They are not to be confused with cirrocumulus floccus since they are larger than <a href="cirrocumulus">cirrocumulus</a> and mostly are isolated. A precipitation-based supplementary feature <a href="virga">virga</a> is mostly visible, which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between cirrocumulus floccus and cirrus floccus.

Cirrus Castellanus is derived from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, which means "castle" or round turrets. They indicate that <a href="atmospheric%20instability">atmospheric instability</a> is occurring on the higher altitudes of the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a>. They appear as tall clouds that originate from a flat base.

Cirrus clouds are translucent and so have no opacity-based varieties; only one species is opaque, which is cirrus spissatus.

Cirrus Intortus clouds is derived from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> which means "twisted", or "wound". These clouds appear twisted, or simply, intorted.

Cirrus Vertebratus clouds, resembling the appearance of bones as hinted by the word "vertebratus". They look more like fish bones, with fibrous lines that originate from one which resembles the appearance of fish bones.

Cirrus Radiatus clouds appear as parallel lines that seem to originate from one point and can stretch for hundreds of miles, and they move parallel to the wind shear.

Random, isolated cirrus do not have any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching <a href="Weather%20front">frontal system</a> or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a <a href="cirrus%20castellanus%20cloud">cirrus castellanus</a>, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the "cirrus radiatus" variety or "cirrus fibratus" species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into <a href="Altocumulus%20cloud">altocumulus</a> and <a href="Altostratus%20cloud">altostratus</a>. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing <a href="nimbostratus%20cloud">nimbostratus cloud</a>s. When cirrus clouds precede a <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>, <a href="squall%20line">squall line</a> or <a href="multicellular%20thunderstorm">multicellular thunderstorm</a>, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.

Within the tropics, 36 hours prior to the center passage of a tropical cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the direction of the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in <a href="Havana%2C%20Cuba">Havana, Cuba</a>, Father <a href="Benito%20Vines">Benito Viñes</a>, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, "Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles".

Cirrus clouds cover nothing to 25% of the Earth (up to 70% in the tropics) and have a net heating effect. When they are thin and translucent, the clouds efficiently absorb outgoing <a href="infrared">infrared</a> radiation while only marginally reflecting the incoming sunlight. When cirrus clouds are thick, they reflect only around 9% of the incoming sunlight, but they prevent almost 50% of the outgoing infrared radiation from escaping, thus raising the temperature of the atmosphere beneath the clouds by an average of 10 °C (18 °F)—a process known as the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a>. Averaged worldwide, cloud formation results in a temperature loss of 5 °C (9 °F) at the earth's surface, mainly the result of <a href="stratocumulus%20cloud">stratocumulus cloud</a>s.

As a result of their warming effects when relatively thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a <a href="positive%20feedback">positive feedback</a> circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of <a href="Solar%20irradiance">solar radiation</a> and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.

A similar hypothesis put forth by <a href="Richard%20Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a> is the <a href="iris%20hypothesis">iris hypothesis</a> in which an increase in tropical <a href="sea%20surface%20temperatures">sea surface temperatures</a> results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.

Cirrus clouds, like <a href="Cirrostratus">cirrostratus clouds</a>, can produce several optical effects, such as <a href="Halo%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">halos</a> around the sun and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, can result in a wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common <a href="halo%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">halo</a> varieties are the <a href="22%C2%B0%20halo">22° halo</a>, <a href="sun%20dogs">sun dogs</a>, the <a href="circumzenithal%20arc">circumzenithal arc</a> and the <a href="circumhorizontal%20arc">circumhorizontal arc</a> (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by <a href="cirrostratus">cirrostratus</a>.

More rarely, cirrus clouds are capable of producing <a href="Glory%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">glories</a>, more commonly associated with liquid water-based clouds such as <a href="Stratus%20cloud">stratus</a>. A glory is a set of concentric, faintly-colored glowing rings that appear around the shadow of the observer, and are best observed from a high viewpoint or from a plane. Cirrus clouds only form glories when the constituent ice crystals are <a href="wikt%3Aaspherical">aspherical</a>, and researchers suggest that the ice crystals must be between 0.009 millimeters and 0.015 millimeters in length. 
Cirrus clouds are one of three different genera of high-étage (high-level) clouds. High-étage clouds form at and above in temperate regions. The other two genera, <a href="cirrocumulus%20cloud">cirrocumulus</a> and cirrostratus, are also high clouds.

In the intermediate range, from to in temperate regions, are the mid-étage clouds. They comprise two or three genera depending on the system of height classification being used: <a href="altostratus%20cloud">altostratus</a>, <a href="altocumulus%20cloud">altocumulus</a>, and, according to <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">WMO</a> classification, <a href="nimbostratus%20cloud">nimbostratus</a>. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.

Low-étage clouds form at less than . The two genera that are strictly low-étage are <a href="stratus%20cloud">stratus</a>, and <a href="stratocumulus%20cloud">stratocumulus</a>. These clouds are composed of water droplets, except during winter when they are formed of <a href="supercooled%20water">supercooled water</a>droplets or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing. Two additional genera usually form in the low altitude range, but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity. They comprise the genera <a href="cumulus%20cloud">cumulus</a>, and <a href="cumulonimbus%20cloud">cumulonimbus</a>, which along with <a href="Nimbostratus%20cloud">nimbostratus</a>, are often classified separately as clouds of vertical development, especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of super-cooled water droplets or ice crystals.

The altitudes of high-étage clouds like cirrus vary considerably with latitude. In the polar regions, they are at their lowest, with a minimum altitude of only to a maximum of . In tropical regions, they are at their highest, ranging in altitude from about to around . In temperate regions, they range in altitude from to —a variation in contrast to low-étage clouds, which do not appreciably change altitude with latitude.

There are three main genera in the family of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds commonly produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as "<a href="cirriform%20cloud">cirriform cloud</a>s" because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.

Cirrocumulus clouds form in sheets or patches and do not cast shadows. They commonly appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like other members of the cumuliform category, formed via <a href="convection">convective</a> processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species: "stratiformis", "lenticularis", "castellanus", and "floccus". They are <a href="iridescence">iridescent</a> when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.

Cirrostratus clouds can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, "fibratus" and "nebulosus". The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.

Cirrus clouds have been observed on several other planets. On 18 September 2008, the Martian Lander "<a href="Phoenix%20Lander">Phoenix</a>" took a <a href="time-lapse">time-lapse</a> photograph of a group of cirrus clouds moving across the Martian sky using LiDAR. Near the end of its mission, the Phoenix Lander detected more thin clouds close to the north pole of Mars. Over the course of several days, they thickened, lowered, and eventually began snowing. The total precipitation was only a few thousandths of a millimeter. James Whiteway from <a href="York%20University">York University</a> concluded that "precipitation is a component of the [Martian] <a href="hydrologic%20cycle">hydrologic cycle</a>." These clouds formed during the Martian night in two layers, one around above ground and the other at surface level. They lasted through early morning before being burned away by the sun. The crystals in these clouds were formed at a temperature of , and they were shaped roughly like ellipsoids 0.127 millimeters long and 0.042 millimeters wide.

On Jupiter, cirrus clouds are composed of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. When Jupiter's <a href="South%20Equatorial%20Belt">South Equatorial Belt</a> disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's <a href="Cassini%20probe">Cassini probe</a> detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>. Cirrus clouds composed of <a href="methane">methane</a> ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the <a href="Great%20Dark%20Spot">Great Dark Spot</a>. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.
<a href="Infrared%20cirrus">Interstellar cirrus clouds</a> are composed of tiny dust grains smaller than a <a href="Micrometer%20%28unit%29">micrometer</a> and are therefore not true clouds of this genus which are composed of ice crystals or other frozen liquids. They range from a few <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s to dozens of light years across. While they are not technically cirrus clouds, the dust clouds are referred to as "cirrus" because of their similarity to the clouds on Earth. They also emit infrared radiation, similar to the way cirrus clouds on Earth reflect heat being radiated out into space.

Daylight saving time

Daylight saving time (DST), also daylight savings time or daylight time (United States), also summer time (United Kingdom and others), is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time. In effect, DST causes a lost hour of sleep in the spring and an extra hour of sleep in the fall.

<a href="George%20Hudson%20%28entomologist%29">George Hudson</a> proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895. The <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> and <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> organized the first nationwide implementation starting on April 30, 1916. Many <a href="daylight%20saving%20time%20by%20country">countries have used</a> at various times since then, particularly since the <a href="1970s%20energy%20crisis">1970s energy crisis</a>. DST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it, while equatorial Brazil does not. Only a minority of the world's population uses DST, because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.

DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns. Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically, but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing.

<a href="Industrial%20society">Industrialized societies</a> usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of <a href="Public%20transport">mass transit</a>, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an <a href="agrarian%20society">agrarian society</a>'s daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by <a href="solar%20time">solar time</a>, which change <a href="season">season</a>ally because of the Earth's <a href="axial%20tilt">axial tilt</a>. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.

By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of <a href="standard%20time">standard time</a>, individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities. However, they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter.

While the times of sunrise and sunset change at roughly equal rates as the seasons change, proponents of Daylight Saving Time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical <a href="Working%20time%23Workweek%20structure">"nine to five"</a> workday. Supporters have also argued that DST decreases <a href="energy%20consumption">energy consumption</a> by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is <a href="%23Dispute%20over%20benefits%20and%20drawbacks">heavily disputed</a>.

The manipulation of time at higher latitudes (for example <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> or <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a>, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.

Ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn. For example, the <a href="Roman%20timekeeping">Romans kept time</a> with <a href="water%20clock">water clock</a>s that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise (<a href="terce">"hora tertia"</a>) started at 09:02 <a href="solar%20time">solar time</a> and lasted 44 minutes at the winter <a href="solstice">solstice</a>, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. From the 14th century onwards, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so <a href="civil%20time">civil time</a> no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a> and all Jewish ceremonies.

<a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> published the proverb "early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise", and he published a letter in the "<a href="Journal%20de%20Paris">Journal de Paris</a>" during his time as an American envoy to France (1776–1785) suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.

In 1810, the Spanish National Assembly <a href="Cortes%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Cortes of Cádiz</a> issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from May 1 to September 30 in recognition of seasonal changes, but it did not actually change the clocks. It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions, but they did so of their own volition.

New Zealand entomologist <a href="George%20Hudson%20%28entomologist%29">George Hudson</a> first proposed modern DST. His shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895, he presented a paper to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20New%20Zealand%23Regional%20Constituent%20Organisations">Wellington Philosophical Society</a> proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and considerable interest was expressed in <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>; he followed up with an 1898 paper. Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman <a href="William%20Willett">William Willett</a>, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day. Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, and he published the proposal two years later. Liberal Party member of parliament <a href="Robert%20Pearce%20%28British%20politician%29">Robert Pearce</a> took up the proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.

<a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Ontario">Port Arthur, Ontario</a> was the first city in the world to enact DST on July 1, 1908. This was followed by <a href="Orillia">Orillia</a>, Ontario, introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from 1911 to 1912. The first states to adopt DST () nationally were those of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> and its <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> ally <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> commencing April 30, 1916 as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">allies</a>, and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned daylight saving time in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, Ireland, and the United States. However, many places adopted it for periods of time during the following decades, and it became common during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It became widely adopted in America and Europe starting in the 1970s as a result of the <a href="1970s%20energy%20crisis">1970s energy crisis</a>. Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.
For specific details, see <a href="Daylight%20saving%20time%20by%20country">Daylight saving time by country</a>.

Clock shifts are usually scheduled at, or soon after, midnight and on a weekend to lessen disruption to weekday schedules. A one-hour shift is customary but twenty minute and two hour shifts have been used in the past. In all countries that use daylight saving, the clock is advanced in spring and set back in autumn; the spring change reduces the length of that day and the autumn change increases it. For a midnight shift in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 11:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0.

The time at which clocks are to be shifted differs across jurisdictions. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> has a coordinated shift, shifting all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 <a href="Central%20European%20Time">Central European Time</a> (CET) or 03:00 <a href="Eastern%20European%20Time">Eastern European Time</a> (EET), the result is that the time differences across European time zone remain constant. North America shifts at 02:00 but at the local time and is consequently uncoordinated so that, for example, <a href="Mountain%20Time%20Zone">Mountain Time</a> is, for one hour, zero hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of one hour ahead in the autumn and two hours instead of one ahead of <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific Time</a> in the spring.

The dates on which clocks are to be shifted also vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">North American Eastern Time</a>, except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours a few weeks per year. Since 1996, <a href="European%20Summer%20Time">European Summer Time</a> has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland <a href="Time%20in%20Chile">Chile</a> observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at local time. In some countries time is governed by regional jurisdictions within the country so that some jurisdictions shift and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

From year to year, the shift dates may change for political and social reasons. The 2007 U.S. change was part of the <a href="Energy%20Policy%20Act%20of%202005">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a>; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31. In the past, <a href="Australia%20Central%20Daylight%20Time">Australian</a> state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates; for example, in 2008 most DST-observing states shifted clocks forward on October 5 but <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> shifted on October 26.

Daylight saving has caused controversy since it began. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> argued that it enlarges "the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country" and pundits have dubbed it "Daylight Slaving Time". Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening entertainment interests have opposed it; its initial adoption was prompted by energy crises and war.

The fate of Willett's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues. It attracted many supporters, including <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a>, Churchill, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> (who used half-hour DST at Sandringham or "<a href="Sandringham%20time">Sandringham time</a>"), the managing director of <a href="Harrods">Harrods</a>, and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition was stronger, including Prime Minister <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, <a href="William%20Christie%20%28astronomer%29">William Christie</a> (the <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a>), <a href="George%20Darwin">George Darwin</a>, <a href="Napier%20Shaw">Napier Shaw</a> (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre owners. After many hearings, the proposal was narrowly defeated in a parliamentary committee vote in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. The U.S. was even more skeptical; <a href="Andrew%20James%20Peters">Andrew Peters</a> introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.

Germany led the way by starting DST () during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> on April 30, 1916 together with <a href="Central%20Powers">its allies</a> to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts. The political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21, 1916. U.S. retailing and manufacturing interests led by <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but they were opposed by railroads. The U.S.'s 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918.

The war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception; it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). The U.S. was more typical; Congress repealed DST after 1919. President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> was also an avid golfer like Willet, and he vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> opposed DST as a "deception", reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer. He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 8 a.m. rather than 9 a.m. during the summer of 1922. Some businesses followed suit, though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.

Since Germany's adoption in 1916, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals of DST, with similar politics involved. The <a href="history%20of%20time%20in%20the%20United%20States">history of time in the United States</a> includes DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul</a> and <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, were on different times for two weeks in May 1965 when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time, while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, <a href="Clorox">Clorox</a> and <a href="7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a> provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both senators from <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> voted for it based on the premise that fast-food restaurants sell more French fries during DST, which are made from Idaho potatoes.

A <a href="Queensland%20daylight%20saving%20referendum%2C%201992">referendum on daylight saving</a> was held in <a href="Queensland%2C%20Australia">Queensland, Australia</a>, in 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving. It was defeated with a 54.5% "no" vote, with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan southeast were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Convenience%20Stores">National Association of Convenience Stores</a> successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the <a href="Daylight%20Saving%20for%20South%20East%20Queensland">Daylight Saving for South East Queensland</a> (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in <a href="South%20East%20Queensland">South East Queensland</a>, while the rest of the state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. Queensland Independent member <a href="Peter%20Wellington">Peter Wellington</a> introduced the <a href="Daylight%20Saving%20for%20South%20East%20Queensland%20Referendum%20Act%202010">Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010</a> into the Queensland parliament on April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement. The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.

In the UK, the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Accidents">Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents</a> supports a proposal to observe SDST's additional hour year-round, but that is opposed in some industries, such as postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK. In some Muslim countries, DST is temporarily abandoned during <a href="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> (the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner. Iran maintains DST during Ramadan, but most Muslim countries do not use DST, partially for this reason.

Russia declared in 2011 that it would stay in DST all year long, followed by a similar declaration from <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>. Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of winter time morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends to stay there permanently.

Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business. 

Opponents argue that actual energy savings are inconclusive, that DST increases health risks such as heart attack, that DST can disrupt morning activities, and that the act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.

Having a common agreement about the day's layout or schedule has so many advantages that a standard schedule over whole countries or large areas has generally been chosen over efforts in which some people get up earlier and others do not. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because the days are shorter then; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and students may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate. Because of this variation, it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the effects of the practice. The costs and benefits may differ between places. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with other areas rather than for any other benefits.

A 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of only 0.34% during the days when DST applies. The meta-analysis furthermore found that "electricity savings are larger for countries farther away from the equator, while subtropical regions consume more electricity because of DST." This means that DST may conserve electricity in some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, but be wasteful in other places, such as Mexico, the southern United States, and northern Africa. The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.

The period of Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.

DST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.) Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of <a href="incandescent%20lighting">incandescent lighting</a>, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate.

Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption. The 2008 DOE report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST.

Those who benefit most from DST are the retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses that benefit from extra afternoon sunlight. Having more hours of sunlight in between the end of the typical workday and bedtime induces customers to shop and to participate in outdoor afternoon sports. People are more likely to stop by a store on their way home from work if the sun is still up. In 1984, "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of DST would yield an additional $30 million for <a href="7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a> stores, and the <a href="National%20Golf%20Foundation">National Golf Foundation</a> estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200 million to $300 million. A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s leisure sector by about 3%.

Conversely, DST can harm some farmers, young children, who have difficulty getting enough sleep at night when the evenings are bright, and others whose hours are set by the sun. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer, their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.

DST also hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings, <a href="Drive-in%20theater">drive-ins</a> and other theaters.

Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion, and <a href="Utah%20State%20University">Utah State University</a> economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around US$1.7 billion. Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased <a href="economic%20efficiency">economic efficiency</a>, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.

In 1975 the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">United States Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) conservatively identified a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the <a href="Insurance%20Institute%20for%20Highway%20Safety">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. Four reports have found that this effect is smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.

DST likely reduces some kinds of crime, such as robbery and sexual assault, as fewer potential victims are outdoors after dusk. Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.

In several countries, fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in <a href="Smoke%20detector">smoke</a> and <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20detector">carbon monoxide detector</a>s, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, and seasonal vaccinations. Locations without DST can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders.

A 2017 study in the "<a href="American%20Economic%20Journal">American Economic Journal: Applied Economics</a>" estimated that "the transition into DST caused over 30 deaths at a social cost of $275 million annually," primarily by increasing sleep deprivation.

DST has mixed effects on health. In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The <a href="Retinitis%20Pigmentosa">Retinitis Pigmentosa</a> Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate <a href="Gordon%20Gund">Gordon Gund</a>, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of <a href="ischemic%20stroke">ischemic stroke</a> in the first two days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.

Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian rhythm</a> can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.

The government of <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> cited health complications due to clock shifts as a reason for abolishing DST in 2005. In March 2011, <a href="Dmitri%20Medvedev">Dmitri Medvedev</a>, president of Russia, claimed that "stress of changing clocks" was the motivation for Russia to stay in DST all year long. Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides.

An unexpected adverse effect of daylight saving time may lie in the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.

In 2017, researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> reported that judges who experienced sleep deprivation as a result of DST tended to issue longer sentences.

DST's clock shifts have the obvious disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.

Damage to a German steel facility occurred during a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system linked to a radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, <a href="Unix">Unix</a>-based computer systems use the UTC-based <a href="Unix%20time">Unix time</a> internally.

Some clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented.

DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of <a href="standard%20time">standard time</a>. For example, when reading a <a href="sundial">sundial</a>, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.

As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form "daylight savings time" (with an "s") was already in 1978 much more common than the older form "daylight saving time" in American English ("the change has been virtually accomplished"). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. ("Although "daylight saving time" is considered correct, "daylight savings time" (with an "s") is commonly used.") The first two words are sometimes hyphenated ("daylight-saving(s) time"). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving (without "time"), daylight savings (without "time"), and daylight time. The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows: "Although the singular form "daylight saving time" is the original one, dating from the early 20th century—and is preferred by some usage critics—the plural form is now extremely common in AmE. [...] The rise of "daylight savings time" appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when "saving" is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether "saving" is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using "savings" as the adjective—as in "savings account" or "savings bond"—makes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form."

In Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal used the term "daylight saving", but by 1911 the term "summer time" replaced "daylight saving time" in draft legislation. The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: "Sommerzeit" in German, "zomertijd" in Dutch, "kesäaika" in Finnish, "horario de verano" or "hora de verano" in Spanish, and "<a href="w%3Afr%3Aheure%20d%27%C3%A9t%C3%A9">heure d'été</a>" in French.

The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces "standard" with "daylight": for example, "<a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific Standard Time</a>" ("PST") becomes "Pacific Daylight Time" ("PDT"). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is "<a href="British%20Summer%20Time">British Summer Time</a>" (BST), and British English typically inserts "summer" into other time zone names, e.g. "<a href="Central%20European%20Time">Central European Time</a>" ("CET") becomes "<a href="Central%20European%20Summer%20Time">Central European Summer Time</a>" ("CEST").

The North American English mnemonic "spring forward, fall back" (also "spring ahead ...", "spring up ...", and "... fall behind") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.

Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the <a href="Energy%20Policy%20Act%20of%202005%23Change%20to%20daylight%20saving%20time">2007 change to DST rules</a> in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate <a href="Information%20technology">information technologists</a>.

Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.
Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.

However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external <a href="leap%20second">leap second</a> updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the <a href="tz%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bdatabase">tz database</a> also known as zoneinfo.

The <a href="tz%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bdatabase">tz database</a> maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most <a href="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> operating systems, <a href="Java%20%28Sun%29">Java</a>, and the <a href="Oracle%20RDBMS">Oracle RDBMS</a>; <a href="Hewlett-Packard">HP</a>'s "tztab" database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ <a href="environment%20variable">environment variable</a> specifies the <a href="List%20of%20tz%20zones%20by%20name">location name</a>, as in codice_1. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the file, which is usually a <a href="symbolic%20link">symbolic link</a> or <a href="hard%20link">hard link</a> to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent <a href="epoch%20time">epoch time</a>; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.

Older or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by <a href="POSIX">POSIX</a>, which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, codice_2 specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.

As with zoneinfo, a user of <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a> supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.

These limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> varied each year and was skipped some years. <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In <a href="Windows%2098">Windows 98</a>, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 <a href="Israeli%20Daylight%20Saving%20Law">Israeli Daylight Saving Law</a> established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>.

Microsoft Windows keeps the system <a href="real-time%20clock">real-time clock</a> in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when <a href="multi%20boot">multi boot</a>ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a <a href="Windows%20registry">Windows registry</a> entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when <a href="Windows%20NT">Windows NT</a> supported <a href="RISC">RISC</a> machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.

The <a href="NTFS">NTFS</a> file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the <a href="File%20Allocation%20Table">FAT</a> filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some <a href="file%20archiver">file archiver</a>s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a <a href="checksum%20algorithm">checksum algorithm</a>). A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.

A move to "permanent daylight saving time" (staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, Canada (e.g. <a href="Time%20in%20Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>), Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Morocco, Namibia, Singapore, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It could be a result of following the timezone of a neighbouring region, political will, or other causes. Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts. However, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.

Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter, so the country switched permanently back to standard time in 2014 for the whole Russian Federation. The United Kingdom and Ireland also experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971, and put clocks forward by an extra hour during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

In the United States, the Florida legislature passed a bill to enact permanent DST; and California, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have introduced proposals or commissions to that effect. Although 26 states have considered making DST permanent, unless Congress changes federal law, states can not implement permanent DST—states can only opt out of DST, not standard time.

H.M.S. Pinafore

H.M.S. Pinafore; or, The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a <a href="comic%20opera">comic opera</a> in two acts, with music by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> and a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>. It opened at the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a> in London, on 25 May 1878 and ran for 571 performances, which was the second-longest run of any <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a> piece up to that time. "H.M.S. Pinafore" was <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s fourth operatic collaboration and their first international sensation.

The story takes place aboard the ship <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Ship">HMS</a> "Pinafore". The <a href="captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a>'s daughter, Josephine, is in love with a lower-class <a href="Able%20Seaman%20%28rank%29">sailor</a>, Ralph Rackstraw, although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. She abides by her father's wishes at first, but Sir Joseph's advocacy of the equality of humankind encourages Ralph and Josephine to overturn conventional social order. They declare their love for each other and eventually plan to elope. The captain discovers this plan, but, as in many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise disclosure changes things dramatically near the end of the story.

Drawing on several of his earlier "<a href="Bab%20Ballads">Bab Ballad</a>" poems, Gilbert imbued this plot with mirth and silliness. The opera's humour focuses on love between members of different <a href="social%20class">social class</a>es and lampoons the British class system in general. "Pinafore" also pokes good-natured fun at <a href="patriotism">patriotism</a>, party politics, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority. The title of the piece comically applies the name of a garment for girls and women, a <a href="pinafore">pinafore</a>, to the fearsome symbol of a warship.

"Pinafore's" extraordinary popularity in Britain, America and elsewhere was followed by the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works, including "<a href="The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>". Their works, later known as the <a href="Savoy%20opera">Savoy opera</a>s, dominated the musical stage on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a decade and continue to be performed today. The structure and style of these operas, particularly "Pinafore", were much copied and contributed significantly to the <a href="Development%20of%20musical%20theatre">development of modern musical theatre</a>.

In 1875, <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>, who was then managing the <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a> for <a href="Selina%20Dolaro">Selina Dolaro</a>, brought <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled "<a href="Trial%20by%20Jury">Trial by Jury</a>". This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly Carte assembled a group of <a href="Equity%20partner">financial backers</a> to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera. This next opera was "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>", which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178 performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and <a href="Organ%20grinder">street musicians</a> played the melodies.

Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support. They were therefore able to choose their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre. They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more <a href="Naturalism%20%28theatre%29">naturalistic</a> style of performance than was commonly used at the time. They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers. The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience; as critic <a href="Herman%20Klein">Herman Klein</a> wrote: "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings. ... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight."
The success of "The Sorcerer" paved the way for another collaboration by Gilbert and Sullivan. Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the Comedy Opera Company, and Gilbert began work on "H.M.S. Pinafore" before the end of 1877. Gilbert's father had been a <a href="ship%27s%20doctor">naval surgeon</a>, and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him. He drew on several of his earlier "<a href="Bab%20Ballads">Bab Ballad</a>" poems (many of which also have nautical themes), including "Captain Reece" (1868) and "General John" (1867). Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads: Dick Deadeye is based on a character in "Woman's Gratitude" (1869); an early version of Ralph Rackstraw can be seen in "Joe Go-Lightly" (1867), with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him; and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from "The Bumboat Woman's Story" (1870). On 27 December 1877, while Sullivan was on holiday on the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>, Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note:
Despite Gilbert's disclaimer, audiences, critics and even the <a href="Prime%20Minister">Prime Minister</a> identified Sir Joseph Porter with W. H. Smith, a politician who had recently been appointed <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> despite having neither military nor nautical experience. Sullivan was delighted with the sketch, and Gilbert read a first draft of the plot to Carte in mid-January.

Following the example of his mentor, <a href="Thomas%20William%20Robertson">T. W. Robertson</a>, Gilbert strove to ensure that the costumes and sets were as realistic as possible. When preparing the sets for "H.M.S. Pinafore", Gilbert and Sullivan visited <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> in April 1878 to inspect ships. Gilbert made sketches of <a href="HMS%20Victory">H.M.S. "Victory"</a> and <a href="HMS%20St%20Vincent%20%281815%29">H.M.S. "St Vincent"</a> and created a model set for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged. This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert's <a href="Theatre%20director">stage management</a> and would be repeated in all of his <a href="Savoy%20Opera">Savoy Opera</a>s. Gilbert's focus on visual accuracy provided a "right-side-up for topsy-turvydom", that is, a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations. Sullivan was "in the full swing" of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878. The bright and cheerful music of "Pinafore" was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April, and at the beginning of May 1878, the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan's flat to finalise the piece.

In "Pinafore", Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte used several of the principal cast members whom they had assembled for "The Sorcerer". As Gilbert had suggested to Sullivan in December 1877, "Mrs. Cripps [Little Buttercup] will be a capital part for <a href="Harriet%20Everard">Everard</a> ... <a href="Rutland%20Barrington">Barrington</a> will be a capital captain, and <a href="George%20Grossmith">Grossmith</a> a first-rate First Lord." However, <a href="Mrs%20Howard%20Paul">Mrs Howard Paul</a>, who had played Lady Sangazure in "The Sorcerer", was declining vocally. She was under contract to play the role of Cousin Hebe in "Pinafore". Gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite Sullivan's reluctance to use her, but by mid-May 1878, both Gilbert and Sullivan wanted her out of the cast; unhappy with the role, she left. With only a week to go before opening night, Carte hired a concert singer, <a href="Jessie%20Bond">Jessie Bond</a>, to play Cousin Hebe. Since Bond had little experience as an actress, Gilbert and Sullivan cut the dialogue out of the role, except for a few lines in the last scene, which they turned into <a href="recitative">recitative</a>. Other new cast members were <a href="Emma%20Howson">Emma Howson</a> and George Power in the romantic roles, who were improvements on the romantic <a href="soprano">soprano</a> and <a href="tenor">tenor</a> in "The Sorcerer".

Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the <a href="overture">overture</a> for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case <a href="Alfred%20Cellier">Alfred Cellier</a>, to complete. "Pinafore" opened on 25 May 1878 at the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a>.


The British warship H.M.S. "Pinafore" is at anchor off <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. The sailors are on the <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">quarterdeck</a>, proudly "cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc."

Little Buttercup, a Portsmouth "<a href="bumboat">bumboat</a> woman" (dockside vendor) – who is the "rosiest, roundest, and reddest beauty in all <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>" – comes on board to sell her wares to the crew. She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her "gay and frivolous exterior". Ralph Rackstraw, "the smartest lad in all the fleet", enters, declaring his love for the Captain's daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick Deadeye, the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned.
The gentlemanly and popular Captain Corcoran greets his "gallant crew" and compliments them on their politeness, saying that he returns the favour by never ("well, hardly ever") using bad language, such as "a big, big D". After the sailors leave, the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain. As she leaves, the Captain remarks that she is "a plump and pleasing person". Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a <a href="Able%20Seaman%20%28rank%29">humble sailor</a> in his crew, but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor.

Sir Joseph comes on board, accompanied by his "admiring crowd of sisters, cousins and aunts". He recounts how he rose from humble beginnings to be "ruler of the Queen's Navee" through persistence, although he has no naval qualifications. He then delivers a humiliating lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say "if you please" after giving an order; for "A British sailor is any man's equal" – excepting Sir Joseph's. Sir Joseph has composed a song to illustrate that point, and he gives a copy of it to Ralph. Shortly afterwards, elated by Sir Joseph's views on equality, Ralph decides that he will declare his love to Josephine. This delights his shipmates, except Dick Deadeye, who contends that "when people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question". Shocked by his words, the other sailors force Dick to listen to Sir Joseph's song before they exit, leaving Ralph alone on deck. Josephine now enters, and Ralph confesses his love in terms surprisingly eloquent for a "common sailor". Josephine is touched, but although she has found Sir Joseph's attentions nauseating, she knows that it is her duty to marry Sir Joseph instead of Ralph. Disguising her true feelings, she "haughtily rejects" Ralph's "proffered love".

Ralph summons his shipmates (Sir Joseph's female relatives also arrive) and tells them that he is bent on suicide. The crew expresses sympathy, except for Dick, who provides a stark counterpoint of dissent. Ralph puts a pistol to his head, but as he is about to pull the trigger, Josephine enters, admitting that she loves him after all. Ralph and Josephine plan to sneak ashore to elope that night. Dick Deadeye warns them to "forbear, nor carry out the scheme", but the joyous ship's company ignores him.

Later that night, under a full moon, Captain Corcoran reviews his concerns: his "kindly crew rebels", his "daughter to a <a href="Jack%20Tar">tar</a> is partial", his friends seem to desert him, and Sir Joseph has threatened a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>. Little Buttercup offers sympathy. He tells her that, if it were not for the difference in their social standing, he would have returned her affection. She prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that "a change" is in store for him, but he does not understand her cryptic warning.

Sir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his "exalted rank" and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that "love levels all ranks", she will accept his proposal. They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury. When Sir Joseph makes the argument that "love levels all ranks", a delighted Josephine says that she "will hesitate no longer". The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph.

Dick Deadeye intercepts the Captain and tells him of the lovers' plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love, justifying their actions because "He is an Englishman!" The furious Captain is unmoved and blurts out, "Why, damme, it's too bad!" Sir Joseph and his relatives, who have overheard this oath, are shocked to hear swearing on board a ship, and Sir Joseph orders the Captain confined to his cabin.

When Sir Joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer's outburst, Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine. Furious in his turn at this revelation, and ignoring Josephine's plea to spare Ralph, Sir Joseph has the sailor "loaded with chains" and taken to the ship's brig. Little Buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long-held secret. Many years ago, when she "practised <a href="baby%20farming">baby-farming</a>", she had cared for two babies, one "of low condition", the other "a regular <a href="Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29">patrician</a>". She confesses that she "mixed those children up. ... The wellborn babe was Ralph; your Captain was the other."

Sir Joseph now realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph. He summons both, and they emerge wearing each other's uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the "Pinafore", and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now "out of the question" in his eyes: "love levels all ranks ... to a considerable extent, but it does not level them as much as that." He hands her to Captain Rackstraw. The former Captain's now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing.

"Pinafore" opened on 25 May 1878 at the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a>, before an enthusiastic audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves in the summer of 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a>.

In late August 1878, Sullivan used some of the "Pinafore" music, arranged by his assistant <a href="Hamilton%20Clarke">Hamilton Clarke</a>, during several successful promenade concerts at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales. By September, "Pinafore" was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique. The piano score sold 10,000 copies, and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.

Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the financial resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of the Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present "Pinafore" for the duration of the initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when "Pinafore" resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.

Meanwhile, numerous versions of "Pinafore", unauthorised by its creators, began playing in America with great success, beginning with a production in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> that opened on 25 November 1878. "Pinafore" became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the exchange:

<poem style="margin-left: 2em;">"What, never?"
"No, never!"
"What, "never?""
"Well, hardly ever!"</poem>
In February 1879, "Pinafore" resumed operations at the Opera Comique. The opera also resumed touring in April, with two companies crisscrossing the British provinces by June, one starring <a href="Richard%20Mansfield">Richard Mansfield</a> as Sir Joseph, the other <a href="W.%20S.%20Penley">W. S. Penley</a> in the role. Hoping to join in on the profits to be made in America from "Pinafore", Carte left in June for New York to make arrangements for an "authentic" production there to be rehearsed personally by the author and composer. He arranged to rent a theatre and auditioned chorus members for the American production of "Pinafore" and a new Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be premiered in New York, and for tours.

Sullivan, as had been arranged with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce "Pinafore" with them and that he would be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July. In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play "Pinafore" at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of "Pinafore" more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Aeneas Joseph Dymott, accepted. They engaged the <a href="Imperial%20Theatre%2C%20London">Imperial Theatre</a> but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique. Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although the stage manager, Richard Barker, and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted "Fire!" George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. Gilbert sued to stop the Comedy Opera Company from staging their rival production of "H.M.S. Pinafore". The court permitted the production to go on at the Imperial, beginning on 1 August 1879, and it transferred to the <a href="Olympic%20Theatre">Olympic Theatre</a> in September. <a href="Pauline%20Rita">Pauline Rita</a> was one of a series of Josephines. The production received good notices and initially sold well but was withdrawn in October after 91 performances. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte's favour about two years later.

After his return to London, Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows. Meanwhile, "Pinafore" continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, "Pinafore" completed its initial run of 571 performances. Only one other work of <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a> in the world had ever run longer, <a href="Robert%20Planquette">Robert Planquette</a>'s <a href="operetta">operetta</a> "<a href="Les%20cloches%20de%20Corneville">Les cloches de Corneville</a>".

Approximately 150 unauthorised productions of "Pinafore" sprang up in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in 1878 and 1879, and none of these paid royalties to the authors. Gilbert and Sullivan called them "pirated", although the creators did not have any international copyright protection. The first of these productions, opening at the Boston Museum on 25 November 1878, made such a splash that the piece was quickly produced in major cities and on tour by dozens of companies throughout the country. Boston alone saw at least a dozen productions, including a juvenile version described by <a href="Louisa%20May%20Alcott">Louisa May Alcott</a> in her 1879 story, "Jimmy's Cruise in the Pinafore". In New York, different productions of the piece played simultaneously in eight theatres within five blocks of each other and in six theatres in Philadelphia.
These unauthorised performances took many forms, including <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesques</a>, productions with men playing women's roles and vice versa, spoofs, variety acts, <a href="Minstrel%20show">Minstrel show</a> versions, all-black and Catholic productions, German, <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> and other foreign-language versions, performances on boats or by church choirs, and productions starring casts of children. Few purported to play the opera as written. Sheet music arrangements were popular, there were "Pinafore"-themed dolls and household items, and references to the opera were common in advertising, news and other media. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, or at least to claim some royalties, without success. They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after "Pinafore", "<a href="The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a>", by giving the official premiere in New York.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of "Pinafore" in America. Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager <a href="John%20T.%20Ford">John T. Ford</a> to present, at the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20Theatre">Fifth Avenue Theatre</a>, the first authorised American production of "Pinafore". In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including <a href="J.%20H.%20Ryley">J. H. Ryley</a> as Sir Joseph, <a href="Blanche%20Roosevelt">Blanche Roosevelt</a> as Josephine, <a href="Alice%20Barnett">Alice Barnett</a> as Little Buttercup, <a href="Furneaux%20Cook">Furneaux Cook</a> as Dick Deadeye, <a href="Hugh%20Talbot">Hugh Talbot</a> as Ralph Rackstraw and <a href="Jessie%20Bond">Jessie Bond</a> as Cousin Hebe. To these, he added some American singers, including <a href="Signor%20Brocolini">Signor Brocolini</a> as Captain Corcoran. <a href="Alfred%20Cellier">Alfred Cellier</a> came to assist Sullivan, while his brother <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cellier">François</a> remained in London to conduct "Pinafore" there.

"Pinafore" opened in New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of "Pinafore". This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, "The Pirates of Penzance", which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing "Pinafore" alongside "Pirates".

The unauthorised juvenile productions of "Pinafore" were so popular that Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cellier">François Cellier</a>, who had taken over from his brother as Carte's music director in London, adapted the score for children's voices. Between its two Christmas seasons in London, the children's production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880.

Carte's children's production earned enthusiastic reviews from the critic <a href="Clement%20Scott">Clement Scott</a> and the other London critics, as well as the audiences, including children. However, Captain Corcoran's curse "Damme!" was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>, who later wrote: "a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus 'He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning ... How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".

After the opera became successful in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as many as three, played "Pinafore" under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a> had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.
Until 1908, revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress, with ladies' costumes executed by couture houses such as <a href="Redfern%20%28couture%29">Redfern</a>. After that, designers such as <a href="Percy%20Anderson">Percy Anderson</a>, <a href="George%20Sheringham">George Sheringham</a> and <a href="Peter%20Goffin">Peter Goffin</a> created Victorian costume designs. The 1887 set was designed by <a href="Hawes%20Craven">Hawes Craven</a>. In the winter of 1940–41, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's scenery and costumes for "Pinafore" and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The opera was revived in London in the summer of 1947. It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company's closure in 1982. The D'Oyly Carte company performed "Pinafore" before <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and the royal family at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> on 16 June 1977, during the queen's Silver Jubilee year, the first <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">royal command performance</a> of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.

The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not allow any other professional company to present the Savoy operas in Britain until the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so, beginning in the 19th century. After 1961, other professional companies mounted productions of the opera in Britain. These have included <a href="Tyrone%20Guthrie">Tyrone Guthrie</a>'s 1960 production from <a href="Stratford%20Shakespeare%20Festival">Stratford, Ontario</a>, seen on Broadway in 1960 and in London in 1962 and a New Sadler's Wells Opera Company production first seen on 4 June 1984 at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a>, which was seen also in New York. <a href="Scottish%20Opera">Scottish Opera</a>, <a href="Welsh%20National%20Opera">Welsh National Opera</a> and many of the other British opera companies have mounted productions, as did the reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1990 and its closure in 2003. In recent years, the <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa Opera Company</a> has produced "Pinafore" several times, including in 2009, and <a href="Opera%20della%20Luna">Opera della Luna</a> and other British companies continue to mount the piece.

The extraordinary initial success of "Pinafore" in America was seen first-hand by <a href="J.%20C.%20Williamson">J. C. Williamson</a>. He soon made arrangements with D'Oyly Carte to present the opera's first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The <a href="Internet%20Broadway%20Database">Internet Broadway Database</a> links to a non-exhaustive list of 29 productions on Broadway alone. Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present "Pinafore" regularly in the U.S. are <a href="Opera%20a%20la%20Carte%20%28US%29">Opera a la Carte</a>, based in California, <a href="Ohio%20Light%20Opera">Ohio Light Opera</a> and the <a href="New%20York%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Players">New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players</a>, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons. "Pinafore" is still performed around the world by opera companies such as the Royal Theatre, <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>; Australian Opera (and <a href="Essgee%20Entertainment">Essgee Entertainment</a> and others in Australia); in <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, Germany; and even <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>, Uzbekistan.

The following table shows the history of the D'Oyly Carte productions (excluding tours) in Gilbert's lifetime:

The early reviews were mostly favourable. "<a href="The%20Era%20%28newspaper%29">The Era</a>" wrote:
"The Era" also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine. "The Entr'acte and Limelight" commented that the opera was reminiscent of "Trial by Jury" and "Sorcerer" but found it diverting and called the music "very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics, is funny". The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph, noting with amusement that he was made up to look like portraits of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, "and his good introductory song seems levelled at" <a href="William%20Henry%20Smith%20%281825%E2%80%931891%29">W. H. Smith</a>. It opined, further, that "He Is an Englishman" is "an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English". It found the piece, as a whole, well presented and predicted that it would have a long run.
Similarly, "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" concluded that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's "caustic humour and quaint satire". It found that there was "much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits. ... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expression ... The piece is well performed throughout." The "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">Daily News</a>", "The Globe", "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and "<a href="Evening%20Standard">The Standard</a>" concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, "adds to the reality of the illusion". "The Times" also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a "national musical stage" with a libretto free from risqué French "improprieties" and without the "aid" of Italian and German musical models.

"<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and the "<a href="Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">Athenaeum</a>", however, greeted the opera with only mixed praise. "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was "detrimental to the art-progress of either" because, although it was popular with audiences, "something higher is demanded for what is understood as 'comic opera'". The paper commented that Sullivan had "the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition". It concluded, however, by saying how much it enjoyed the opera: "Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that "H.M.S. Pinafore" is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end". "The Times" and several of the other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art. Only "The Figaro" was actively hostile to the new piece. Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by "The Academy" joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for "Pinafore" and hoped that he would turn to projects "more worthy of his great ability". This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.

The many unauthorised American productions of 1878–79 were of widely varying quality, and many of them were adaptations of the opera. One of the more "authentic" ones was the production by the <a href="Boston%20Ideal%20Opera%20Company">Boston Ideal Opera Company</a>, which was first formed to produce "Pinafore". It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an "ideal" production. The "Boston Journal" reported that the audience was "wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval". The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider "Pinafore" a burlesque, "for while irresistibly comical it is not "bouffe" and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost". The "Journal" described the opera as "classical" in method and wrote that its "most exquisite satire" lay in its "imitation of the absurdities" of grand opera. The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America. The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" wrote that "the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight ... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard".

When "Pinafore" was first revived in London in 1887, it was already treated as a classic. "The Illustrated London News" observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue, jokes and songs, but concluded that this was for the best, as the public would have missed the "time-honoured jokes, such as 'Hardly Ever.' The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success." "The Theatre" concurred, stating that since the opera "has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere, there is not much occasion to descant". It called the revival a "most brilliant" success and predicted another long run.
Reviewing the 1899 revival, "<a href="Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>" managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's critique of Sullivan. On the one hand, "The "Pinafore" ... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character ... it is delicately scored, and in many ways displays ability of a high order". On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his <a href="Symphony%20in%20E%2C%20Irish">symphony</a>, "he would have produced still higher results; in like manner "Pinafore" set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts".

In 1911, <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> wrote: "No other comic opera ever written – no other stage play, indeed, of any sort – was ever so popular. ... "Pinafore" ... has been given, and with great success, wherever there are theaters – from Moscow to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, from <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>; in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>; even in Paris, Rome, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>." After the deaths of Gilbert and Sullivan, the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a> retained exclusive rights to perform their operas in Great Britain until 1962, touring throughout Britain for most of the year and, beginning in 1919, often performing in London for a season of about four months. "The Times" gave the company's 1920 London production an enthusiastic review, saying that the audience was "enraptured", and regretting that "Pinafore" would be played for only two weeks. It praised the cast, singling out <a href="Leo%20Sheffield">Leo Sheffield</a> as the Captain, <a href="Henry%20Lytton">Henry Lytton</a> as Sir Joseph, <a href="Elsie%20Griffin">Elsie Griffin</a> as Josephine, James Hay as Ralph, <a href="Bertha%20Lewis">Bertha Lewis</a> as Little Buttercup and the "splendid" choral tone. It concluded that the opera made a "rollicking climax to the season". Two years later, it gave an even more glowing report of that season's performances, calling <a href="Derek%20Oldham">Derek Oldham</a> an "ideal hero" as Ralph, noting that <a href="Sydney%20Granville">Sydney Granville</a> "fairly brought down the house" with his song, that <a href="Darrell%20Fancourt">Darrell Fancourt</a>'s Deadeye was "an admirably sustained piece of caricature" and that it was a "great pleasure" to hear the returning principals. A 1961 review of the company's "Pinafore" is much the same.

In 1879, <a href="J.%20C.%20Williamson">J. C. Williamson</a> acquired the exclusive performing rights to "Pinafore" in Australia and New Zealand. His first production earned public and critical acclaim. Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, <a href="Maggie%20Moore">Maggie Moore</a> played Josephine. Praising the production and all the performers, the "Sydney Morning Herald" noted that the production though "abounding in fun" was dignified and precise, that many numbers were encored and that laughter and applause from the "immense audience ... was liberally bestowed". Williamson's company continued to produce "Pinafore" in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success. As Williamson said, "If you need money, then put on G&S". Meanwhile, "Pinafore" continued to garner praise outside Britain. The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen, for example, was revived repeatedly, playing for well over 100 performances to "packed houses". Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> in Uzbekistan have been successful.

In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan's performance copyright was never in force, "Pinafore" continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies. "The New York Times", in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat <a href="New%20York%20Hippodrome">New York Hippodrome</a> a "royal entertainment [that] comes up smiling". The opera had been turned into a "mammoth spectacle" with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour. Buttercup made her entrance by rowing over to the three-masted "Pinafore", and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash. The "Times" praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs to be "shouted". The production took some liberties, including interpolated music from other Sullivan works. The paper concluded, "the mild satire of "Pinafore" is entertaining because it is universal". The same newspaper deemed <a href="Winthrop%20Ames">Winthrop Ames</a>' popular Broadway productions of "Pinafore" in the 1920s and 1930s "spectacular". Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received. "The New York Times" review of <a href="The%20New%20York%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Players">The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players</a>' 2008 season at <a href="New%20York%20City%20Center">New York City Center</a> commented, "Gilbert's themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated. But the lasting appeal of "Pinafore" and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan's generous supply of addictive melodies."

With the expiry of the copyrights, companies around the world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. Productions of "Pinafore", both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful <a href="Essgee%20Entertainment">Essgee Entertainment</a> (formed by <a href="Simon%20Gallaher">Simon Gallaher</a>) in Australia and <a href="Opera%20della%20Luna">Opera della Luna</a> in Britain. Since its original production, "H.M.S. Pinafore" has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers around the world. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of "Pinafore", "Pirates" and "Mikado". This does not take into account other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of "Pinafore" are presented every year worldwide.

Theatre historian <a href="John%20Bush%20Jones">John Bush Jones</a> wrote that "Pinafore" has "everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [and] has a score that ... has plenty of tunes for the audience to go away humming". Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that the secret of the success of the Savoy operas is the way in which "Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment." Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on "mirth and silliness". Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a <a href="pinafore">pinafore</a>, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like "<a href="HMS%20Victory">Victory</a>", "<a href="HMS%20Goliath">Goliath</a>", "<a href="HMS%20Audacious">Audacious</a>" and "<a href="HMS%20Minotaur">Minotaur</a>".

Gilbert's biographer Jane Stedman wrote that "Pinafore" is "satirically far more complex" than "The Sorcerer". She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from "Captain Reece" (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from "General John" (1867). Dick Deadeye, based on a character in "Woman's Gratitude" (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding "face and form" makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense. Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, "<a href="The%20Gentleman%20in%20Black">The Gentleman in Black</a>" which includes the device of baby-switching.
Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that "Pinafore" "satirizes the type of nautical drama of which <a href="Douglas%20Jerrold">Douglas Jerrold</a>'s "<a href="Black-Eyed%20Susan">Black-Eyed Susan</a>" is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or nothing to help one's country". <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of "being proud of yourself for being a citizen" of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the "temptations to belong to other nations" but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military ... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole <a href="jingoism">jingoism</a> that is the British Empire." In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: ""H.M.S. Pinafore" is basically a satire on ... the British love of the class system. ... [O]f course [Ralph] can marry [the Captain's] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'". Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's "patriotism guarantees his virtue".

One of Gilbert's favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility. In "<a href="The%20Happy%20Land">The Happy Land</a>" (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In "Pinafore", Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by "never go[ing] to sea". In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in "Pirates", and Ko-Ko in "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>", are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph "always voted at [his] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity. The "commercial middle class" (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed. In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in "<a href="The%20Bohemian%20Girl">The Bohemian Girl</a>". "The Times" wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that "Pinafore" was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a "paternal" Captain and the "ethics ... of all romanticism" are accepted "unflinchingly" and taken to their logical conclusion: "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out".
A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks. In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, "The Sorcerer", a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different <a href="social%20class">social class</a>es. In "Pinafore", the captain's daughter, Josephine, loves and is loved by a common sailor, but she dutifully tells him, "your proffered love I haughtily reject". He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with "I am a British sailor, and I love you". It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she. This is a parody of the Victorian "equality" drama, such as <a href="Edward%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lady%20of%20Lyons">The Lady of Lyons</a>" (1838), where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech, ending with "I am a peasant!" It then turns out that he has become her social superior. Furthermore, in "Pinafore", Sir Joseph assures Josephine that "love levels all ranks". In <a href="Tom%20Taylor">Tom Taylor</a>'s "The Serf", the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank, and she declares happily at the end that "love levels all". In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are "any man's equal" (excepting his), and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor. Conversely, he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him "dance a hornpipe on the cabin table". Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine "becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of Buttercup's inadvertent switching of the infants" and concludes that Gilbert is a "conservative satirist [who] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [and] set out to show [that] love definitely "does not" level all ranks".

There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is, as Jones argues, a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest "against the follies of his age". The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert's "techniques of inversion – with irony and topsyturvydom", which lead to "the surface meaning of his writings" being "the opposite of their underlying meaning". Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to "celebrate" society's norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions. In "Pinafore", which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that "also had tremendous appeal to the general public". He creates "a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama ... [though] controlled by the conventions it mocks". While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in "Pinafore" Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself. The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain's daughter, throwing over the accepted "fabric of social order". At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert's satiric argument should result in Ralph's arrest. But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies. By an "accident of birth", Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once. Crowther concludes, "We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule." Thus, "Pinafore" found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the "existing social order" and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.

According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot "admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius". Sullivan embraces the nautical setting; in "We Sail the Ocean Blue", for example, he "presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty". In the Captain's opening song, "I am the Captain of the Pinafore", he admits that his gentlemanliness "never ... well, hardly ever" gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he "hardly ever" suffers from seasickness. Sullivan "unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase 'What never?' ... cunningly sharpened ... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon." Audrey Williamson argued that the music of "Pinafore" is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score, from the "glee" for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to "For He Is an Englishman".
The best-known songs from the opera include "I'm called Little Buttercup", a <a href="waltz">waltz</a> tune introducing the character, which Sullivan repeats in the entr'acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience; and "A British tar" (a <a href="glee%20%28music%29">glee</a> for three men describing the ideal sailor), composed by Sir Joseph "to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man's equal, excepting mine". Sullivan's voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the "equality" plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph. Another popular number is Sir Joseph's song "When I was a Lad", recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of <a href="William%20Henry%20Smith%20%281825%E2%80%931891%29">W. H. Smith</a>, the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877.

In "Pinafore", Sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect, for instance in "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes "a rousing nautical tune ... in a key of no nonsense, C major ... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of "Sorry her lot" in 2/4 [time]. After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup ... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." He continues, "the bassoon and basses ... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore ... in the improbable key of A flat minor. ... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a <a href="Cadential%20six%20four">good old 6/4</a>".

According to Jacobs, "Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their interactive music (particularly 'Never mind the why and wherefore'), and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama, Little Buttercup with 'gypsy blood in her veins' and the heavy-treading Dick Deadeye." Jacobs also opined that the <a href="Leading-tone">leading tone</a> that begins "Never mind the why and wherefore" "serves to emphasize the phrase like a <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss-ian</a> grace-note". The Sullivan scholar <a href="David%20Russell%20Hulme">David Russell Hulme</a> noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, "particularly the <a href="Handel">Handel</a>ian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'" Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>'s "<a href="Der%20Erlk%C3%B6nig">The Erl-King</a>" and also parodies the opera "<a href="Il%20Trovatore">Il Trovatore</a>". Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in "<a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizettian</a> recitative". But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by "subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings."

During rehearsals for the original production, Gilbert added a ballad for Captain Corcoran in which he urged his daughter to forget the common sailor with whom she is in love, because "at every step, he would commit solecisms that society would never pardon." The ballad was meant to be sung between No. 5 and No. 6 of the current score, but it was cut before opening night. The words survive in the libretto that was deposited with the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a> for licensing. Before 1999, all that was known to survive of Sullivan's setting was a copy of the leader violin part.

In April 1999, Sullivan scholars Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry announced that they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed a number of times by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.

In the licensing copy of the libretto, Sir Joseph's cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II. In the scene that follows No. 14 ("Things are seldom what they seem"), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord's dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet, eliciting the response "Crushed again!" Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in "<a href="Patience%20%28opera%29">Patience</a>". Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 ("Carefully on tiptoe stealing") and again after No. 19 ("Farewell, my own").

Late in rehearsals for the original production, Jessie Bond assumed the role of Hebe, replacing <a href="Mrs%20Howard%20Paul">Mrs Howard Paul</a>. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.

The dialogue preceding the Act II finale, starting with "Here, take her sir, and mind you treat her kindly", was originally recitative. The music for this passage was printed in the first edition of the vocal score as No. 20a. Shortly after opening night, the recitative was dropped, and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue. In modern productions, the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue.

There have been numerous recordings of "Pinafore" since 1907. <a href="Ian%20Bradley">Ian Bradley</a> counted seventeen recordings of the opera available on CD in 2005.

The 1930 recording is notable for preserving the performances of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company stars of the era. The 1960 D'Oyly Carte recording, which contains all the dialogue, has been repeatedly praised by reviewers. The 1994 Mackerras recording, featuring grand opera singers in the principal roles, is musically well regarded. The 2000 D'Oyly Carte recording also contains complete dialogue and the first recording of the "lost" ballad for Captain Corcoran, "Reflect, my child", as a bonus track. A 1957 Danish-language recording of the opera is one of the few foreign-language professional recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan.

In 1939, "Pinafore" was chosen by NBC as one of the earliest operas ever broadcast on American television, but no recording is known to have been saved. The 1973 D'Oyly Carte video recording, directed by <a href="Michael%20Heyland">Michael Heyland</a>, features the company's staging of the period, but some reviewers find it dull. It is, however, one of only three video or film recordings of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. In 1982, Brent Walker Productions produced "Pinafore" as part of its series of Gilbert and Sullivan television films. According to discographer Marc Shepherd, the "Pinafore" video "is widely considered one of the worst" in the series. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the <a href="International%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Festival">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</a>.


"H.M.S. Pinafore" has been adapted many times. W. S. Gilbert wrote a 1909 children's book called "The Pinafore Picture Book", illustrated by <a href="Alice%20B.%20Woodward">Alice Woodward</a>, which retells the story of "Pinafore", in some cases giving considerable backstory that is not found in the libretto. Many other children's books have since been written retelling the story of "Pinafore" or adapting characters or events from "Pinafore".

Many musical theatre adaptations have been produced since the original opera. Notable examples include a 1945 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical adapted by <a href="George%20S.%20Kaufman">George S. Kaufman</a>, called "<a href="Hollywood%20Pinafore">Hollywood Pinafore</a>", using Sullivan's music. This was revived several times, including in London in 1998. Another 1945 Broadway musical adaptation, "<a href="Memphis%20Bound">Memphis Bound</a>", was written by <a href="Don%20Walker%20%28orchestrator%29">Don Walker</a> and starred <a href="Bill%20Robinson">Bill Robinson</a> and an all-black cast. In 1940, the American Negro Light Opera Association produced the first of several productions set in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, "Tropical Pinafore". An early <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> adaptation of "Pinafore", called "Der Shirtz" (Yiddish for "apron") was written by Miriam Walowit in 1952 for a <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a> <a href="Hadassah">Hadassah</a> group, and they recorded 12 of the songs. In the 1970s, Al Grand was inspired by this recording and urged the Gilbert and Sullivan Long Island Light Opera Company to perform these songs. He later translated the missing songs and dialogue, with Bob Tartell, and the show has been toured widely under the name "Der Yiddisher Pinafore". The group have continued to produce this adaptation for over two decades, in which "He is an Englishman" becomes "Er Iz a Guter Yid" ("He is a good Jew").

<a href="Essgee%20Entertainment">Essgee Entertainment</a> produced an adapted version of "Pinafore" in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand that has been much revived. Another musical adaptation is "Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical)", adapted by <a href="Mark%20Savage%20%28American%20playwright%29">Mark Savage</a>. It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a> on 7 September 2001, directed by Savage, where it ran with great success for nine months. It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003. In this adaptation, only one character is female, and all but one of the male characters are gay. An original cast recording was issued in 2002 by Belva Records. "Pinafore Swing" is a musical with music arranged by <a href="Sarah%20Travis">Sarah Travis</a>. It premiered at the <a href="Watermill%20Theatre">Watermill Theatre</a> in England in 2004 in a production directed by <a href="John%20Doyle%20%28director%29">John Doyle</a>. The adaptation, set in 1944, changes the characters into members of a band entertaining the sailors on a <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> troop ship in the Atlantic. The reduced-size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles, and the music is infused with swing rhythms. Numerous productions in recent decades have been set to parody "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" or "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>".

Among its other influences on popular culture, "Pinafore" had perhaps its most profound influence on the <a href="development%20of%20musical%20theatre">development of musical theatre</a>. According to theatre historian <a href="John%20Kenrick%20%28theatre%20writer%29">John Kenrick</a>, "Pinafore" "became an international sensation, reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States." The music writer <a href="Andrew%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Andrew Lamb</a> notes, "The success of "H.M.S. Pinafore" in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French opéra bouffe throughout the English-speaking world". The historian John Bush Jones opines that "Pinafore" and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre "can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value" and that "Pinafore" created the model for a new kind of musical theatre, the "integrated" musical, where "book, lyrics, and music combined to form an integral whole". He adds that its "unprecedented ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre, while the show itself became a model for form, content, and even intention of ... musicals ever since, especially socially relevant musicals." Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of "Pinafore" described above, musicals in which the story line involves a production of "Pinafore" and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music. Other examples include "The Pirates of Pinafore", "The Pinafore Pirates" (which Bradley calls "splendid" and describes in detail in Bradley (2005), pp. 174–75), <a href="http%3A//www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/myshows/page24/mutiny.html">"Mutiny on the Pinafore"</a>, and <a href="https%3A//archive.li/20040604134138/http%3A//home.att.net/%7Ecoriolan/musical/hmsdumbledore.htm">"H.M.S. Dumbledore"</a> (2004) by Caius Marcius.</ref> The first such parody was a short-lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882, called "The Wreck of the Pinafore" by H. Lingard and <a href="Luscombe%20Searelle">Luscombe Searelle</a>; the opera's characters are shipwrecked on a desert island. It was described by "The Era" as "chiefly remarkable for its impudence".

The opera's popularity has led to the widespread parody and <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of its songs in comedy routines, literature and other media. Many comedians have used "Pinafore" songs for comic and satiric effect. For example, in his comedy album "<a href="My%20Son%2C%20the%20Celebrity">My Son, the Celebrity</a>", <a href="Allan%20Sherman">Allan Sherman</a> parodies "When I Was a Lad" from the point of view of a young man who goes to an <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> school and then rises to prominence in business. At the end of the song, he "thanks <a href="Yale%20University">old Yale</a>", "thanks the Lord" and thanks his father, "who is chairman of the board". Literary references to "Pinafore" songs include Harris's attempt to sing "When I Was a Lad" in <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Men%20in%20a%20Boat">Three Men in a Boat</a>". Another is found in the story "<a href="Runaround%20%28story%29">Runaround</a>" from "<a href="I%2C%20Robot">I, Robot</a>" by <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, where a robot sings part of "I'm Called Little Buttercup". "Pinafore" and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as <a href="Todd%20Rundgren">Todd Rundgren</a>, <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a> and Michele Gray Rundgren, who performed "Never Mind the Why and Wherefore" on "Night Music" ("<a href="Sunday%20Night%20%28American%20TV%20program%29">Sunday Night</a>") in 1989.

Political references include a 1996 satiric pastiche of "When I Was a Lad" aimed at <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> by <a href="Virginia%20Bottomley">Virginia Bottomley</a>, heritage secretary under <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>. Sporting references include a racehorse named "H.M.S. Pinafore". "Pinafore" songs and images have been used extensively in advertising. According to Jones, ""Pinafore" launched the first media blitz in the United States" beginning in 1879, and recent ads include a television campaign for <a href="Terry%27s%20Chocolate%20Orange">Terry's Chocolate Orange</a> featuring a pastiche of "When I Was a Lad". "Pinafore"-themed merchandise includes trading cards that were created in the 1880s.

Songs from "Pinafore" have been used to give period flavor to such films as the 1981 historical film "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>", in which the protagonist, <a href="Harold%20Abrahams">Harold Abrahams</a>, and others from <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, sing "He Is an Englishman". This song also features at the end of the 1983 BBC drama "<a href="An%20Englishman%20Abroad">An Englishman Abroad</a>". In the 2003 movie "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%282003%20film%29">Peter Pan</a>", the Darling family sings "When I Was a Lad". In "<a href="Wyatt%20Earp%20%28film%29">Wyatt Earp</a>" (1994), the famed lawman meets his future wife when he sees her playing in an early production of "Pinafore". A 1953 biopic, "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan</a>", uses music from "Pinafore".

Characters also sing songs from "Pinafore" in such popular films as "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>" (1981) and "" (1998), where <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Captain Picard</a> and <a href="Worf">Lt. Commander Worf</a> sing part of "A British Tar" to distract a malfunctioning <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Lt. Commander Data</a>. "<a href="The%20Good%20Shepherd%20%28film%29">The Good Shepherd</a>" (2006) depicts an all-male version of "Pinafore" at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in 1939; <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a>s character plays Little Buttercup, singing in <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a>. <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> sings "I Am the Monarch of the Sea" in the 1963 film, "<a href="I%20Could%20Go%20On%20Singing">I Could Go On Singing</a>". The soundtrack of the 1992 thriller "<a href="The%20Hand%20That%20Rocks%20the%20Cradle%20%28film%29">The Hand that Rocks the Cradle</a>" prominently features songs and music from "Pinafore", and the father and daughter characters sing "I Am the Captain of the Pinafore" together. An example of a film based on ideas from "Pinafore" is the 1976 animated film by <a href="Ronald%20Searle">Ronald Searle</a> called "<a href="Dick%20Deadeye%2C%20or%20Duty%20Done">Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done</a>" is based on the character and songs from "Pinafore". In the 1988 drama "<a href="Permanent%20Record%20%28film%29">Permanent Record</a>", a high school class performs "Pinafore".

Television series that include substantial "Pinafore" references include "<a href="The%20West%20Wing%20%28TV%20series%29">The West Wing</a>", for example in the 2000 episode "<a href="And%20It%27s%20Surely%20to%20Their%20Credit">And It's Surely to Their Credit</a>", where "He Is an Englishman" is used throughout and quoted (or paraphrased) in the episode's title. Among other notable examples of the use of songs from "Pinafore" on television are several popular animated shows. In the "<a href="Cape%20Feare">Cape Feare</a>" episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a> stalls his would-be killer <a href="Sideshow%20Bob">Sideshow Bob</a> with a "final request" that Bob sing him the entire score of "Pinafore". Similarly, the 1993 "HMS Yakko" episode of "<a href="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a>" consists of pastiches of songs from "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Pirates of Penzance". In a "<a href="Family%20Guy">Family Guy</a>" episode, "<a href="The%20Thin%20White%20Line">The Thin White Line</a>" (2001), <a href="Stewie%20Griffin">Stewie</a> sings a pastiche of "My Gallant Crew".

Huntington's disease

Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is an <a href="inherited%20disorder">inherited disorder</a> that <a href="neurodegenerative%20disease">results in death of brain cells</a>. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady <a href="gait">gait</a> often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>. People with HD often <a href="anosognosia">underestimate the degree of their problems</a>.
HD is typically <a href="genetic%20disorder">inherited</a>, although up to 10% of cases are due to a new <a href="mutation">mutation</a>. The disease is caused by an <a href="autosomal%20dominant">autosomal dominant</a> mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a <a href="gene">gene</a> called "<a href="Huntingtin">Huntingtin</a>". This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The "Huntingtin" gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called "huntingtin". Expansion of CAG (<a href="cytosine">cytosine</a>-<a href="adenine">adenine</a>-<a href="guanine">guanine</a>) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by <a href="genetic%20testing">genetic testing</a>, which can be carried out at any time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.
There is no cure for HD. Full-time care is required in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with <a href="tetrabenazine">tetrabenazine</a>. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. <a href="Suicide">Suicide</a> is the cause of death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.
The first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by the physician <a href="George%20Huntington">George Huntington</a>, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the <a href="Hereditary%20Disease%20Foundation">Hereditary Disease Foundation</a>. Research and <a href="Support%20group">support</a> organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving <a href="animal%20models">animal models</a> to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as <a href="Stem%20cell%20treatments">stem cell therapy</a> with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease.

Symptoms of Huntington's disease most commonly become noticeable between the ages of 35 and 44 years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, <a href="cognition">cognition</a>, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.

The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called <a href="Choreia%20%28disease%29">chorea</a>. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed <a href="Saccade">saccadic eye movements</a>. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or <a href="dystonia">abnormal posturing</a> appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected. <a href="Psychomotor%20retardation">Psychomotor</a> functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, <a href="Dysphagia">swallowing</a>, and <a href="Dysarthria">speaking</a>. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. <a href="Sleep%20disorder">Sleep disturbances</a> are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. <a href="Seizure">Seizure</a>s are also a common symptom of this form of HD.

Cognitive abilities are progressively impaired. Especially affected are <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a>, which include planning, cognitive flexibility, <a href="abstract%20thinking">abstract thinking</a>, rule acquisition, initiation of appropriate actions, and inhibition of inappropriate actions. As the disease progresses, <a href="memory">memory</a> deficits tend to appear. Reported impairments range from <a href="short-term%20memory">short-term memory</a> deficits to <a href="long-term%20memory">long-term memory</a> difficulties, including deficits in <a href="episodic%20memory">episodic</a> (memory of one's life), <a href="procedural%20memory">procedural</a> (memory of the body of how to perform an activity) and <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>. Cognitive problems tend to worsen over time, ultimately leading to <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. This pattern of deficits has been called a subcortical dementia syndrome to distinguish it from the typical effects of cortical dementias e.g. <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Reported <a href="Neuropsychiatry">neuropsychiatric</a> manifestations are <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>, <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, a reduced display of emotions (<a href="blunted%20affect">blunted affect</a>), <a href="egocentrism">egocentrism</a>, <a href="aggression">aggression</a>, and <a href="compulsive%20behavior">compulsive behavior</a>, the latter of which can cause or worsen <a href="Behavioral%20addiction">addictions</a>, including <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, <a href="gambling">gambling</a>, and <a href="hypersexuality">hypersexuality</a>. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of <a href="Mental%20illness">psychiatric disorders</a> between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms are among the most distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for <a href="Institutionalisation">institutionalization</a>. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.

Mutant Huntingtin is expressed throughout the body and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include <a href="muscle%20atrophy">muscle atrophy</a>, <a href="cardiac%20failure">cardiac failure</a>, <a href="impaired%20glucose%20tolerance">impaired glucose tolerance</a>, <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a>, <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, and <a href="testicular%20atrophy">testicular atrophy</a>.

All humans have two copies of the <a href="Huntingtin">Huntingtin</a> gene ("HTT"), which codes for the <a href="protein">protein</a> <a href="Huntingtin%23Protein">Huntingtin</a> (HTT). The gene is also called "HD" and "IT15", which stands for 'interesting <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcript</a> 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a <a href="trinucleotide%20repeat%20disorder">trinucleotide repeat</a>, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully <a href="penetrance">penetrant</a>: mutation of either of a person's "HTT" alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but the length of the repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.

HD is one of several <a href="trinucleotide%20repeat%20disorder">trinucleotide repeat disorder</a>s which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The "HTT" gene is located on the <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">short arm</a> of <a href="chromosome%204%20%28human%29">chromosome 4</a> at 4p16.3. "HTT" contains a sequence of three <a href="DNA%20base">DNA base</a>s—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e. ... CAGCAGCAG ...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the 3-letter <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> (<a href="codon">codon</a>) for the <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a <a href="polyglutamine%20tract">polyglutamine tract</a> (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the "PolyQ region".

Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the <a href="cytoplasmic">cytoplasmic</a> protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of <a href="medium%20spiny%20neurons">neurons</a>. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.

Huntington's disease has <a href="autosomal%20dominant">autosomal dominant</a> inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant <a href="allele">allele</a>) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.

Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during <a href="DNA%20replication">replication</a>, and this instability increases with the number of repeats present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (<a href="dynamic%20mutation">dynamic mutation</a>s) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat. This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an "intermediate" number of repeats (28–35), or "reduced penetrance" (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD. Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier <a href="age%20of%20onset">age of onset</a> and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic <a href="anticipation%20%28genetics%29">anticipation</a>. Instability is greater in <a href="spermatogenesis">spermatogenesis</a> than <a href="oogenesis">oogenesis</a>; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length. It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a <a href="de%20novo%20mutation">new mutation</a>, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.

In the rare situations where both parents have an expanded HD gene, the risk increases to 75%, and when either parent has two expanded copies, the risk is 100% (all children will be affected). Individuals with <a href="Homozygous">both genes affected</a> are rare. For some time HD was thought to be the only disease for which possession of a second mutated gene did not affect symptoms and progression, but it has since been found that it can affect the <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> and the rate of progression.

The huntingtin protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the <a href="striatum">striatum</a>, but as the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. <a href="DNA%20methylation">DNA methylation</a> also appears to be changed in HD.

HTT is <a href="gene%20expression">expressed</a> in all cells. The highest concentrations are found in the brain and <a href="testes">testes</a>, with moderate amounts in the <a href="liver">liver</a>, <a href="heart">heart</a>, and <a href="lung">lung</a>s. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, <a href="cell%20signaling">cell signaling</a>, and intracellular <a href="Vesicle%20%28biology%29%23Transport%20vesicles">transporting</a>. In animals <a href="Genetically%20modified%20organism">genetically modified</a> to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. <a href="Caspase">Caspase</a>, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an <a href="Apoptosis">anti-apoptotic</a> agent preventing <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a> and controls the production of <a href="brain-derived%20neurotrophic%20factor">brain-derived neurotrophic factor</a>, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during <a href="neurogenesis">neurogenesis</a>. HTT also facilitates <a href="Synaptic%20vesicle">vesicular</a> transport and <a href="synapsis">synaptic transmission</a> and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the <a href="gene%20expression">expression</a> of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, <a href="brain%20cell">brain cell</a> survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. It is thought that the disease is not caused by <a href="haploinsufficiency">inadequate production</a> of HTT, but by an increase in the toxic function of mHTT in the body.

There are multiple cellular changes through which the toxic function of mHTT may manifest and produce the HD pathology. In its mutant (i.e. polyglutamine expanded) form, the protein is more prone to cleavage that creates shorter fragments containing the polyglutamine expansion. These protein fragments have a propensity to undergo <a href="misfolding">misfolding</a> and aggregation, yielding fibrillar aggregates in which non-native polyglutamine β-strands from multiple proteins are bonded together via hydrogen bonds. These aggregates share the same fundamental cross-β <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> architecture seen in other protein deposition diseases. Over time, the aggregates accumulate to form <a href="inclusion%20bodies">inclusion bodies</a> within cells, ultimately interfering with neuron function. Neuronal inclusions run indirect interference. Inclusion bodies have been found in both the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a> and <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>. Inclusion bodies in cells of the brain are one of the earliest pathological changes, and some experiments have found that they can be <a href="neurotoxicity">toxic</a> for the cell, but other experiments have shown that they may form as part of the body's defense mechanism and help protect cells.

Several pathways by which mHTT may cause cell death have been identified. These include: effects on <a href="Chaperone%20%28protein%29">chaperone proteins</a>, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s, which play a role in the <a href="apoptosis">process of removing cells</a>; the <a href="excitotoxicity">toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells</a>; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.

An additional theory that explains another way cell function may be disrupted by HD proposes that damage to mitochondria in striatal cells is of central importance (numerous accounts of mitochondrial metabolism deficiency have been found). Mutant <a href="Huntingtin">Huntingtin</a> protein has been found to play a key role in <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondrial</a> dysfunction. The impairment of mitochondrial <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport</a> can result in higher levels of <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a> and release of <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a>.

The interactions of the altered huntingtin protein with numerous proteins in neurons leads to an increased vulnerability of glutamine, which, in large amounts, has been found to be an <a href="excitotoxin">excitotoxin</a>. Excitotoxins may cause damage to numerous cellular structures. Although glutamine is not found in excessively high amounts, it has been postulated that because of the increased vulnerability, even normal amounts of glutamine can cause excitotoxins to be expressed.

HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas are more vulnerable than others. The most prominent early effects are in a part of the <a href="basal%20ganglia">basal ganglia</a> called the <a href="neostriatum">neostriatum</a>, which is composed of the <a href="caudate%20nucleus">caudate nucleus</a> and <a href="putamen">putamen</a>. Other areas affected include the <a href="substantia%20nigra">substantia nigra</a>, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, the <a href="hippocampus">hippocampus</a>, <a href="purkinje%20cell">purkinje cell</a>s in the <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, lateral tuberal nuclei of the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> and parts of the <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a>. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with <a href="Neural%20pathway">projections</a> towards the external <a href="globus%20pallidus">globus pallidus</a>, with <a href="interneuron">interneuron</a>s and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an <a href="astrogliosis">abnormal increase</a> in <a href="astrocyte">astrocyte</a>s and activation of the brain's immune cells, <a href="microglia">microglia</a>.

The basal ganglia—the part of the brain most prominently affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive <a href="executive%20function">executive system</a> and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).

<a href="CREB-binding%20protein">CREB-binding protein</a> (CBP), a transcriptional coregulator, is essential for cell function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways. Furthermore, the amino acids that form CBP include a strip of 18 glutamines. Thus, the glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on the HTT chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the nucleus.<ref name="urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease – JBC"></ref> Specifically, CBP contains an acetyltransferase domain to which HTT binds through its polyglutamine-containing domain. Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington's disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP. In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington's disease and neurons in general.

<a href="Medical%20diagnosis">Medical diagnosis</a> of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing can be used to confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or <a href="embryo">embryo</a> carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the "HTT" gene that causes the disease. <a href="Genetic%20counseling">Genetic counseling</a> is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.

A <a href="physical%20examination">physical examination</a>, sometimes combined with a <a href="psychological%20examination">psychological examination</a>, can determine whether the onset of the disease has begun. Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the "unified Huntington's disease rating scale", which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. <a href="Medical%20imaging">Medical imaging</a>, such as <a href="computerized%20tomography">computerized tomography</a> (CT) and <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD. <a href="Cerebral%20atrophy">Cerebral atrophy</a> can be seen in the advanced stages of the disease. <a href="Functional%20neuroimaging">Functional neuroimaging</a> techniques, such as <a href="functional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> (fMRI) and <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools, and are not used clinically.

Because HD follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, there is a strong motivation for individuals who are at risk of inheriting it to seek a diagnosis. The <a href="genetic%20test">genetic test</a> for HD consists of a <a href="Genetic%20testing">blood test</a> which counts the numbers of CAG repeats in each of the "HTT" alleles. <a href="Cutoff%20%28reference%20value%29">Cutoffs</a> are given as follows:

Testing before the onset of symptoms is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience <a href="survivor%20guilt">survivor guilt</a> with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. <a href="Genetic%20counseling">Genetic counseling</a> in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.

Counseling and guidelines on the use of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>s. <a href="Predictive%20testing">Presymptomatic testing</a> for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as <a href="polycystic%20kidney">polycystic kidney</a> disease, familial <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> and <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.

<a href="Embryo">Embryo</a>s produced using <a href="in%20vitro%20fertilisation">in vitro fertilization</a> may be genetically tested for HD using <a href="preimplantation%20genetic%20diagnosis">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring "without" revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is compared with that of the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.

It is also possible to obtain a <a href="prenatal%20diagnosis">prenatal diagnosis</a> for an embryo or <a href="fetus">fetus</a> in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through <a href="chorionic%20villus%20sampling">chorionic villus sampling</a>. An <a href="amniocentesis">amniocentesis</a> can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing the expansion of the HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include <a href="termination%20of%20pregnancy">termination of pregnancy</a>, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.

In addition, in at-risk pregnancies due to an affected male partner, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis can be performed by analyzing <a href="cell-free%20fetal%20DNA">cell-free fetal DNA</a> in a blood sample taken from the mother (via <a href="venipuncture">venipuncture</a>) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).

About 99% of HD diagnoses based on the typical symptoms and a <a href="family%20history%20%28medicine%29">family history</a> of the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called <a href="Huntington%27s%20disease-like%20syndrome">HD-like (HDL) syndromes</a>. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the <a href="PRNP">prion protein gene</a> (HDL1), the <a href="JPH3">junctophilin 3 gene</a> (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the <a href="TATA%20binding%20protein">TATA box-binding protein</a> (<a href="Spinocerebellar%20ataxia">SCA17, sometimes called HDL4</a>). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are <a href="dentatorubral-pallidoluysian%20atrophy">dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy</a> and <a href="Adult-onset%20basal%20ganglia%20disease">neuroferritinopathy</a>. There are also <a href="autosomal%20recessive">autosomal recessive</a> disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include <a href="chorea%20acanthocytosis">chorea acanthocytosis</a> and <a href="pantothenate%20kinase-associated%20neurodegeneration">pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration</a>. One <a href="Sex%20linkage">X-linked</a> disorder of this type is <a href="McLeod%20syndrome">McLeod syndrome</a>.

There is no cure for HD, but there are treatments available to reduce the severity of some of its symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed <a href="multidisciplinary">multidisciplinary</a> <a href="caregiving">caregiving</a> becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help <a href="Rehabilitation%20%28neuropsychology%29">rehabilitate</a> cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a>, <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>, and <a href="speech%20therapy">speech therapy</a>. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.

Weight loss and eating difficulties due to <a href="dysphagia">dysphagia</a> and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly important as the disease advances. <a href="Thickening%20agent">Thickening agent</a>s can be added to liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a <a href="percutaneous%20endoscopic%20gastrostomy">percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy</a> is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a> into the stomach, which reduces the risk of <a href="pulmonary%20aspiration">aspirating</a> food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by <a href="speech-language%20pathologist">speech-language pathologist</a>s with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.

People with Huntington's disease may see a <a href="physical%20therapist">physical therapist</a> for non-invasive and non-medication-based ways of managing the physical symptoms. Physical therapists may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. <a href="Walking%20aids">Walking aids</a> may be prescribed as appropriate. Physical therapists also prescribe breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques with the development of respiratory problems. Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington's disease have been produced by the <a href="European%20Huntington%27s%20Disease%20Network">European HD Network</a>. Goals of early <a href="Rehabilitation%20medicine">rehabilitation</a> interventions are prevention of loss of function. Participation in rehabilitation programs during early to middle stage of the disease may be beneficial as it translates into long term maintenance of motor and functional performance. Rehabilitation during the late stage aims to compensate for motor and functional losses. For long-term independent management, the therapist may develop home exercise programs for appropriate people.

Additionally, an increasing number of people with Huntington's disease are turning to palliative care, which aims to improve quality of life through the treatment of the symptoms and stress of serious illness, in addition to their other treatments.

<a href="Tetrabenazine">Tetrabenazine</a> was approved in 2000 for treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease in the EU, and in 2008 in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include <a href="neuroleptic">neuroleptic</a>s and <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s. Compounds such as <a href="amantadine">amantadine</a> or <a href="remacemide">remacemide</a> are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. <a href="Hypokinesia">Hypokinesia</a> and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with <a href="antiparkinsonian">antiparkinsonian</a> drugs, and <a href="myoclonic">myoclonic</a> hyperkinesia can be treated with <a href="valproic%20acid">valproic acid</a>.

Psychiatric symptoms can be treated with medications similar to those used in the general population. <a href="Selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s and <a href="mirtazapine">mirtazapine</a> have been recommended for depression, while <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotic</a> drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.

The families of individuals, and <a href="society">society</a> at large, who have inherited or are at risk of inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD, but may be unaware of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and of the availability of genetic testing. <a href="Genetic%20counseling">Genetic counseling</a> benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.

The length of the trinucleotide repeat accounts for 60% of the variation in the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.

Life expectancy in HD is generally around 20 years following the onset of visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and an increased risk of <a href="pulmonary%20aspiration">aspirating</a> food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. <a href="Suicide">Suicide</a> is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, <a href="Injury">physical injury</a> from falls, and malnutrition.

The late onset of Huntington's disease means it does not usually affect reproduction. The worldwide <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically as a result of ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in <a href="Ethnic%20group">peoples</a> of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower in the rest of the world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the <a href="Lake%20Maracaibo">Lake Maracaibo</a> region of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and specific regions of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local <a href="founder%20effect">founder effect</a>, a historical migration of carriers into an area of <a href="geographic%20isolation">geographic isolation</a>. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using <a href="genealogy">genealogical</a> studies. Genetic <a href="haplotype">haplotype</a>s can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that <a href="Icelanders">Icelanders</a> as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the <a href="Swedes">Swedes</a>; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.

Until the discovery of a <a href="genetic%20test">genetic test</a>, statistics could only include <a href="clinical%20diagnosis">clinical diagnosis</a> based on physical symptoms and a <a href="family%20history">family history</a> of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis. These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.

Although Huntington's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called "hereditary chorea" and "chronic progressive chorea". The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by <a href="Charles%20Oscar%20Waters">Charles Oscar Waters</a>, published in the first edition of <a href="Robley%20Dunglison">Robley Dunglison</a>'s "Practice of Medicine" in 1842. Waters described "a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums", including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease. In 1846 <a href="Charles%20Gorman%20%28physician%29">Charles Gorman</a> observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions. Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at <a href="Jefferson%20Medical%20College">Jefferson Medical College</a> in Philadelphia, <a href="Johan%20Christian%20Lund">Johan Christian Lund</a> also produced an early description in 1860. He specifically noted that in <a href="Setesdalen">Setesdalen</a>, a secluded mountain valley in <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, there was a high prevalence of dementia associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families.

The first thorough description of the disease was by <a href="George%20Huntington">George Huntington</a> in 1872. Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first paper. Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian inheritance</a>."Of its hereditary nature. When either or both the parents have shown manifestations of the disease ..., one or more of the offspring almost invariably suffer from the disease ... But if by any chance these children go through life without it, the thread is broken and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original shakers may rest assured that they are free from the disease.". Sir <a href="William%20Osler">William Osler</a> was interested in the disorder and chorea in general, and was impressed with Huntington's paper, stating that "In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described." Osler's continued interest in HD, combined with his influence in the field of medicine, helped to rapidly spread awareness and knowledge of the disorder throughout the medical community. Great interest was shown by scientists in Europe, including <a href="Louis%20Th%C3%A9ophile%20Joseph%20Landouzy">Louis Théophile Joseph Landouzy</a>, <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9-Magloire%20Bourneville">Désiré-Magloire Bourneville</a>, <a href="Camillo%20Golgi">Camillo Golgi</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20Jules%20Dejerine">Joseph Jules Dejerine</a>, and until the end of the century, much of the research into HD was European in origin. By the end of the 19th century, research and reports on HD had been published in many countries and the disease was recognized as a worldwide condition.

During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance. The English biologist <a href="William%20Bateson">William Bateson</a> used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including <a href="Smith%20Ely%20Jelliffe">Smith Ely Jelliffe</a>, to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies. Jelliffe collected information from across <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, <a href="Charles%20Davenport">Charles Davenport</a>, who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a> of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees. Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals. This research was further embellished in 1932 by <a href="P.%20R.%20Vessie">P. R. Vessie</a>, who popularized the idea that three brothers who left <a href="England">England</a> in 1630 bound for <a href="Boston">Boston</a> were the progenitors of HD in the USA. The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and <a href="eugenic">eugenic</a> bias of Muncey's, Davenport's, and Vessie's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD. Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, and were sometimes <a href="shunning">shunned</a> or <a href="exile">exile</a>d by society. This idea has not been proven. Researchers have found contrary evidence; for instance, the community of the family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD.

The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the <a href="Hereditary%20Disease%20Foundation">Hereditary Disease Foundation</a> (HDF) was created by <a href="Milton%20Wexler">Milton Wexler</a>, a <a href="psychoanalyst">psychoanalyst</a> based in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease. The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the <a href="Huntington%27s%20Disease%20Collaborative%20Research%20Project">Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project</a> who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.

Thanks to the HDF, the ongoing US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project was started in 1979, and reported a major breakthrough in 1983 with the discovery of the approximate location of a causal gene. This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease. It involved over 18,000 people—mostly from a single extended family.

Among other innovations, the project developed <a href="DNA">DNA</a>-marking methods which were an important step in making the <a href="Human%20Genome%20Project">Human Genome Project</a> possible. In 1993, the research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3, making this the first <a href="autosomal">autosomal</a> disease <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a> found using genetic <a href="linkage%20analysis">linkage analysis</a>.

In the same time frame, key discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the disorder were being made, including the findings by <a href="Anita%20Harding">Anita Harding</a>'s research group on the effects of the gene's length.

Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a> mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>s and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHTT fragments <a href="Protein%20folding">misfold</a> led to the discovery of the nuclear inclusions they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.

The condition was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term has been replaced by 'Huntington's disease' because not all patients develop chorea and due to the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.

Huntington's disease, particularly the application of the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when <a href="Charles%20Davenport">Charles Davenport</a> proposed in 1910 that <a href="compulsory%20sterilization">compulsory sterilization</a> and <a href="immigration">immigration</a> control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> movement. <a href="In%20vitro%20fertilization">In vitro fertilization</a> has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of <a href="Animal%20testing%23Ethics">animal testing</a> and <a href="embryonic%20stem%20cells">embryonic stem cells</a>.

The development of an accurate diagnostic test for Huntington's disease has caused social, legal, and ethical concerns over access to and use of a person's results.
Many guidelines and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals to decide when and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. <a href="Financial%20institution">Financial institution</a>s and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed with the <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Social%20Care">Department of Health and Social Care</a> that until 2017 customers need not disclose predictive genetics tests to them, but this agreement explicitly excludes the government-approved test for Huntington's when writing policies with a value over . As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under <a href="Age%20of%20majority">legal age</a> who is not judged to be <a href="Gillick%20competence">competent</a> is considered unethical in most cases.

There are ethical concerns related to <a href="Prenatal%20diagnosis">prenatal genetic testing</a> or <a href="preimplantation%20genetic%20diagnosis">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> to ensure a child is not born with a given disease. For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some. As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent does not want to know his or her own diagnosis. This would require parts of the process to be kept secret from the parent.

In 1968, after experiencing HD in his wife's family, Dr. Milton Wexler was inspired to start the <a href="Hereditary%20Disease%20Foundation">Hereditary Disease Foundation</a> (HDF), with the aim of curing genetic illnesses by coordinating and supporting research. The foundation and Wexler's daughter, <a href="Nancy%20Wexler">Nancy Wexler</a>, were key parts of the research team in Venezuela which discovered the HD gene.

At roughly the same time as the HDF formed, <a href="Marjorie%20Guthrie">Marjorie Guthrie</a> helped to found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease (now the <a href="Huntington%27s%20Disease%20Society%20of%20America">Huntington's Disease Society of America</a>), after her husband <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> died from complications of HD.

Since then, support and research organizations have formed in many countries around the world and have helped to increase public awareness of HD. A number of these collaborate in umbrella organizations, like the International Huntington Association and the <a href="European%20Huntington%27s%20Disease%20Network">European HD network</a>. Many support organizations hold an annual HD awareness event, some of which have been endorsed by their respective governments. For example, 6 June is designated "National Huntington's Disease Awareness Day" by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">US Senate</a>.

The largest funder of Huntington's disease research globally, in terms of financial expenditure, is the <a href="CHDI%20Foundation">CHDI Foundation</a>, a US <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a> biomedical foundation that aims to "rapidly discover and develop drugs that delay or slow Huntington's disease". CHDI was formerly known as the High Q Foundation. In 2006, it spent $50 million on Huntington's disease research. CHDI collaborates with many academic and commercial laboratories globally and engages in oversight and management of research projects as well as funding. Many organizations exist to support and inform those affected by HD.

Research into the mechanism of HD has focused on identifying the functioning of HTT, how mHTT differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting the early stages of <a href="drug%20development">drug development</a>. Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the progressive features of the disease. The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many <a href="transgenic%20animal">transgenic animal</a> models including <a href="nematode">nematode</a> worms, "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila</a>" <a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">fruit flies</a>, mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegeneration</a> and HD-like symptoms.

Research is being conducted on many different approaches to prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing the level of the mutant huntingtin protein (including <a href="gene%20splicing">gene splicing</a> and <a href="gene%20silencing">gene silencing</a>); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including <a href="protein%20homeostasis">protein homeostasis</a> and <a href="histone%20deacetylase">histone deacetylase</a> inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include <a href="phosphodiesterase%20inhibitors">phosphodiesterase inhibitors</a>.

<a href="Gene%20silencing">Gene silencing</a> aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by <a href="Ionis%20Pharmaceuticals">Ionis Pharmaceuticals</a> and led by <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Neurology">UCL Institute of Neurology</a>. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified for the first time in <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' <a href="immunoassay">immunoassay</a>, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, <a href="gene%20splicing">gene splicing</a> techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as <a href="CRISPR%23Cas9">CRISPR/Cas9</a>.

Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of mutant huntingtin are correction of <a href="transcriptional%20regulation">transcriptional regulation</a> using <a href="histone%20deacetylase%20inhibitor">histone deacetylase inhibitor</a>s, modulating <a href="Protein%20aggregation">aggregation</a> of huntingtin, improving <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and <a href="Mitochondria">mitochondrial function</a> and restoring function of <a href="synapses">synapses</a>.

<a href="Stem%20cell%20treatments">Stem cell therapy</a> is the replacement of damaged neurons by transplantation of <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>s into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s. Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying Huntington's disease in the laboratory.

Several clinical trials of new experimental treatments are underway and planned in Huntington's disease.

Compounds that have failed to prevent or slow progression of Huntington's disease in human trials include <a href="remacemide">remacemide</a>, <a href="coenzyme%20Q10">coenzyme Q10</a>, <a href="riluzole">riluzole</a>, <a href="creatine">creatine</a>, <a href="minocycline">minocycline</a>, <a href="ethyl-EPA">ethyl-EPA</a>, <a href="phenylbutyrate">phenylbutyrate</a> and <a href="dimebon">dimebon</a>.

Queen Victoria

Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was <a href="Queen%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> from 20 June 1837 until her death. On 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of <a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a>.

Victoria was the daughter of <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn</a>, the fourth son of <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a>. Both the Duke and the King died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her mother, <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate children. The United Kingdom was already an established <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of <a href="Victorian%20morality">personal morality</a>.

Victoria married her first cousin <a href="Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a> in 1840. Their <a href="%23Issue">nine children</a> married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> "the grandmother of Europe". After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">republicanism</a> temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Golden</a> and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of 63 years and seven months was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20in%20Britain%20by%20length%20of%20reign">longer than that of any of her predecessors</a> and is known as the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. She was the last <a href="British%20monarch">British monarch</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>. Her son and successor, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, initiated the <a href="House%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, the line of his father.

Victoria's father was <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn</a>, the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom, <a href="George%20III">George III</a>. Until 1817, Edward's niece, <a href="Princess%20Charlotte%20of%20Wales">Princess Charlotte of Wales</a>, was the only legitimate grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 he married <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>, a widowed German princess with two children—<a href="Carl%2C%203rd%20Prince%20of%20Leiningen">Carl</a> (1804–1856) and <a href="Princess%20Feodora%20of%20Leiningen">Feodora</a> (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the <a href="Emich%20Carl%2C%202nd%20Prince%20of%20Leiningen">Prince of Leiningen</a>. Her brother <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold</a> was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24May 1819 at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a> in London.

Victoria was christened privately by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Charles%20Manners-Sutton">Charles Manners-Sutton</a>, on 24June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace. She was baptised "Alexandrina" after one of her godparents, Emperor <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I of Russia</a>, and "Victoria", after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of Kent's eldest brother, <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George, the Prince Regent</a>.

At birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); <a href="Prince%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany">Frederick, the Duke of York</a>; <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William, the Duke of Clarence</a> (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's legitimate daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a>. The <a href="Regency%20Act%201830">Regency Act 1830</a> made special provision for Victoria's mother to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a <a href="regency">regency</a> could be avoided.

Victoria later described her childhood as "rather melancholy". Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called "<a href="Kensington%20System">Kensington System</a>", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering <a href="comptroller">comptroller</a>, Sir <a href="John%20Conroy">John Conroy</a>, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her <a href="King%20Charles%20Spaniel">King Charles Spaniel</a>, <a href="Dash%20%28spaniel%29">Dash</a>. Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin, but she spoke only English at home.
In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the <a href="Malvern%20Hills">Malvern Hills</a>, stopping at towns and great <a href="English%20country%20houses">country houses</a> along the way. Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to <a href="royal%20progress">royal progress</a>es and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.

By 1836, the Duchess's brother, <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold</a>, who had been King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry his niece to his nephew, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>. Leopold, Victoria's mother, and Albert's father (<a href="Ernest%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>) were siblings. Leopold arranged for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of <a href="Prince%20Alexander%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince Alexander of the Netherlands</a>, second son of <a href="William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands">the Prince of Orange</a>. Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, "[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful." Alexander, on the other hand, she described as "very plain".

Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold, whom Victoria considered her "best and kindest adviser", to thank him "for the prospect of "great" happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see." However at 17, Victoria, though interested in Albert, was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.

Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less than a month later, on 20 June 1837, <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a> died at the age of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In her diary she wrote, "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the <a href="William%20Howley">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and <a href="Francis%20Conyngham%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20Conyngham">Lord Conyngham</a> were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing gown) and "alone", and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that "I" am "Queen"." Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.

Since 1714, <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a> had shared a monarch with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Hanover</a> in Germany, but under <a href="Salic%20law">Salic law</a> women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s, her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%2C%20King%20of%20Hanover">Duke of Cumberland</a>, became <a href="King%20of%20Hanover">King of Hanover</a>. He was her <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> while she was childless.

At the time of Victoria's accession, the government was led by the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> prime minister <a href="William%20Lamb%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>. The Prime Minister at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen, who relied on him for advice. <a href="Charles%20Greville%20%28diarist%29">Charles Greville</a> supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was "passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one", and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure. <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Her coronation</a> took place on 28 June 1838 at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations. She became the first sovereign to take up residence at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> and inherited the revenues of the duchies of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cornwall">Cornwall</a> as well as being granted a <a href="civil%20list">civil list</a> allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's debts.

At the start of her reign Victoria was popular, but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, <a href="Lady%20Flora%20Hastings">Lady Flora Hastings</a>, developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy, and despised "that odious Lady Flora", because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the <a href="Kensington%20System">Kensington System</a>. At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to an intimate medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin. Conroy, the Hastings family, and the opposition <a href="Tories">Tories</a> organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as "Mrs. Melbourne".

In 1839, Melbourne resigned after <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radicals</a> and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolition of slavery</a>. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir <a href="Robert%20Peel">Robert Peel</a>, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the <a href="Royal%20Households%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Royal Household</a>, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's <a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">ladies of the bedchamber</a> were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the <a href="bedchamber%20crisis">bedchamber crisis</a>, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.

Though Victoria was now queen, as an unmarried young woman she was required by social convention to live with her mother, despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother's continued reliance on Conroy. Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see her. When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's close proximity promised "torment for many years", Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage, which Victoria called a "schocking alternative". Victoria showed interest in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband, but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.

Victoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839, just five days after he had arrived at Windsor. They were married on 10 February 1840, in the <a href="Chapel%20Royal%23The%20Chapel%20Royal%20St%20James%27s%20Palace">Chapel Royal</a> of <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, London. Victoria was love-struck. She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache, but wrote ecstatically in her diary:

Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Lord Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life. Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in <a href="Belgrave%20Square">Belgrave Square</a>. After the death of Victoria's aunt, <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20Sophia%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Augusta</a>, in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both <a href="Clarence%20House">Clarence</a> and <a href="Frogmore%20House">Frogmore House</a>s. Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved.

During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old <a href="Edward%20Oxford">Edward Oxford</a> attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a>, found not guilty on the grounds of <a href="insanity%20defence">insanity</a>, committed to an insane asylum indefinitely, and later sent to live in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the <a href="Lady%20Flora%20Hastings">Hastings</a> affair and the <a href="Bedchamber%20Crisis">bedchamber crisis</a>. Her daughter, also named <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria</a>, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: <a href="Edward%20VII">Albert Edward</a> (b. 1841), <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Alice</a> (b. 1843), <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Alfred</a> (b. 1844), <a href="Princess%20Helena%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Helena</a> (b. 1846), <a href="Princess%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Argyll">Louise</a> (b. 1848), <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Arthur</a> (b. 1850), <a href="Prince%20Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Leopold</a> (b. 1853) and <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Beatrice</a> (b. 1857).

Victoria's household was largely run by her childhood governess, Baroness <a href="Louise%20Lehzen">Louise Lehzen</a> from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Hanover</a>. Lehzen had been a formative influence on Victoria and had supported her against the Kensington System. Albert, however, thought that Lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along <a href="The%20Mall%2C%20London">The Mall, London</a>, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her, but the gun did not fire. The assailant escaped; however the following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plainclothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to <a href="Penal%20transportation">transportation for life</a>, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along <a href="Constitution%20Hill%2C%20London">Constitution Hill, London</a>. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, <a href="Robert%20Pate">Robert Pate</a>. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.

Melbourne's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria's reign, and in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201841">1841 general election</a> the Whigs were defeated. Peel became prime minister, and the <a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">ladies of the bedchamber</a> most associated with the Whigs were replaced.
In 1845, Ireland was hit by a <a href="potato%20blight">potato blight</a>. In the next four years, over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Famine</a>. In Ireland, Victoria was labelled "The Famine Queen". In January 1847 she personally donated £2,000 (equivalent to between £178,000 and £6.5 million in 2016) to the <a href="British%20Relief%20Association">British Relief Association</a>, more than any other individual famine relief donor, and also supported the <a href="Maynooth%20Grant">Maynooth Grant</a> to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition. The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to <a href="Battersea%20Dogs%20Home">Battersea Dogs Home</a>, was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.

By 1846, Peel's ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>. Many Tories—by then known also as <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a>—were opposed to the repeal, but Peel, some Tories (the "Peelites"), most Whigs and Victoria supported it. Peel resigned in 1846, after the repeal narrowly passed, and was replaced by <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Lord John Russell</a>.
Internationally, Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the <a href="House%20of%20Orleans">House of Orleans</a>, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe I</a> at <a href="ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Eu">château d'Eu</a> in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French monarch since the meeting of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> and <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> on the <a href="Field%20of%20the%20Cloth%20of%20Gold">Field of the Cloth of Gold</a> in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the <a href="revolutions%20of%201848">revolutions of 1848</a>, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a>, a private estate on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by <a href="Chartism">Chartists</a> and <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalists</a> failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.

Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen. She found particularly offensive the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, who often acted without consulting the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen. Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President <a href="Napoleon%20III">Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's</a> <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> in France without consulting the Prime Minister. The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>.

In 1853, Victoria gave birth to her eighth child, <a href="Prince%20Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Leopold</a>, with the aid of the new anaesthetic, <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>. Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child, <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Beatrice</a>, despite opposition from members of the clergy, who considered it against biblical teaching, and members of the medical profession, who thought it dangerous. Victoria may have suffered from <a href="postnatal%20depression">postnatal depression</a> after many of her pregnancies. Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control. For example, about a month after Leopold's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her "continuance of hysterics" over a "miserable trifle".

In early 1855, the government of <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a>, who had replaced Derby, fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form a ministry, but neither had sufficient support, and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister.

Napoleon III, since the Crimean War Britain's closest ally, visited London in April 1855, and from 17 to 28 August the same year Victoria and Albert returned the visit. Napoleon III met the couple at <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> and accompanied them to Paris. They visited the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281855%29">Exposition Universelle</a> (a successor to Albert's 1851 brainchild the <a href="Great%20Exhibition">Great Exhibition</a>) and <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon I</a>'s tomb at <a href="Les%20Invalides">Les Invalides</a> (to which his remains had only been <a href="retour%20des%20cendres">returned</a> in 1840), and were guests of honour at a 1,200-guest ball at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a>.

On 14 January 1858, an Italian refugee from Britain called <a href="Felice%20Orsini">Felice Orsini</a> attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England. The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister. Victoria and Albert attended the opening of a new basin at the French military port of <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> on 5 August 1858, in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in comparison to the <a href="French%20Navy">French one</a>. Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.

Eleven days after Orsini's assassination attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Prince Frederick William of Prussia</a> in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n state. Victoria felt "sick at heart" to see her daughter leave England for Germany; "It really makes me shudder", she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters, "when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one." Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm</a>, who would become the last German Emperor.

In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for "wickedly" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in <a href="Killarney">Killarney</a>. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> by <a href="Sir%20William%20Jenner%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Jenner</a>, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been "killed by that dreadful business", she said. She entered a state of <a href="mourning">mourning</a> and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname "widow of Windsor". Her weight increased through comfort eating, which further reinforced her aversion to public appearances.

Victoria's self-imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy, and encouraged the growth of the republican movement. She did undertake her official government duties, yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—<a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a>, and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847, <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>. In March 1864 a protester stuck a notice on the railings of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> that announced "these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant's declining business". Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public. She agreed to visit the gardens of the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a> at <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a> and take a drive through London in an open carriage.

Through the 1860s, Victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from Scotland, <a href="John%20Brown%20%28servant%29">John Brown</a>. Slanderous rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print, and the Queen was referred to as "Mrs. Brown". The story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie "<a href="Mrs.%20Brown%20%28film%29">Mrs. Brown</a>". A painting by Sir <a href="Edwin%20Henry%20Landseer">Edwin Henry Landseer</a> depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, and Victoria published a book, "Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands", which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly.

Palmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a> for the first time since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act 1867</a> which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, who charmed Victoria. "Everyone likes flattery," he said, "and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel." With the phrase "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were "a public meeting rather than a woman".

In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the <a href="Third%20French%20Republic">Third French Republic</a>. A republican rally in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> in her arm, which <a href="Joseph%20Lister">Joseph Lister</a> successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic <a href="phenol">carbolic acid</a> spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he recovered. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.

On the last day of February 1872, two days after the thanksgiving service, 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor, a great-nephew of Irish MP <a href="Feargus%20O%27Connor">Feargus O'Connor</a>, waved an unloaded pistol at Victoria's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace. Brown, who was attending the Queen, grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, and a <a href="birching">birching</a>. As a result of the incident, Victoria's popularity recovered further.

After the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>, the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>, which had ruled much of India, was dissolved, and Britain's possessions and protectorates on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> were formally incorporated into the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides. She wrote of "her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war", and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state "should breathe feelings of generosity, benevolence and religious toleration". At her behest, a reference threatening the "undermining of native religions and customs" was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201874">1874 general election</a>, Disraeli was returned to power. He passed the <a href="Public%20Worship%20Regulation%20Act%201874">Public Worship Regulation Act 1874</a>, which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported. She preferred short, simple services, and personally considered herself more aligned with the <a href="presbyterian">presbyterian</a> <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> than the <a href="Episcopal%20polity">episcopal</a> <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Disraeli also pushed the <a href="Royal%20Titles%20Act%201876">Royal Titles Act 1876</a> through Parliament, so that Victoria took the title "Empress of India" from 1 May 1876. The new title was proclaimed at the <a href="Delhi%20Durbar">Delhi Durbar</a> of 1 January 1877.

On 14 December 1878, the anniversary of Albert's death, Victoria's second daughter <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Alice</a>, who had married <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Louis of Hesse</a>, died of <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>. Victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as "almost incredible and most mysterious". In May 1879, she became a great-grandmother (on the birth of <a href="Princess%20Feodora%20of%20Saxe-Meiningen">Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen</a>) and passed her "poor old 60th birthday". She felt "aged" by "the loss of my beloved child".

Between April 1877 and February 1878, she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">Russo-Turkish War</a>, but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Congress of Berlin</a>. Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">Anglo-Zulu War</a> and the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a>. "If "we" are to "maintain" our position as a "first-rate" Power", she wrote, "we must ... be "Prepared" for "attacks" and "wars", "somewhere" or "other", CONTINUALLY." Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: "It is not in our custom to annexe countries", she said, "unless we are obliged & forced to do so." To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">1880 general election</a>, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by "fast falling tears", and erected a memorial tablet "placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I."

On 2 March 1882, <a href="Roderick%20Maclean">Roderick Maclean</a>, a disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria's refusal to accept one of his poems, shot at the Queen as her carriage left <a href="Windsor%20%26amp%3B%20Eton%20Central%20railway%20station">Windsor railway station</a>. Two schoolboys from <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman. Victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was "worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved".

On 17 March 1883, she fell down some stairs at Windsor, which left her lame until July; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter. <a href="John%20Brown%20%28servant%29">Brown</a> died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir <a href="Henry%20Ponsonby">Henry Ponsonby</a>, Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown. Ponsonby and <a href="Randall%20Davidson">Randall Davidson</a>, <a href="Dean%20of%20Windsor">Dean of Windsor</a>, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish "More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands", a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her "devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown". On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, <a href="Prince%20Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Leopold</a>, had died in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>. He was "the dearest of my dear sons", she lamented. The following month, Victoria's youngest child, <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Beatrice</a>, met and fell in love with <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Battenberg">Prince Henry of Battenberg</a> at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine</a> to Henry's brother <a href="Prince%20Louis%20of%20Battenberg">Prince Louis of Battenberg</a>. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry, but Victoria opposed the match at first, wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After a year, she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice's promise to remain living with and attending her.
Victoria was pleased when Gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated. She thought his government was "the worst I have ever had", and blamed him for the death of <a href="Charles%20George%20Gordon">General Gordon</a> at <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>. Gladstone was replaced by <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>. Salisbury's government only lasted a few months, however, and Victoria was forced to recall Gladstone, whom she referred to as a "half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man". Gladstone attempted to pass <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Bill%201886">a bill granting Ireland home rule</a>, but to Victoria's glee it was defeated. In <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201886">the ensuing election</a>, Gladstone's party lost to Salisbury's and the government switched hands again.

In 1887, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> celebrated <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Victoria's Golden Jubilee</a>. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was <a href="Abdul%20Karim%20%28the%20Munshi%29">Abdul Karim</a>. He was soon promoted to "<a href="Munshi">Munshi</a>": teaching her <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> (known as <a href="Hindustani%20language">Hindustani</a>) and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. <a href="Equerry">Equerry</a> <a href="Frederick%20Ponsonby%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sysonby">Frederick Ponsonby</a> (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to <a href="Victor%20Bruce%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">Lord Elgin</a>, <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>, "the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do." Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension, on her death.

Victoria's eldest daughter became Empress consort of Germany in 1888, but she was widowed within the year, and Victoria's grandchild Wilhelm became German Emperor as Wilhelm II. Under Wilhelm, Victoria and Albert's hopes of a liberal Germany were not fulfilled. He believed in <a href="autocracy">autocracy</a>. Victoria thought he had "little heart or "Zartgefühl" [tact] – and ... his conscience & intelligence have been completely wharped ".

Gladstone returned to power after the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201892">1892 general election</a>; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP <a href="Henry%20Labouch%C3%A8re">Henry Labouchère</a> to the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a>, so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him. In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebery</a> as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria's reign.

On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her grandfather <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> as the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20in%20Britain%20by%20length%20of%20reign">longest-reigning monarch in British history</a>. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, to coincide with her <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a>, which was made a festival of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> at the suggestion of the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>. The prime ministers of all the <a href="self-governing">self-governing</a> Dominions were invited to London for the festivities. One reason for including the prime ministers of the Dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite Victoria's grandson, <a href="Wilhelm%20II%20of%20Germany">Wilhelm II of Germany</a>, who, it was feared, might cause trouble at the event.

The Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession on 22 June 1897 followed a route six miles long through London and included troops from all over the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage, to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen.

Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays. In 1889, during a stay in <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit. By April 1900, the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war.

In July 1900, Victoria’s second son <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Alfred</a> ("Affie") died. "Oh, God! My poor darling Affie gone too", she wrote in her journal. "It is a horrible year, nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another."

Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood, Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame, and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts. Through early January, she felt "weak and unwell", and by mid-January she was "drowsy ... dazed, [and] confused". She died on Tuesday 22 January 1901, at half past six in the evening, at the age of 81. Her son and successor, <a href="King%20Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a>, and her eldest grandson, <a href="Emperor%20Wilhelm%20II">Emperor Wilhelm II</a>, were at her deathbed. Her favourite <a href="Queen%20Victoria%27s%20pets">pet</a> <a href="Pomeranian%20%28dog%29">Pomeranian</a>, Turi, was laid upon her deathbed as a last request.

In 1897, Victoria had written instructions for <a href="Funeral%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">her funeral</a>, which was to be military as befitting a soldier's daughter and the head of the army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward, Wilhelm and <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught</a>, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in <a href="Frogmore%20Mausoleum">Frogmore Mausoleum</a> at <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a>.

With a reign of 63 years, seven months and two days, Victoria was the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20in%20Britain%20by%20length%20of%20reign">longest-reigning</a> British monarch and the <a href="List%20of%20longest-reigning%20monarchs">longest-reigning</a> <a href="queen%20regnant">queen regnant</a> in world history until her great-great-granddaughter <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> surpassed her on 9 September 2015. She was the last monarch of Britain from the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>. Her son and successor Edward VII belonged to her husband's <a href="House%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>.

According to one of her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a detailed <a href="Queen%20Victoria%27s%20journals">journal</a>, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Beatrice</a>, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, <a href="Reginald%20Brett%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Esher">Lord Esher</a> transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by <a href="A.%20C.%20Benson">A. C. Benson</a>, <a href="Hector%20Bolitho">Hector Bolitho</a>, <a href="George%20Earle%20Buckle">George Earle Buckle</a>, Lord Esher, <a href="Roger%20Fulford">Roger Fulford</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Hough">Richard Hough</a> among others.

Victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and only about five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as <a href="Lytton%20Strachey">Lytton Strachey</a>'s "Queen Victoria" of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by <a href="Elizabeth%20Pakenham%2C%20Countess%20of%20Longford">Elizabeth Longford</a> and <a href="Cecil%20Woodham-Smith">Cecil Woodham-Smith</a>, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking. Contrary to popular belief, her staff and family recorded that Victoria "was immensely amused and roared with laughter" on many occasions.

Through Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> at the expense of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and the monarch. In 1867, <a href="Walter%20Bagehot">Walter Bagehot</a> wrote that the monarch only retained "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn". As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the "family monarchy", with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify, was solidified.
Victoria's links with Europe's royal families earned her the nickname "the grandmother of Europe". Victoria and Albert had <a href="Grandchildren%20of%20Victoria%20and%20Albert">42 grandchildren</a>, of whom 34 survived to adulthood. Their living descendants include <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>; <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>; <a href="Harald%20V%20of%20Norway">Harald V of Norway</a>; <a href="Carl%20XVI%20Gustaf%20of%20Sweden">Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden</a>; <a href="Margrethe%20II%20of%20Denmark">Margrethe II of Denmark</a>; and <a href="Felipe%20VI%20of%20Spain">Felipe VI of Spain</a>.

Victoria's youngest son, <a href="Prince%20Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Leopold</a>, was affected by the blood-clotting disease <a href="haemophilia%20B">haemophilia B</a> and at least two of her five daughters, <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Alice</a> and <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Beatrice</a>, were carriers. <a href="Haemophilia%20in%20European%20royalty">Royal haemophiliacs</a> descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, <a href="Alexei%20Nikolaevich%2C%20Tsarevich%20of%20Russia">Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia</a>, <a href="Alfonso%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias%20%281907%E2%80%931938%29">Alfonso, Prince of Asturias</a>, and <a href="Infante%20Gonzalo%20of%20Spain">Infante Gonzalo of Spain</a>. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to <a href="Legitimacy%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent</a>, but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.

Around the world, places and memorials are dedicated to her, especially in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth nations</a>. <a href="List%20of%20places%20named%20after%20Queen%20Victoria">Places named after her</a> include <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Africa's largest lake</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zambia">Victoria Falls</a>, the capitals of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> (<a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>) and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> (<a href="Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan">Regina</a>), and two Australian states (<a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>).

The <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, and it remains the highest British, <a href="Victoria%20Cross%20%28Canada%29">Canadian</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Cross%20for%20Australia">Australian</a>, and <a href="Victoria%20Cross%20for%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> award for bravery. <a href="Victoria%20Day%20%28Canada%29">Victoria Day</a> is a Canadian statutory holiday and a <a href="Victoria%20Day%20%28Scotland%29">local public holiday in parts of Scotland</a> celebrated on the last Monday before or on 24 May (Queen Victoria's birthday).


At the end of her reign, the Queen's full <a href="Style%20of%20the%20British%20sovereign%23Styles%20of%20British%20sovereigns">style and title</a> were: "Her Majesty Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> Queen, <a href="Fidei%20Defensor">Defender of the Faith</a>, Empress of India."


As Sovereign, Victoria used the <a href="royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom</a>. Before her accession, she received no grant of arms.

Dr. No (novel)

Dr. No is the sixth novel by the English author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> to feature his British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>. Fleming wrote the novel in early 1957 at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica. It was first published in the United Kingdom by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> on 31 March 1958. The novel centres on Bond's investigation into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow <a href="MI6">MI6</a> operatives. He establishes that they had been investigating <a href="Julius%20No">Doctor No</a>, a Chinese operator of a <a href="guano">guano</a> mine on the fictional <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> island of Crab Key. Bond travels to the island and meets <a href="Honey%20Rider">Honeychile Rider</a> and later Doctor No.

The novel began as a 1956 screenplay for the <a href="television%20producer">producer</a> <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%20III">Henry Morgenthau III</a> for a proposed television show entitled "Commander Jamaica". When those plans foundered, Fleming adapted the ideas as the basis for a novel, provisionally titled "The Wound Man". The book's eponymous villain was influenced by <a href="Sax%20Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a>'s <a href="Fu%20Manchu">Fu Manchu</a> stories.

"Dr. No" was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative criticism in Britain; <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Paul Johnson</a> of the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" dismissed the book as one of "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism". When released on the American market it was received more favourably. "Dr. No" was serialised in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", first in an abridged story form and later as a comic strip. The story was adapted in 1962 as the <a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">first film</a> in the <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">Bond series</a>, with <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> in the lead role; in 2008 <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> broadcast a version, with <a href="Toby%20Stephens">Toby Stephens</a> as Bond.

After recovering from serious poisoning inflicted by the <a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a> agent <a href="Rosa%20Klebb">Rosa Klebb</a> (in <a href="From%20Russia%2C%20with%20Love%20%28novel%29">"From Russia, with Love"</a>) the <a href="MI6">MI6</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a> is sent by his superior, <a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>, on an undemanding mission to the British <a href="Colony%20of%20Jamaica">Colony of Jamaica</a>. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston</a>, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of <a href="Julius%20No">Doctor Julius No</a>, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a <a href="guano">guano</a> mine. The island has a colony of <a href="roseate%20spoonbill">roseate spoonbill</a>s at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a>, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.

On his arrival in Jamaica, Bond soon realises that he is being watched. His hotel room is searched, a basket of poisoned fruit is delivered to the room —supposedly a gift from the colonial governor—and a deadly <a href="centipede">centipede</a> is placed in his bed while he is sleeping. With the help of an old friend, <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20allies%23Quarrel">Quarrel</a>, Bond surreptitiously visits Crab Key to establish whether there is a connection between No and the disappearance of the MI6 personnel. Bond and Quarrel meet <a href="Honey%20Rider">Honeychile Rider</a>, who is there to collect valuable shells. Bond and Rider are captured by No's men after Quarrel is burned to death by the doctor's "dragon"—a <a href="flamethrower">flamethrowing</a>, armoured <a href="swamp%20buggy">swamp buggy</a> designed to keep away trespassers. Bond and Rider are taken to a luxurious facility carved into the mountain.

No tells Bond that he is working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station">Cape Canaveral</a>. He had previously been a member of a Chinese <a href="Tong%20%28organization%29">tong</a>, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's <a href="dextrocardia">heart was on the right side of his body</a>, the bullet missed it and he survived.

Interested in the ability of the human body to withstand and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility's ventilation system. Bond is kept under observation as he suffers electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders. Bond's ordeal ends in a fight with a captive <a href="giant%20squid">giant squid</a>, which he defeats by using improvised weapons. After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.

Bond kills No by taking over the guano-loading machine at the docks and diverting the flow of guano to bury him alive. Bond and Rider then escape from No's complex in the "dragon" buggy, sail back to Jamaica and notify the colonial authorities.

In June 1956 the author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> began a collaboration with the <a href="television%20producer">producer</a> Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, "Commander Jamaica", which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea as the basis for "Dr. No". By January 1957 he had published four <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">Bond novels</a> in successive years from 1953—"<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>", "<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28novel%29">Live and Let Die</a>", "<a href="Moonraker%20%28novel%29">Moonraker</a>" and "Diamonds Are Forever". A fifth, "<a href="From%20Russia%2C%20with%20Love%20%28novel%29">From Russia, with Love</a>", was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica to write "Dr. No". He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in "<a href="Hansom%20Books">Books and Bookmen</a>" magazine: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled "The Wound Man".

Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. Chancellor put the events of "Dr. No" in 1956; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in February and March of that year.

As with his previous four novels, Fleming came up with the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, he instructed that she be shown on a "<a href="Venus%20%28bivalve%29">Venus elegans</a>" shell.

Prior to the release of "Dr. No"—and unconnected with the book itself—<a href="Bernard%20Bergonzi">Bernard Bergonzi</a>, in the March 1958 issue of "Twentieth Century", attacked Fleming's work, saying that it contained "a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism" and that the books showed "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures. The writer <a href="Simon%20Raven">Simon Raven</a>, while appreciating Bergonzi had produced a "quiet and well-argued article", thought that the critic's conclusion was naïve, and asked "Since when has it been remarkable in a work of entertainment that it should lack a specific 'ethical frame of reference'?" Raven continued, saying Fleming "by reason of his cool and analytical intelligence, his informed use of technical facts, his plausibility, sense of pace, brilliant descriptive powers and superb imagination, provides sheer entertainment such as I, who must read many novels, am seldom lucky enough to find".

In March 1956 Fleming and his friend Ivar Bryce accompanied <a href="Robert%20Cushman%20Murphy">Robert Cushman Murphy</a> (of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>) and <a href="Arthur%20Stannard%20Vernay">Arthur Stannard Vernay</a> (of the Flamingo Protection Society) on a trip to a flamingo colony on <a href="Great%20Inagua">Great Inagua</a> in the south of <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a>. The colony was of dense mangrove swamp and salt flats, home to flamingos, egrets and roseate spoonbills; the location inspired Crab Key. Much of the travel overland on Great Inagua was by a swamp vehicle, a <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a> fitted with over-large tyres that became the model for the "dragon" used in the story.

Fleming's inspiration for the Doctor No character was <a href="Sax%20Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a>'s villain <a href="Fu%20Manchu">Dr Fu Manchu</a>, who featured in books Fleming had read and enjoyed in earlier years. Aspects of the plot were influenced by Rohmer's work, and Winder observes that the use of the centipede was "a straight steal" from a Fu Manchu novel; other devices from Rohmer's novels included Doctor No's secret lair and the use of the mad scientist <a href="Trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a>.

As he had done in his previous novels, Fleming borrowed names from his friends and associates to use in his book; Ivar Bryce's housekeeper, May Maxwell, became Bond's Scottish "treasure" May. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell: Fleming named the guano-collecting ship in "Dr. No" as "Blanche". His friend <a href="Patricia%20Wilder">Patricia Wilder</a> found that her nickname of Honey Chile was used for the novel's main female character, and John Fox-Strangways—a friend from the gentlemen's club <a href="White%27s">White's</a>—saw part of his surname being used for the name of the MI6 station chief in Jamaica. Fleming also used the physical descriptions of people he knew; Quarrel, who previously appeared in the novel "Live and Let Die", was based on a Jamaican fisherman who often took Fleming shark fishing.

In "Dr. No", for the first time in the Bond novels, there is friction between Bond and M, brought about because Bond was nearly killed by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb in "From Russia, with Love". M orders Bond to use a new gun and sends him on a holiday assignment, which Bond resents. The writer <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees M at his most authoritarian in "Dr. No", punishing Bond both in terms of stripping him of his gun and then sending him on what both Bond and M considered at first to be a "soft" assignment.

Honeychile Rider is one of three women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow different to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other <a href="Bond%20girl">female characters</a> in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and <a href="Tony%20Bennett%20%28sociologist%29">Tony Bennett</a>, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is "not archetypically feminine", but is "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> that "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap what "could" you have been thinking of?"
Fleming's villain was physically disfigured, similar to many of Bond's later adversaries; No is tall, with steel pincers for hands and has <a href="dextrocardia">dextrocardia</a>. Bond describes him as "a giant venomous worm wrapped in grey tin-foil". Benson considers that No is "a wickedly successful villain", the best since <a href="Hugo%20Drax">Hugo Drax</a> in "Moonraker", while "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" thought No to be "one of the less forgettable characters in modern fiction".

Quarrel was Fleming's idealised concept of a black person, and the character was based on his genuine liking for Jamaicans, whom he saw as "full of goodwill and cheerfulness and humour". The relationship between Bond and Quarrel was based on a presumption of Bond's superiority. Fleming described the relationship as "that of a Scots laird with his head stalker; authority was unspoken and there was no room for servility". Winder considers the scenes with Quarrel to be "embarrassingly patronising but nonetheless hypnotic".

In "From Russia, with Love" Fleming experimented with an unusual narrative structure that saw Bond's entry into the story delayed until chapter eleven. For "Dr. No" he returned to the conventional form with which he felt comfortable—that of the thriller writers of the early 20th century. As a result, the story's villain is closer to the intellectual "gentleman crook" of the <a href="golden%20age%20of%20detective%20fiction">golden age of detective fiction</a>, and the novel's focus is on action at the expense of character development and depth of plot.

Benson describes the "Fleming Sweep" as taking the reader from one chapter to another using "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the "Fleming Sweep briskly propels the plot" of "Dr. No" through chapters that are longer than in previous Bond novels; the cultural historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> also likes "Dr. No"s pacing, despite considering it inconsistent in places. Winder believes that the novel's plotting is chaotic, although he still feels the book "can be read over and over again with immense pleasure".
Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the writer <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> calls "the Fleming effect". Amis describes "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced." The journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees the novel as "the most fantastical, gothic and melodramatic; and at times frankly, even knowingly, over the top", while Black considers the fantastic element of Doctor No's underground lair to be a "weak" and "bizarre" part of the story. When the writer <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a> reviewed the novel, he thought "that the long sensational business which is the heart of the book not only borders on fantasy. It plunges in with both feet. Ian Fleming's impetuous imagination has no rules." Writing in 1963, Fleming acknowledged his plots were "fantastical while often being based in truth. They go wildly beyond the probable but not, I think, beyond the possible".

Two main themes run through "Dr. No": the meaning of power; and the concept of friendship and loyalty. Bond talks about the meaning of power with several villains in the series. His conversation with Doctor No reveals that the latter believes it can only be secured through the privacy required to maintain the sovereignty of his island. No quotes <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a>'s <a href="On%20War">first principle</a>—about having a secure base from which to operate—in support of his argument. According to Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, "Dr. No" "shows a shift towards emphasizing the intellect and organizing power of the individual", as opposed to a group or nation. Black considers that although it is American assets that are under threat from the Soviet Union, it is British power, through the British agent, that concludes the issue. This is reinforced at the end of the book, when a modern British warship bearing British soldiers is despatched to the island. In Black and Parker's views, the display of British power, with no assistance from America, portrayed the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> as an enduring force.

The concept of friendship and loyalty is the second major theme. The relationship between Bond and Quarrel, the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islander</a>, is mutually felt. According to Lindner, Quarrel is "an indispensable ally" who had assisted Bond in "Live and Let Die". Benson sees no racial discrimination in the relationship between the two men and acknowledges that Bond feels genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death.

"Dr. No" was released on 31 March 1958 in the UK as a hardcover edition by the publishers <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. A paperback edition was issued by <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan Books</a> in February 1960; over 115,000 copies were sold that year. The first American edition was published in June 1958 by <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers%20%28United%20States%29">Macmillan</a> under the name "Doctor No". The largest boost in sales of the novel came in 1962 with the release of <a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">the film adaptation</a>. In the seven months after the picture's release, 1.5 million copies of the book were sold. In 1964 the novel was serialised in "<a href="France-Soir">France-Soir</a>" for the French market, which led to increased sales of Bond works in that country; 480,000 French-language copies of the six Bond novels were sold that year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.

For the first time in the Bond series, Fleming encountered harsh criticism. The most virulent came from <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Paul Johnson</a> of the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>", who opened his review, "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", with: "I have just finished what is, without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". He went on to say that "by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Although he recognised that Bond represented "a social phenomenon of some importance", he saw this as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned "three basic ingredients in "Dr. No", all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult". Johnson saw no positives in "Dr. No", saying that "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner."

Maurice Richardson, of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", considered the novel "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" referred to Johnson's "sex, snobbery and sadism" complaint. They highlighted the "sinister ... cult of luxury for its own sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel was a sign of moral decay; rather, "we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." This reviewer also conceded that while "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to "The Manchester Guardian" in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of "Dr. No" and the article in "The Twentieth Century". Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, (<a href="Vesper%20%28cocktail%29">"The Vesper"</a>) and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices "vulgar foibles" which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to <a href="toad-in-the-hole">toad-in-the-hole</a> and tele-bickies."

Writing in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", Philip Stead was more generous to "Dr. No". Despite thinking that Fleming was offering "too opulent a feast" with the book, Stead argued that Fleming managed to pull this off, where "a less accomplished writer ... would never have got away with this story." Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" and praised as "masterly" Fleming's depiction of colonial Kingston in the first chapter. Chandler admired Fleming's writing, which had "an acute sense of pace. ... You don't have to work at Ian Fleming. He does the work for you."

The reviewer for "Time" acknowledged the critical storm around Fleming and "Dr. No", but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while "not all readers will agree that "Dr. No" ... is magnificent writing, ... pages of it, at least, qualify for <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>'s classic comment on "<a href="Tropic%20of%20Cancer%20%28novel%29">Tropic of Cancer</a>": 'At last, an unprintable book that is readable'." In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>—described by Fleming's biographer <a href="John%20Pearson%20%28author%29">John Pearson</a> as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning of Fleming's work, saying "it's harder than ever to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as "true to form" and "a tirade" as Boucher concluded his review by saying: "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800."

Glendy Culligan of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" described the novel as a "thin little whodunit which rocked the British Empire and shook the English Establishment", adding "Bully for it!" Culligan admitted that "Confidentially though, we enjoyed "Dr. No", and if this be sick, sick, sick, gentlemen, make the most of it." James Sandoe in his book review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">The New York Herald Tribune</a>" was very positive about "Dr. No" and thought that it was "the most artfully bold, dizzyingly poised thriller of the decade. You'd much better read it than read about it."

The writer <a href="Simon%20Winder">Simon Winder</a> believes that because Fleming was writing about Jamaica, the result was "perhaps the most attractive of all the Bond books—the most relaxed, the most fiendish, the most confident". According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, Fleming knew his outdated view of Jamaica would soon be overtaken by events—as evidenced by the novel's description of how the Queen's Club would be lost during independence struggles. According to the cultural historian Michael Denning, this acknowledgement of the end-of-empire leads to a "sense of doom" that is the result of "a shadow of real history hanging over the stories".

"Dr. No" was serialised in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" from 19 March to 1 April 1958. In 1960 the novel was adapted as a daily comic strip in the paper and was syndicated worldwide. The strip, which ran from May to October, was written by <a href="Peter%20O%27Donnell">Peter O'Donnell</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>. It was reprinted in 2005 by <a href="Titan%20Books">Titan Books</a> as part of the "Dr. No" anthology that also includes "<a href="Diamonds%20Are%20Forever%20%28novel%29">Diamonds Are Forever</a>" and "From Russia, with Love". In 1962 the American men's magazine "<a href="Stag%20%28magazine%29">Stag</a>" serialised the story, renaming it as "Nude Girl of Nightmare Key".

The film "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">Dr. No</a>" was released in 1962, produced by <a href="Albert%20R.%20Broccoli">Albert R. Broccoli</a> and <a href="Harry%20Saltzman">Harry Saltzman</a>, and directed by <a href="Terence%20Young%20%28director%29">Terence Young</a>. It was the first Bond film in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> series; <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> portrayed Bond, with <a href="Joseph%20Wiseman">Joseph Wiseman</a> as Doctor No and <a href="Ursula%20Andress">Ursula Andress</a> as Honeychile Rider. Although the story follows the same general storyline, there are some changes: the film shows No to be an operative of the fictional crime organisation <a href="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> and his island fortress is nuclear-powered; No is killed not by the mountain of guano, but by drowning in reactor coolant. The novel was dramatised for <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in May 2008. The actor <a href="Toby%20Stephens">Toby Stephens</a> played Bond, while No was played by <a href="David%20Suchet">David Suchet</a>.

With the creation of "Sesame Street", producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a> to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied. The show, therefore, has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum.

Shortly after creating "Sesame Street", its producers developed what came to be called the "CTW model" (after the production company's previous name), a system of television show planning, production, and evaluation based on collaborations between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales, and other media. By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or "<a href="Sesame%20Street%20international%20co-productions">co-productions</a>", of "Sesame Street" broadcast in twenty countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of "Sesame Street", and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.

"Sesame Street" was by then the fifteenth-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American <a href="preschool">preschool</a>ers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched the series as children. As of 2018, "Sesame Street" has won 189 <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s and 11 <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, more than any other children's show.

"Sesame Street" was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Foundation</a> vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would "master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them", such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million ($ million in dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a>, the <a href="Corporation%20for%20Public%20Broadcasting">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a> and the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Federal Government</a> to create and produce a new children's television show. The program premiered on <a href="public%20broadcasting">public television</a> stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, there were over 150 versions of "Sesame Street", produced in 70 languages. As of 2006, 20 <a href="Sesame%20Street%20international%20co-productions">international versions</a> had been produced.

According to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s "Sesame Street"the show had become "an American institution". The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to, and expanded, other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book <a href="Royalty%20payment">royalties</a>, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. "Sesame Street"s curriculum has expanded to include more <a href="Affect%20%28psychology%29">affective</a> topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew, most notably, the 1982 death of <a href="Will%20Lee">Will Lee</a>—who played <a href="Mr.%20Hooper">Mr. Hooper</a>—and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.

By the end of the 1990s, "Sesame Street" faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in viewing habits of young children, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, "Sesame Street" made major structural changes. For example, starting in 2002, its format became more narrative and included ongoing storylines. After its thirtieth anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet <a href="Elmo">Elmo</a> the show also incorporated a popular segment known as "<a href="Elmo%27s%20World">Elmo's World</a>". Upon its fortieth anniversary in 2009, the show received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy at the <a href="36th%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">36th Daytime Emmy Awards</a>.

On August 13, 2015, as part of a five-year programming and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of "Sesame Street" would move to premium television service <a href="HBO">HBO</a> beginning with season 46, which premiered on January 16, 2016. HBO holds first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future "Sesame Street" episodes on <a href="HBO%20Go">HBO Go</a> and <a href="HBO%20Now">HBO Now</a>, assuming those rights from <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a> and <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>. On August 14 Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service, remaining in operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available free of charge or serving as a portal for "Sesame Street"s website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.

In April 2017, " Sesame Street" introduced Julia, a new Muppet who has <a href="autism">autism</a>, performed by <a href="Stacey%20Gordon">Stacey Gordon</a>, who has a son on the autism spectrum.

From its first episode, "Sesame Street" has structured its format by using "a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music," as well as animation and live-action short films. When "Sesame Street" premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long <a href="attention%20span">attention span</a>s, therefore the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. At first, the show's "street scenes"—the action taking place on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories. Instead, they consisted of individual, curriculum-based segments which were interrupted by "inserts" consisting of puppet sketches, short films, and animations. This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary the show's pace. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.

Upon recommendations by <a href="developmental%20psychology">child psychologists</a>, the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children. When the CTW tested the appeal of the new show, they found that although children paid attention to the shows during the Muppet segments, their interest was lost during the "Street" segments. The producers requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as <a href="Big%20Bird">Big Bird</a> and <a href="Oscar%20the%20Grouch">Oscar the Grouch</a> to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot. "Sesame Street"s format remained intact until the 2000s, when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format. In 1998, the popular "Elmo's World", a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created. Starting in 2014, during the show's 45th season, the producers introduced a half-hour version of the program. The new version, which originally complemented the full-hour series, and was both broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the Internet. The half-hour version of the show became the standard with the 46th season.

Author <a href="Malcolm%20Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> said that ""Sesame Street" was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them". <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a>, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. "Sesame Street" was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, "small but critical adjustments" to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, "Sesame Street" was one of the few children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from <a href="formative%20assessment">formative</a> and <a href="summative">summative</a> research.

The creators of "Sesame Street" and their researchers formulated both <a href="cognition">cognitive</a> and <a href="affect%20%28psychology%29">affective</a> goals for the show. Initially, they focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, in the belief that doing so would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. One of their primary goals was preparing very young children for school, especially children from <a href="poverty">low-income</a> families, using <a href="modeling%20%28psychology%29">modeling</a>, repetition, and humor to fulfill these goals. They made changes in the show's content to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal, and encouraged "co-viewing" to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including more sophisticated humor, cultural references, and celebrity guest appearances.

After "Sesame Street"s first season, its critics forced its producers and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of <a href="cultural%20diversity">diversity</a>, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, including the death of <a href="Will%20Lee">Will Lee</a> (<a href="Mr.%20Hooper">Mr. Hooper</a>) and the pregnancy of <a href="Sonia%20Manzano">Sonia Manzano</a> (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, "Sesame Street" addressed real-life disasters such as the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>.

The show's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.

As a result of Cooney's initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her an $1 million grant to create a new children's television program and establish the CTW, renamed in June 2000 to <a href="Sesame%20Workshop">Sesame Workshop</a> (SW). Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, <a href="The%20Arthur%20Vining%20Davis%20Foundations">The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations</a>, <a href="Corporation%20for%20Public%20Broadcasting">CPB</a>, and the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a>. Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show. As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks, but created challenges in procuring future funding.

After "Sesame Street"s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered "seed" money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a> refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.

In 1998, the CTW accepted <a href="sponsor%20%28commercial%29">corporate sponsorship</a> to raise funds for "Sesame Street" and other projects. For the first time, they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer <a href="Discovery%20Zone">Discovery Zone</a>, their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>, who had previously appeared on "Sesame Street", called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was "exploiting impressionable children". While first-run episodes on HBO do not have underwriting due to its status as a pay-TV network, repeats on PBS continue to have corporate underwriting.

Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, "Without research, there would be no "Sesame Street"". In 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, "positively heretical". Shortly after creating "Sesame Street", its producers began to develop what came to be called "the CTW model", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show's first season. According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: "the interaction of receptive television producers and <a href="child%20development">child science</a> experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning".

Cooney credited the show's high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a>, whom the CTW hired to design the show's educational objectives, and <a href="Edward%20L.%20Palmer">Edward L. Palmer</a>, who was responsible for conducting the show's formative research and for bridging the gap between the show's producers and researchers. The CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the <a href="Educational%20Testing%20Service">Educational Testing Service</a> (ETS) during the show's first two seasons, which measuring its educational effectiveness. Cooney stated, "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners". Cooney also described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".

"Sesame Street" has used many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of "Sesame Street"s original producers, has stated, it was difficult to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. <a href="Norman%20Stiles">Norman Stiles</a>, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would "burn out" after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, "Sesame Street" went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, "It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".

The show's research team developed an annotated document, or "Writer's Notebook", which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development. The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points, provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material. Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.

The research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed "a curriculum sheet" that described the show's goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an "assignment sheet" was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic. When a script was completed, the show's research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met. Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes, lights, and sets. The writers were present during the show's taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, and after 1992, at the <a href="Kaufman%20Astoria%20Studios">Kaufman Astoria Studios</a> in <a href="Queens">Queens</a> to make last-minute revisions when necessary.

Early in their history "Sesame Street" and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, "a multiple-media institution". In 1970, the CTW created a "non-broadcast" division responsible for creating and publishing books and "<a href="Sesame%20Street%20Magazine">Sesame Street Magazine</a>". They decided that all materials their licensing program created would "underscore and amplify" the show's curriculum. In 2004, over 68% of "Sesame Street"s revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing. By 2008, the "Sesame Street" Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, split between the Sesame Workshop and The Jim Henson Company.

<a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a>, the creator of the Muppets, owned the <a href="trademark">trademark</a>s to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, <a href="Sesame%20Street%20video%20games">computer games</a>, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts. Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions. Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show's airings. As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts.

Director Jon Stone, talking about the music of "Sesame Street", said: "There was no other sound like it on television". For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like "Sesame Street"s first musical director <a href="Joe%20Raposo">Joe Raposo</a> to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest. By 1991, "Sesame Street" and its songwriters had received eight <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammys</a>.

"Sesame Street" used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios, interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters. Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show. Shortly after "Sesame Street" debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home. These versions came to be called "co-productions". By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of "Sesame Street", and in 2006, there were twenty co-productions around the world. By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, "Sesame Street" was broadcast in more than 140 countries. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.

Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade". She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on "<a href="Captain%20Kangaroo">Captain Kangaroo</a>". <a href="Jon%20Stone">Jon Stone</a> was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Cameraman Frankie Biondo worked on "Sesame Street" from its first episode.

Jim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in "Sesame Street" began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should "make do without puppets". Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join "Sesame Street" to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the "Sesame Street" Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take "arcane academic goals" and translate them to "effective and pleasurable viewing". In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.

Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for "Sesame Street", instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities", both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show's first <a href="List%20of%20human%20Sesame%20Street%20characters">cast</a>. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the "most enthusiastic thumbs up" were cast. For example, <a href="Loretta%20Long">Loretta Long</a> was chosen to play <a href="The%20Robinson%20family%20%28Sesame%20Street%29">Susan</a> when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Little%20Teapot">I'm a Little Teapot</a>". As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was "just completely haphazard". Most of the cast and crew found jobs on "Sesame Street" through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.

According to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult <a href="List%20of%20human%20Sesame%20Street%20characters">cast</a> learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a "fresh quality", especially in its early years. Children were also used in the voice-over commentaries of most of the live-action films the CTW produced.

When "Sesame Street" premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen</a> rating, which totaled 1.9 million households. By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching "Sesame Street" daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.

The show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, due to changes in children's viewing habits and in the television marketplace. The producers responded by making large-scale structural changes to the show. By 2006, "Sesame Street" had become "the most widely viewed children's television show in the world", with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children. By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth-most-popular children's show on television.

As of 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding "Sesame Street"s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. The CTW solicited the <a href="Educational%20Testing%20Service">Educational Testing Service</a> (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show. ETS's two "landmark" summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. Additional studies conducted throughout "Sesame Street"s history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.

Lesser believed that "Sesame Street" research "may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children". He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry. Historian Robert Morrow, in his book "Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television", which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw "Sesame Street" as a "straightforward illustration for reform". Les Brown, a writer for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", saw in "Sesame Street" "a hope for a more substantial future" for television.

Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as "appeasement gestures". According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them. By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming. Other critics hoped that "Sesame Street", with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It was not until the mid-1990s that another children's television educational program, "<a href="Blue%27s%20Clues">Blue's Clues</a>", used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of "Blue's Clues" were influenced by "Sesame Street", but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, "We wanted to learn from "Sesame Street" and take it one step further".

Critic <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of "Sesame Street" has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially those concerning <a href="Bert%20and%20Ernie">Bert and Ernie</a>. One popular rumor points to Bert and Ernie being gay, as revealed by <a href="Mark%20Saltzman">Mark Saltzman</a>, one of the show's writers. In response, Sesame Street firmly denies the allegation.

"Sesame Street" was praised from its debut in 1969. "Newsday" reported that several newspapers and magazines had written "glowing" reports about the CTW and Cooney. The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it. In 1970, "Sesame Street" won twenty awards, including a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>, three Emmys, an award from the <a href="Public%20Relations%20Society%20of%20America">Public Relations Society of America</a>, a <a href="Clio%20Awards">Clio</a>, and a Prix Jeunesse. By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four <a href="Parents%27%20Choice%20Award">Parents' Choice Award</a>s. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> and the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>.

"Sesame Street" was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, where Henson was from, operated the state's PBS <a href="Mississippi%20Public%20Broadcasting">member station</a>; in May 1970 it voted to not air "Sesame Street" because of its "highly [racially] integrated cast of children" which "the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for". According to "", Lesser's account of the development and early years of "Sesame Street", there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called "surprisingly intense", stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, "the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them".

According to Morrow, the "most important" studies finding negative effects of "Sesame Street" were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Cook">Thomas D. Cook</a> during its first two seasons. Social scientist and <a href="Head%20Start%20%28program%29">Head Start</a> founder <a href="Urie%20Bronfenbrenner">Urie Bronfenbrenner</a> criticized the show for being too wholesome. Psychologist <a href="Leon%20Eisenberg">Leon Eisenberg</a> saw "Sesame Street"s urban setting as "superficial" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child. Head Start director <a href="Edward%20Zigler">Edward Zigler</a> was probably "Sesame Street"s most vocal critic in the show's early years.

In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to "Sesame Street"s depiction of Latinos and women. The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that "the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words". As "The New York Times" has stated, creating strong female characters "that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes" has been a challenge for the producers of "Sesame Street". According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on "Sesame Street" occurred slowly. As more female Muppets performers like <a href="Camille%20Bonora">Camille Bonora</a>, <a href="Fran%20Brill">Fran Brill</a>, <a href="Pam%20Arciero">Pam Arciero</a>, <a href="Carmen%20Osbahr">Carmen Osbahr</a>, <a href="Stephanie%20D%27Abruzzo">Stephanie D'Abruzzo</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Barnhart">Jennifer Barnhart</a>, and <a href="Leslie%20Carrara-Rudolph">Leslie Carrara-Rudolph</a> were hired and trained, stronger female characters like <a href="Rosita%20%28Sesame%20Street%29">Rosita</a> and <a href="Abby%20Cadabby">Abby Cadabby</a> were created.
In 2002, "Sesame Street" was ranked No. 27 on <a href="TV%20Guide%27s%2050%20Greatest%20TV%20Shows%20of%20All%20Time">TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time</a>.

Maurice Ravel

Joseph Maurice Ravel (; ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with <a href="Impressionism%20in%20music">impressionism</a> along with his elder contemporary <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.

Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the <a href="Paris%20Conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</a>; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of <a href="baroque%20music">baroque</a>, <a href="Neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neoclassicism</a> and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, "<a href="Bol%C3%A9ro">Boléro</a>" (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</a>'s "<a href="Pictures%20at%20an%20Exhibition">Pictures at an Exhibition</a>" is the best known.

As a slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as "<a href="Gaspard%20de%20la%20nuit">Gaspard de la nuit</a>" (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as "<a href="Daphnis%20et%20Chlo%C3%A9">Daphnis et Chloé</a>" (1912) require skilful balance in performance.

Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.

Ravel was born in the <a href="Northern%20Basque%20Country">Basque</a> town of <a href="Ciboure">Ciboure</a>, France, near <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, from the Spanish border. His father, <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Ravel">Pierre-Joseph Ravel</a>, was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in <a href="Versoix">Versoix</a> near the Franco-Swiss border. His mother, Marie, "née" Delouart, was <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one. Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a> and a notorious circus machine, the "Whirlwind of Death", an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus">Barnum and Bailey's Circus</a> in 1903.

Both Ravel's parents were <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholics</a>; Marie was also something of a <a href="Freethought">free-thinker</a>, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.

Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general. In later life, Ravel recalled, "Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age." There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer <a href="Roger%20Nichols%20%28musical%20scholar%29">Roger Nichols</a> suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father.

When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Emmanuel Chabrier</a>; five years later, in 1887, he began studying <a href="harmony">harmony</a>, <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Léo Delibes</a>. Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy. Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him "and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort". Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, variations on a theme by <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a> and a single movement of a piano sonata. They survive only in fragmentary form.

In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist <a href="Ricardo%20Vi%C3%B1es">Ricardo Viñes</a>, who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, Russian music, and the writings of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe</a>, <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Baudelaire</a>, and <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Mallarmé</a>. At the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281889%29">Exposition Universelle</a> in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the <a href="Russian%20Symphony%20Concerts">new Russian works</a> conducted by <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a>, also heard during the Exposition.

<a href="%C3%89mile%20Decombes">Émile Decombes</a> took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance. Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the <a href="Salle%20%C3%89rard">Salle Érard</a> along with other pupils of Decombes, including <a href="Reynaldo%20Hahn">Reynaldo Hahn</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a>.

With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. In November 1889, playing music by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome. Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student. Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist <a href="Arbie%20Orenstein">Arbie Orenstein</a> writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period "of immense growth... from adolescence to maturity." 
In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of <a href="Charles-Wilfrid%20de%20B%C3%A9riot">Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot</a>, for piano, and <a href="%C3%89mile%20Pessard">Émile Pessard</a>, for harmony. He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musical scholar Barbara L. Kelly, he "was only teachable on his own terms". His later teacher <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a> understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s. Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes. His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: "Sérénade grotesque", for piano, and "Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer", a "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>" setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).

Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were. It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer. From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs "Un grand sommeil noir" and "D'Anne jouant de l'espinette" to words by <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a> and <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment%20Marot">Clément Marot</a>, and the piano pieces "<a href="Menuet%20antique">Menuet antique</a>" and "Habanera" (for four-hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the "<a href="Rapsodie%20espagnole">Rapsodie espagnole</a>". At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>, who was earning a living as a café pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent. Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them "of inestimable value".
In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gedalge">André Gedalge</a>. Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer. As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported "a distinct gain in maturity... engaging wealth of imagination". Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20Dubois">Théodore Dubois</a>, who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook. Consequently, according to a fellow-student, <a href="Michel-Dimitri%20Calvocoressi">Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi</a>, he was "a marked man, against whom all weapons were good". He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture "<a href="Sh%C3%A9h%C3%A9razade%20%28Ravel%29">Shéhérazade</a>" and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating "auditeur" until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.

In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: "<a href="Pavane%20pour%20une%20infante%20d%C3%A9funte">Pavane pour une infante défunte</a>" ("<a href="Pavane">Pavane</a> for a dead princess"). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the <a href="Winnaretta%20Singer">Princesse de Polignac</a>. In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the "Shéhérazade" overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. One described the piece as "a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School" and called Ravel a "mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard." Another critic, <a href="Pierre%20Lalo">Pierre Lalo</a>, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic.

From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise. Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine. The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical. At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, "self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter." He dressed like a <a href="dandy">dandy</a> and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour. Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame, and bony in features, Ravel had the "appearance of a well-dressed jockey", whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect. During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven.

Around 1900, Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics, and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as <a href="Les%20Apaches">Les Apaches</a> ("The Hooligans"), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as "artistic outcasts". They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works. The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Manuel%20de%20Falla">Manuel de Falla</a> as well as their French friends.

Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years. In 1902 <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a> conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera" <a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.
Debussy was widely held to be an <a href="impressionism%20in%20music">impressionist</a> composer – a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy's "genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [his] <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolism</a>". During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece "Jeux d'eau" (1901), the <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Ravel%29">String Quartet</a> and the orchestral song cycle "Shéhérazade" (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet "at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence".

The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom. Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, "Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people." The public tension led to personal estrangement. Ravel said, "It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons." Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer <a href="Emma%20Bardac">Emma Bardac</a>. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante <a href="Misia%20Sert">Misia Edwards</a> and the opera star <a href="Lucienne%20Br%C3%A9val">Lucienne Bréval</a>, contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.

During the first years of the new century, Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>, past winners of which included <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>, <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>, <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Bizet</a>, <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a> and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist <a href="Paul%20Landormy">Paul Landormy</a>, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a "furore". He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, <a href="Charles%20Lenepveu">Charles Lenepveu</a>, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. "L'affaire Ravel" became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.

Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was <a href="Alfred%20Edwards%20%28journalist%29">Alfred Edwards</a>, owner and editor of "<a href="Le%20Matin%20%28France%29">Le Matin</a>", for which Lalo wrote. Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad.

By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were "Pavane pour une infante défunte" (orchestrated 1910), "<a href="Miroirs%23Structure">Une barque sur l'océan</a>" (1906, from the 1905 piano suite "<a href="Miroirs">Miroirs</a>"), the Habanera section of "Rapsodie espagnole" (1907–08), "<a href="Ma%20m%C3%A8re%20l%27Oye">Ma mère l'Oye</a>" (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), "<a href="Valses%20nobles%20et%20sentimentales%20%28Ravel%29">Valses nobles et sentimentales</a>" (1911, orchestrated 1912), "<a href="Miroirs%23Structure">Alborada del gracioso</a>" (from "Miroirs", orchestrated 1918) and "<a href="Le%20tombeau%20de%20Couperin">Le tombeau de Couperin</a>" (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).
Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. <a href="Manuel%20Rosenthal">Manuel Rosenthal</a> was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." When <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a> asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... "Complexe mais pas compliqué" was his motto."

Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and <a href="Marguerite%20Long">Marguerite Long</a> have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist <a href="H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20Jourdan-Morhange">Hélène Jourdan-Morhange</a>. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by <a href="Benjamin%20Ivry">Benjamin Ivry</a>; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.

Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.

The <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a>, founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>. Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president. The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle "<a href="La%20chanson%20d%27%C3%88ve">La chanson d'Ève</a>", Debussy's piano suite "D'un cahier d'esquisses", <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Kod%C3%A1ly">Zoltán Kodály</a>'s "Six pièces pour piano", and the original piano duet version of Ravel's " Ma mère l'Oye". The performers included Fauré, <a href="Florent%20Schmitt">Florent Schmitt</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Bloch">Ernest Bloch</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a> and, in the Debussy work, Ravel. Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911.

The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy "<a href="L%27heure%20espagnole">L'heure espagnole</a>" was premiered in 1911. The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, <a href="Albert%20Carr%C3%A9">Albert Carré</a>, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot – a <a href="bedroom%20farce">bedroom farce</a> – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.
In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of "Ma mère l'Oye", opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the "<a href="Mercure%20de%20France">Mercure de France</a>" called the score "absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature". The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the <a href="the%20Proms">Proms</a> later in the same year. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" praised "the enchantment of the work ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing." New York audiences heard the work in the same year. Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was "Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs", danced to the score of "Valses nobles et sentimentales", which opened at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Ch%C3%A2telet">Châtelet</a> in April. "<a href="Daphnis%20et%20Chlo%C3%A9">Daphnis et Chloé</a>" opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.

"Daphnis et Chloé" was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a> for his company, the <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a>. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, <a href="Michel%20Fokine">Michel Fokine</a>, and designer, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bakst">Léon Bakst</a>. Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; <a href="neurasthenia">neurasthenia</a> obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.

Ravel composed little during 1913. He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</a>'s unfinished opera "<a href="Khovanshchina">Khovanshchina</a>", and his own works were the "<a href="Trois%20po%C3%A8mes%20de%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Trois poèmes de Mallarmé</a>" for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, "À la manière de Borodine" and "À la manière de Chabrier". In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>". Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the "Rite" would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of "Pelléas et Mélisande".

When Germany invaded France in 1914, Ravel tried to join the <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a>. He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint. After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty. Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: "at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing". Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment. At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health. His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following <a href="amoebic%20dysentery">amoebic dysentery</a> in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter.

During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music. Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, "It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas." The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts.

Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a "horrible despair", compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war. He composed few works in the war years. The <a href="Piano%20Trio%20%28Ravel%29">Piano Trio</a> was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is "Le tombeau de Couperin", composed between 1914 and 1917. The suite celebrates the tradition of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Couperin">François Couperin</a>, the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war.

After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, "Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised". His output, never large, became smaller. Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era. Fauré wrote to him, "I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor." Ravel was offered the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a> as an establishment figure. Satie had turned against him, and commented, "Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it." Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development. Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks. He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style. Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries. The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a>, <a href="Virgil%20Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a> and <a href="George%20Antheil">George Antheil</a> and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Arnold Bax</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Scott">Cyril Scott</a>.
Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works. In 1920 he completed "<a href="La%20valse">La valse</a>", in response to a commission from Diaghilev. He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, "a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling". It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, "It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet. It's the portrait of a ballet". Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him. Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died. A ballet danced to the orchestral version of "Le tombeau de Couperin" was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of "La valse" followed in December. The following year "Daphnis et Chloé" and " L'heure espagnole" were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra.

In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> and <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>. Stravinsky, whose "Rite of Spring" was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale. His 1923 ballet score "<a href="Les%20noces">Les noces</a>" is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments. Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for "dépouillement" – the "stripping away" of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials. Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces. Other influences on him in this period were <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="atonality">atonality</a>. Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a> incorporated elements of it in their work. Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>, and its influence is heard in his later music. <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schönberg</a>'s abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the "<a href="Chansons%20mad%C3%A9casses">Chansons madécasses</a>" (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of "<a href="Pierrot%20Lunaire">Pierrot Lunaire</a>". His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite "<a href="Pictures%20at%20an%20Exhibition">Pictures at an Exhibition</a>" (1922), the opera "<a href="L%27enfant%20et%20les%20sortil%C3%A8ges">L'enfant et les sortilèges</a>" to a libretto by <a href="Colette">Colette</a> (1926), "<a href="Tzigane">Tzigane</a>" (1924) and the <a href="Violin%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Ravel%29">Violin Sonata</a> (1927).

Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside. In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of <a href="Montfort-l%27Amaury">Montfort-l'Amaury</a>, west of Paris, in the <a href="Yvelines">Yvelines</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20France">département</a>. Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life. At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad. His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy.

The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, "Boléro", became his most famous. He was commissioned to provide a score for <a href="Ida%20Rubinstein">Ida Rubinstein</a>'s ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate <a href="Isaac%20Alb%C3%A9niz">Albéniz</a>'s "<a href="Iberia%20%28Alb%C3%A9niz%29">Iberia</a>", he decided on "an experiment in a very special and limited direction ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music." Ravel continued that the work was "one long, very gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution. The themes are altogether impersonal". He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success. When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted "Rubbish!" at the premiere, he remarked, "That old lady got the message!" The work was popularised by the conductor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, and has been recorded several hundred times. Ravel commented to <a href="Arthur%20Honegger">Arthur Honegger</a>, one of Les Six, "I've written only one masterpiece – "Boléro". Unfortunately there's no music in it."

At the beginning of the 1930s, Ravel was working on two piano concertos. He completed the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20for%20the%20Left%20Hand%20%28Ravel%29">Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand</a> first. It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist <a href="Paul%20Wittgenstein">Paul Wittgenstein</a>, who had lost his right arm during the war. Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: "In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands." Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands. Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work. In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year. The critic Henry Prunières wrote, "From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us."

The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Ravel%29">Piano Concerto in G major</a> was completed a year later. After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting. Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted.
In October 1932, Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the "<a href="British%20Medical%20Journal">British Medical Journal</a>" in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting <a href="aphasia">aphasia</a>. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, "<a href="Don%20Quixote%20%281933%20film%29">Don Quixote</a>" (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and <a href="Jacques%20Ibert">Jacques Ibert</a> wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for <a href="baritone">baritone</a> and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as "Don Quichotte à Dulcinée". The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but <a href="Lucien%20Garban">Lucien Garban</a> and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a <a href="tumour">tumour</a>, and have variously suggested <a href="frontotemporal%20dementia">frontotemporal dementia</a>, <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> and <a href="Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob%20disease">Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease</a>. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.

In 1937, Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by <a href="Clovis%20Vincent">Clovis Vincent</a>, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find <a href="Ventricular%20system">ventricular</a> dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.

On 30 December 1937, Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at <a href="Levallois-Perret%20Cemetery">Levallois-Perret cemetery</a>, in north-west Paris. He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony.

<a href="Marcel%20Marnat">Marcel Marnat</a>'s catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned. Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra. The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental. Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera, and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or church works.

Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a> to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and Chopin. He considered himself in many ways a <a href="classicism">classicist</a>, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the <a href="ternary%20form">ternary</a>, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.
Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is "an implied melodic outline in all vital music". His themes are frequently <a href="musical%20mode">modal</a> instead of using the familiar major or minor scales. As a result, there are few <a href="leading-tone">leading notes</a> in his output. Chords of the <a href="extended%20chord">ninth and eleventh</a> and unresolved <a href="appoggiatura">appoggiatura</a>s, such as those in the "Valses nobles et sentimentales", are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language.

Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the <a href="bolero">bolero</a> and pavane, but also the <a href="minuet">minuet</a>, <a href="forlane">forlane</a>, <a href="rigaudon">rigaudon</a>, <a href="Waltz%20%28music%29">waltz</a>, <a href="czardas">czardas</a>, <a href="Habanera%20%28music%29">habanera</a> and <a href="passacaglia">passacaglia</a>. National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to <a href="Hebraic">Hebraic</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> and <a href="Romani%20people">gypsy</a> themes. He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Borodin</a>, Chabrier, Fauré and <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style. Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that "true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion", with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude.

Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others. The unrealised three were "Olympia", "La cloche engloutie" and "Jeanne d'Arc". "Olympia" was to be based on <a href="E.%20T.%20A.%20Hoffmann">Hoffmann</a>'s "The Sandman"; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far. "La cloche engloutie" after <a href="Gerhart%20Hauptmann">Hauptmann</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sunken%20Bell">The Sunken Bell</a>" occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a ""Symphonie horlogère"" which he incorporated into the opening of "L'heure espagnole". The third unrealised project was an operatic version of <a href="Joseph%20Delteil">Joseph Delteil</a>'s 1925 novel about <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>. It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it.

Ravel's first completed opera was "L'heure espagnole" (premiered in 1911), described as a "comédie musicale". It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered "perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects". <a href="Edward%20Burlingame%20Hill">Edward Burlingame Hill</a> found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, "giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action", and "commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage." Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity. The critic David Murray writes that the score "glows with the famous Ravel "tendresse"".

The second opera, also in one act, is "L'enfant et les sortilèges" (1926), a "fantaisie lyrique" to a libretto by Colette. She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than "L'heure espagnole", and the jazz elements and <a href="bitonality">bitonality</a> of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds "profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work". The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, "extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout".

Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad.

A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as "a static, recitative-like vocal style", prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility. By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in "Histoires naturelles". The same technique is highlighted in "<a href="Trois%20po%C3%A8mes%20de%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Trois poèmes de Mallarmé</a>" (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles "Shéhérazade" and "Chansons madécasses", Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.

Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as "Cinq mélodies populaires grecques", "Deux mélodies hébraïques" and "Chants populaires". Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, <a href="L%C3%A9on-Paul%20Fargue">Léon-Paul Fargue</a>, <a href="Leconte%20de%20Lisle">Leconte de Lisle</a> and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts.

Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, "Shéhérazade", to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.

During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous. He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use. The critic <a href="Alexis%20Roland-Manuel">Alexis Roland-Manuel</a> wrote, "In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a "pp" <a href="tam-tam">tam-tam</a> in the relationships of one orchestral group to another."
For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: "Rapsodie espagnole", "La valse" and the two concertos. All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in "Daphnis et Chloé", or as a reworking of piano pieces, "Alborada del gracioso" and "Une barque sur l'ocean", ("Miroirs"), "Valses nobles et sentimentales," " Ma mère l'Oye", "Tzigane" (originally for violin and piano) and "Le tombeau de Couperin." In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms. Occasionally, as in the "Alborada del gracioso", critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.

In some of his scores from the 1920s, including "Daphnis et Chloé", Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points. In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes. The critics <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West">Edward Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Shawe-Taylor%20%28music%20critic%29">Desmond Shawe-Taylor</a> comment that in the slow movement, "one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented", the composer "can truly be said to join hands with Mozart". The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, "Boléro" (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating "a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm".

Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite "Pictures at an Exhibition". Orchestral versions of the last by <a href="Mikhail%20Tushmalov">Mikhail Tushmalov</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> and <a href="Leo%20Funtek">Leo Funtek</a> predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known. Kelly remarks on its "dazzling array of instrumental colour", and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own.

Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch "from the striking simplicity of "Ma mère l'Oye" to the transcendental virtuosity of "Gaspard de la nuit"." Ravel's earliest major work for piano, "Jeux d'eau" (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later. When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity. The authors of "The Record Guide" consider that works such as "Gaspard de la Nuit" and "Miroirs" have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration "in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself."
Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in "Alborada del gracioso"... and the two outer movements of "Gaspard de la nuit". Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale." This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in "Gaspard de la nuit", "Le gibet" would "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.

Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; "Menuet sur le nom de Haydn" (1909), "À la manière de Borodine" (1912), "À la manière de Chabrier" (1913) and "Le tombeau de Couperin" all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner. Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: "Listen to "Le tombeau de Couperin" and the complete ballet music for "Ma mère L'Oye" in the classic recordings conducted by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Cluytens">André Cluytens</a>, and the piano versions never sound quite the same again."

Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works. The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier. Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour. The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet, and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards. It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the "Pavane pour une infante défunte". Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army. It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, "blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own," in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson.

Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the "Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré" for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of "Tzigane" for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist <a href="Jelly%20d%27Ar%C3%A1nyi">Jelly d'Arányi</a>. The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody. His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work. Ravel said that the violin and piano are "essentially incompatible" instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility. Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas "rather laboured and unsatisfactory", and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works.

Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on <a href="piano%20roll">piano roll</a> between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by <a href="Robert%20Casadesus">Robert Casadesus</a>, a better pianist. Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc. In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of "Jeux d'eau" played by <a href="Mark%20Hambourg">Mark Hambourg</a>, and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the "Pavane pour une infante défunte" and "Ondine", and movements from the String Quartet, "Le tombeau de Couperin" and "Ma mère l'Oye". Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor. A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as "Conducted by the composer", although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton. Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a "Boléro" in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist.

Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a>. He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> in 1921, the Belgian <a href="Order%20of%20Leopold%20%28Belgium%29">Ordre de Léopold</a> in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> in 1928.

After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it. the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours.

In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine "<a href="Le%20Point">Le Point</a>" reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.

Sesame Workshop

Sesame Workshop (SW), formerly the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), is an American <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a> which has been responsible for the production of several educational children's programs—including its first and best-known, "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>"—that have been televised internationally. Television producer <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> and foundation executive <a href="Lloyd%20Morrisett">Lloyd Morrisett</a> developed the idea to form an organization to produce "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>", a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed "one of the most important television developments of the decade".

"Sesame Street" premiered as a series on <a href="National%20Educational%20Television">National Educational Television</a> (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service (<a href="PBS">PBS</a>), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a> and <a href="Edward%20L.%20Palmer">Edward L. Palmer</a> were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the "CTW model". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of "Sesame Street", they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.

After "Sesame Street"s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the "Sesame Street" <a href="List%20of%20Sesame%20Street%20Muppets">Muppets</a> accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO during 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. 

On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its activities beyond television, and <a href="Gary%20Knell">Gary Knell</a> became CEO. <a href="H.%20Melvin%20Ming">H. Melvin Ming</a> replaced Knell during 2011. During 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.

During the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week. Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested "substantially lower" than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school. The topic of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes of early childhood education could increase children's cognitive growth.

During the winter of 1966, <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> hosted what she called "a little dinner party" at her apartment near <a href="Gramercy%20Park">Gramercy Park</a>. Attending were her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public television station WNDT (now <a href="WNET">WNET</a>), and won an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a> for a documentary about poverty in America. <a href="Lloyd%20Morrisett">Lloyd Morrisett</a> was a vice-president at <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Corporation</a>, and was responsible for funding educational research, but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention. Cooney was committed to using television to change society, and Morrisett was interested in using television to "reach greater numbers of needy kids". The conversation during the party, which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett, turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children. A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the office of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study for creating an educational television program for preschoolers. Cooney was chosen to perform the study.

During the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". The report described what the new series, which became "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>", would be like and proposed the creation of a company that managed its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW).

For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett researched and developed the new show, acquiring $8 million funding for "Sesame Street", and establishing the CTW. Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show's natural network would be PBS. Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations, but all three major networks rejected the idea. Davis, considering "Sesame Street"s licensing income years later, termed their decision "a billion-dollar blunder". Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition, and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it "defied conventional media wisdom". Cooney was responsible for the show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW. The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the <a href="Arthur%20Vining%20Davis%20Foundations">Arthur Vining Davis Foundations</a>, the <a href="Corporation%20for%20Public%20Broadcasting">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a>, and the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a>. Morrisett's friend Harold Howe, who was the <a href="United%20States%20Commissioner%20of%20Education">commissioner</a> for the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a>, promised $4 million, half of the new organization's budget. The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million. Mitgang stated, "Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney's report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea". Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks, but caused difficulty for procuring future funding.

Cooney's proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show's effect on its young viewers' learning. During 1967, Morrisett recruited <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> professor <a href="Gerald%20S.%20Lesser">Gerald S. Lesser</a>, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>, to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. During 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW. Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about "Sesame Street" and its effect on young children. Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop's advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's television shows, it contributed significantly to the series' design and implementation. Lesser reported in "", his 1974 book about the beginnings of "Sesame Street" and the Children's Television Workshop, that about 8—10% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.

CTW's summative research was done by the Workshop's first research director, <a href="Edward%20L.%20Palmer">Edward L. Palmer</a>, whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston during the summer of 1967. During the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop's research activities, and hire his research team. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying the interaction of children and television at the time. They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model". Cooney observed of the CTW model: "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners". She described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".

The CTW devoted 8% of its initial budget to outreach and publicity. In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called "an extensive campaign" that Lesser stated "would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research", the Workshop promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and the show's target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired <a href="Evelyn%20Payne%20Davis">Evelyn Payne Davis</a> from the <a href="Urban%20League">Urban League</a>, whom Michael Davis called "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division. Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning "Sesame Street" during its first year of production.

According to Davis, despite her involvement with the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, "Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries". At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post during February 1968. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was termed "one of the most important television developments of the decade". The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the <a href="Waldorf-Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a> in New York City on 20 May 1968.

After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to broadcast the new series. She assembled a team of producers: <a href="Jon%20Stone">Jon Stone</a> was responsible for writing, casting, and format; <a href="David%20Connell%20%28television%20producer%29">David Connell</a> assumed control of animation and volume production; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on another children's show, "<a href="Captain%20Kangaroo">Captain Kangaroo</a>", together. Cooney later said about "Sesame Street"s original team of producers, "collectively, we were a genius". CTW's first children's show, "Sesame Street", premiered on 10 November 1969. The CTW was not incorporated until 1970 because its creators wanted to see if the series was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants. Morrisett served as the first chairperson of CTW's board of trustees, a job he had for 28 years.

During the second season of "Sesame Street", to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press, the Workshop created its second series, "<a href="The%20Electric%20Company">The Electric Company</a>", during 1971. Morrisett used the same fund-acquisition techniques as he had used for "Sesame Street". "The Electric Company" stopped production in 1977, but continued in re-runs until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was <a href="The%20Electric%20Company%20%282009%20TV%20series%29">revived in 2009</a>. Starting during early 1970s, the Workshop ventured into adult programming, but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio-economic groups. During 1971, it produced a medical program for adults termed "Feelin' Good", hosted by <a href="Dick%20Cavett">Dick Cavett</a>, which was broadcast until 1974. According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show "lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience". During 1977, the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called "Best of Families", which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century. However, it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children's programs only.

Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts changed from promotion to the development of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in <a href="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, in <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> communities, and in <a href="migrant%20worker">migrant worker</a> camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.

According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a problematic period for the Workshop. Other than "Sesame Street", many of its productions were not successful. "<a href="3-2-1%20Contact">3-2-1 Contact</a>" premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like "<a href="Square%20One%20Television">Square One Television</a>", which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s to work on their licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.

Cooney resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW during 1990, when she was replaced by David Britt, who was her "chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid-1990s" and whom Cooney termed her "right-hand for many years". Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988. At that time, Cooney became chairman of the Workshop's executive board, which managed its businesses and licensing, and became more involved with the organization's creative efforts.

The Workshop had a reorganization during 1995, and dismissed about 12 percent of its staff. During 1998, for the first time in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for "Sesame Street" and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>. The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel <a href="Noggin%20%28TV%20channel%29">Noggin</a>, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a>'s <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the "Tickle Me Elmo" craze, enabled the CTW to purchase <a href="The%20Jim%20Henson%20Company">The Jim Henson Company</a>'s rights to the "Sesame Street" Muppets from the German media company <a href="EM.TV">EM.TV</a>, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected "Sesame Street" and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".

The CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop (SW) on June 5, 2000 (television); and on May 7, 2001 (home media), to better represent its non-television activities and interactive media. The website www.ctw.org changed its domain name to www.sesameworkshop.org on June 5, 2000. Also during 2000, <a href="Gary%20Knell">Gary Knell</a> succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop; according to Davis, he "presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit's history". Knell was instrumental in the creation of the cable channel <a href="Universal%20Kids">Universal Kids</a> (formerly Sprout TV network) during 2005. Sprout (launched as PBS Kids Sprout) was founded as a partnership between the Workshop, <a href="Comcast">Comcast</a>, <a href="PBS">PBS</a>, and <a href="HIT%20Entertainment">HIT Entertainment</a>, all of whom contributed programming to the new network. After seven years as a partner, the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout during December 2012.

During 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded <a href="The%20Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney%20Center">The Joan Ganz Cooney Center</a>, an independent, non-profit organization that studies how to improve children's literacy by using and developing digital technologies "grounded in detailed educational curriculum", just as was done during the development of "Sesame Street". During 2009, the SW launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show's history.

The 2008–2009 recession, which resulted in budget reductions for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected the SW; during 2009, it had to dismiss 20% of its staff. Despite earning about $100 million from licensing revenue, royalties, and foundation and government funding during 2012, the Workshop's total revenue was down 15% and its operating loss doubled to $24.3 million. During 2013, it responded by dismissing 10% of its staff, saying that it was necessary to "strategically focus" their resources because of "today's rapidly changing digital environment". During 2011, Knell left the SW to become the chief executive of National Public Radio <a href="NPR">NPR</a>; <a href="H.%20Melvin%20Ming">H. Melvin Ming</a> was named as his replacement. Ming had been chief financial officer since 1999 and its chief operating officer since 2002.

During 2014, H. Melvin Ming retired and was succeeded by former HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon executive Jeffery D. Dunn. Dunn's appointment was the first time someone not affiliated with the SW became its manager, although he had associations with the organization previously. As of December 2014, the senior management at the SW consisted of: Dr. Lewis Bernstein, Executive Vice President and director of Education Research and Outreach; Terry Fitzpatrick, who was Executive Vice President and responsible for content distribution; Myung Kang-Huenke, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Secretary; Daryl Mintz, Chief Financial Officer; Sherrie Westin, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Michael H. Levine, Executive Director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center. The organization's board of trustees included, among others: its chair, Vincent A. Mai, who was also chairman of AEA Investors, Inc.; Cooney, Morrisett, and Dunn.

After "Sesame Street"s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Although the organization was what Cooney termed "the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years", its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two; during 1978, the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Education">US Department of Education</a> refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. According to Davis, the federal government was opposed to funding public television, but the Workshop used Cooney's prestige and fame, and the fact that there would be "great public outcry" if the series was de-funded, to withstand the government's attacks on PBS. Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget, but by 1981, government funding for "Sesame Street" had been terminated.

For the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money. Immediately after its premiere, "Sesame Street "gained attention from marketers, so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a "multiple media institution". Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment, which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects. Muppet creator <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a> owned the trademarks to the <a href="List%20of%20Sesame%20Street%20Muppets">Muppet characters</a>: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of "Sesame Street". As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts. During the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named <a href="Christopher%20Cerf%20%28musician%20and%20television%20producer%29">Christopher Cerf</a> to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum.

Soon after the premiere of "Sesame Street", producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. <a href="CBS">CBS</a> executive <a href="Michael%20Dann">Michael Dann</a> was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called "<a href="rural%20purge">rural purge</a>"; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant. Dann then began developing foreign versions of "Sesame Street" by arranging what were eventually termed <a href="International%20co-productions%20of%20Sesame%20Street">co-productions</a>, or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, "Sesame Street" had expanded into 140 countries; "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported during 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the "Sesame Street" Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, divided between the Workshop and <a href="Henson%20Associates">Henson Associates</a>.

During 1970, the CTW established a department managing the development of "nonbroadcast" materials based upon "Sesame Street". The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would "underscore and amplify" the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations. The CTW published "Sesame Street Magazine" during 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format. As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group during 1975.

Working with <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage "Sesame Street"s book publishing program. During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series, and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW during 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's seriess. As of 2001, there were more than 600 books available in the "Sesame Street" library, and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated, "the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street". In one of these books, for example, the death of the "Sesame Street" character <a href="Mr.%20Hooper">Mr. Hooper</a> was featured in a book entitled "I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper", published soon after the series featured it during 1983.

According to director Jon Stone, the music of "Sesame Street" was unlike any other children's program on television. For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum. Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an "affinity for commercial jingles", so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.

To attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, "helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show". Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts. Songwriters of note were <a href="Joe%20Raposo">Joe Raposo</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Moss">Jeff Moss</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Cerf%20%28producer%29">Christopher Cerf</a>, <a href="Tony%20Geiss">Tony Geiss</a>, and <a href="Norman%20Stiles">Norman Stiles</a>. Many of the songs written for "Sesame Street" have become what writer David Borgenicht termed "timeless classics". These songs included the "Sesame Street Theme" (known also as "Sunny Day"), "I Love Trash", "Rubber Duckie", "Bein' Green", and "Sing". Many "Sesame Street" songs were recorded by well-known artists such as <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>, <a href="Lena%20Horne">Lena Horne</a>, <a href="Dizzy%20Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a>, <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>, and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Feliciano">Jose Feliciano</a>.

The series' first album, "Sesame Street Book & Record", recorded during 1970, was a major success and won a Grammy Award. " Entertainment Weekly" reported that by 1991, "Sesame Street" had received eight Grammys. According to Gikow, Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work for the series.

Soon after "Sesame Street" debuted in the USA, the CTW was asked independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the series in their countries. Cooney remarked, "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former <a href="CBS">CBS</a> executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of "Sesame Street" in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic <a href="Marvin%20Kitman">Marvin Kitman</a> said, "After [Dann] sells ["Sesame Street"] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 decision by the state's <a href="Mississippi%20Public%20Broadcasting">PBS station</a> to not air the series. By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term "co-productions".

The earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues termed "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed versions of the series with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the series continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television series in other countries. By 2006, there were twenty co-productions. During 2001, there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of "Sesame Street", and by the show's 40th anniversary during 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries. During 2005, Doreen Carvajal of "The New York Times" reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million. As Cole and her colleagues reported during 2000, "Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world".

Ten years after the premiere of "Sesame Street", the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. During 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened during 1980 in <a href="Langhorne%2C%20Pennsylvania">Langhorne, Pennsylvania</a>. Three international parks, "Parque Plaza Sesamo" in <a href="Monterrey%2C%20Mexico">Monterrey, Mexico</a> since 1995, Universal Studios <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, and "Vila Sesamo" Kids' Land in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> were later built. One of the park's features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) during 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW during the late 1980s. As "Sesame Street" researcher Shalom M. Fisch stated, no television series could be as interactive as computer games, even "participatory" shows like "<a href="Blue%27s%20Clues">Blue's Clues</a>" or the "Sesame Street" segment "<a href="Elmo%27s%20World">Elmo's World</a>". The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series' content and curriculum.

During 2008, a new "research-driven" website was created; it had 18 million downloads in one month. Also during 2008, the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on the websites <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>, <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, and <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, where "Word on the Street" segments became the most popular webcast. During 2010, the Workshop began offering <a href="Ebooks">eBooks</a> through the series' website, including a free rotating selection of five titles. Their selection of eBooks came in a variety of formats, some of which were interactive, and covered nineteen topics, including letters, numbers, counting, colors, and cultural appreciation.

Mary of Teck

Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867 – 24 March 1953) was <a href="List%20of%20British%20royal%20consorts">Queen of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="British%20Dominions">British Dominions</a> and <a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a> as the wife of <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>.

Although technically a princess of <a href="Teck">Teck</a>, in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of Württemberg</a>, she was born and raised in <a href="England">England</a>. Her parents were <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teck">Francis, Duke of Teck</a>, who was of German extraction, and <a href="Princess%20Mary%20Adelaide%20of%20Cambridge">Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge</a>, who was a granddaughter of <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a>. She was informally known as "May", after her birth month. 

At the age of 24, she was betrothed to her second cousin once removed <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, the eldest son of the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a>, but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement, he died unexpectedly during an <a href="influenza%20pandemic">influenza pandemic</a>. The following year, she became engaged to Albert Victor's next surviving brother, <a href="George%20V">George</a>, who subsequently became king. Before her husband's accession, she was successively <a href="Duchess%20of%20York">Duchess of York</a>, <a href="Duchess%20of%20Cornwall">Duchess of Cornwall</a>, and <a href="Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess of Wales</a>.

As <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a> from 1910, she supported her husband through the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, his ill health, and major political changes arising from the <a href="Aftermath%20of%20World%20War%20I">aftermath of the war</a>. After George's death in 1936, she became <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> when her eldest son, <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>, ascended the throne, but to her dismay, he <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdicated</a> later the same year in order to marry twice-divorced American socialite <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>. She supported her second son, <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>, until his death in 1952. She died the following year, during the reign of her granddaughter <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, who had not yet been crowned.

Princess Victoria Mary ("May") of Teck was born on 26 May 1867 at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, in the same room where <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, her first cousin once removed, was born 48 years and two days earlier. Queen Victoria came to visit the baby, writing that she was "a very fine one, with pretty little features and a quantity of hair". May would become the first queen consort born in England since <a href="Catherine%20Parr">Catherine Parr</a>. Her father was Prince <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teck">Francis, Duke of Teck</a>, the son of <a href="Duke%20Alexander%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg%20%281804%E2%80%931885%29">Duke Alexander of Württemberg</a> by his <a href="morganatic">morganatic</a> wife, <a href="Countess%20Claudine%20Rh%C3%A9dey%20von%20Kis-Rh%C3%A9de">Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde</a> (created Countess von Hohenstein in the Austrian Empire). Her mother was <a href="Princess%20Mary%20Adelaide%20of%20Cambridge">Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge</a>, a granddaughter of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> and the third child and younger daughter of <a href="Prince%20Adolphus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge</a>, and <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel</a>.

She was baptised in the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a> of Kensington Palace on 27 July 1867 by <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Longley">Charles Thomas Longley</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. From an early age, she was known to her family, friends and the public by the diminutive name of "May", after her birth month. 

May's upbringing was "merry but fairly strict". She was the eldest of four children, the only daughter, and "learned to exercise her native discretion, firmness, and tact" by resolving her three younger brothers' petty boyhood squabbles. They played with their cousins, the children of the Prince of Wales, who were similar in age. She grew up at Kensington Palace and <a href="White%20Lodge">White Lodge</a>, in <a href="Richmond%20Park">Richmond Park</a>, which was granted by Queen Victoria on permanent loan, and was educated at home by her mother and governess (as were her brothers until they were sent to boarding schools). The Duchess of Teck spent an unusually long time with her children for a lady of her time and class, and enlisted May in various charitable endeavours, which included visiting the tenements of the poor.

Although May was a great-grandchild of George III, she was only a minor member of the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a>. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of <a href="Serene%20Highness">Serene Highness</a> because his parents' marriage was morganatic. The Duchess of Teck was granted a <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliamentary</a> <a href="Annuity%20%28financial%20contracts%29">annuity</a> of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, but she donated lavishly to dozens of charities. Prince Francis was deeply in debt and moved his family abroad with a small staff in 1883, in order to economise. They travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums. She was fluent in English, German, and French.

In 1885, the family returned to London and lived for some time in <a href="Chester%20Square">Chester Square</a>. May was close to her mother, and acted as an unofficial secretary, helping to organise parties and social events. She was also close to her aunt, the <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20of%20Cambridge">Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>, and wrote to her every week. During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the <a href="Princess%20Margaret%20of%20Connaught">Crown Princess of Sweden</a> helped pass letters from May to her aunt, who lived in enemy territory in <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> until her death in 1916.

In 1886, Princess May was a debutante in her first <a href="season%20%28society%29">season</a> and introduced at court. Her status as the only unmarried British princess who was not descended from Queen Victoria made her a suitable candidate for the royal family's most eligible bachelor, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, her <a href="second%20cousin%20once%20removed">second cousin once removed</a> and the eldest son of the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a>.

In December 1891, May and Albert Victor were engaged. The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to Queen Victoria's fondness for her, as well as to her strong character and sense of duty. However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in a recurrence of the worldwide <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20flu%20pandemic">1889–90</a> <a href="influenza%20pandemic">influenza pandemic</a>, before the date was fixed for their wedding.

Albert Victor's brother, <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Prince George, Duke of York</a>, now second in line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a suitable candidate to marry a future king. The public was also anxious that the Duke of York should marry and settle the succession. In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, never took a mistress.

May married Prince George, Duke of York, in London on 6 July 1893 at the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a>, <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>. The new Duke and Duchess of York lived in <a href="York%20Cottage">York Cottage</a> on the <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham Estate</a> in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, and in apartments in St James's Palace. York Cottage was a modest house for royalty, but it was a favourite of George, who liked a relatively simple life. They had six children: <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward</a>, <a href="George%20VI">Albert</a>, <a href="Mary%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Countess%20of%20Harewood">Mary</a>, <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Henry</a>, <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">George</a>, and <a href="Prince%20John%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">John</a>.

The children were put into the care of a nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, <a href="Charlotte%20Bill">Charlotte Bill</a>.

Sometimes, Mary and George appear to have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their youngest son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, she was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. 

Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day ... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death."

As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May carried out a variety of public duties. In 1897, she became the patron of the <a href="Queen%20Mother%27s%20Clothing%20Guild">London Needlework Guild</a> in succession to her mother. The guild, initially established as The London Guild in 1882, was renamed several times and was named after May between 1914 and 2010. Samples of her own embroidery range from chair seats to tea cosies.
On 22 January 1901, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> died, and May's father-in-law ascended the throne. For most of the rest of that year, George and May were known as the "Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York". For eight months they toured the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, visiting <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. No royal had undertaken such an ambitious tour before. She broke down in tears at the thought of leaving her children, who were to be left in the care of their grandparents, for such a long time.

On 9 November 1901, nine days after arriving back in Britain and on the King's sixtieth birthday, George was created <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. The family moved their London residence from St James's Palace to <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a>. As Princess of Wales, May accompanied her husband on trips to <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> in 1904. The following year, she gave birth to her last child, John. It was a difficult labour, and although she recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered respiratory problems.

From October 1905 the Prince and Princess of Wales undertook another eight-month tour, this time of India, and the children were once again left in the care of their grandparents. They passed through Egypt both ways and on the way back stopped in Greece. The tour was almost immediately followed by a trip to Spain for the wedding of <a href="King%20Alfonso%20XIII">King Alfonso XIII</a> to <a href="Victoria%20Eugenie%20of%20Battenberg">Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</a>, at which the bride and groom narrowly avoided assassination. Only a week after returning to Britain, May and George went to Norway for the coronation of George's brother-in-law and sister, <a href="King%20Haakon%20VII">King Haakon VII</a> and <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Queen Maud</a>.

On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband ascended the throne and she became <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a>. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two official names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring not to be known by the same style as her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the <a href="Delhi%20Durbar">Delhi Durbar</a> held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. 

The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, <a href="Queen%20Alexandra">Queen Alexandra</a>. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, and kept some of the royal jewels that should have been passed to the new queen.

During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Queen Mary instituted an austerity drive at the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After three years of war against <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the <a href="Russian%20Imperial%20Family">Russian Imperial Family</a>, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly in part because the <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar</a>'s wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a>.
Two months after the end of the war, Queen Mary's youngest son, John, died at the age of thirteen. She described her shock and sorrow in her diary and letters, extracts of which were published after her death: "our poor darling little Johnnie had passed away suddenly ... The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind & sympathetic & this has helped us [the King and me] much." 

Her staunch support of her husband continued during the latter half of his reign. She advised him on speeches and used her extensive knowledge of history and royalty to advise him on matters affecting his position. He appreciated her discretion, intelligence, and judgement. She maintained an air of self-assured calm throughout all her public engagements in the years after the war, a period marked by civil unrest over social conditions, <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish independence</a>, and <a href="Indian%20nationalism">Indian nationalism</a>.

In the late 1920s, George V became increasingly ill with lung problems, exacerbated by his heavy smoking. Queen Mary paid particular attention to his care. During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir <a href="Farquhar%20Buzzard">Farquhar Buzzard</a>, was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, "The Queen". In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their <a href="silver%20jubilee">silver jubilee</a>, with celebrations taking place throughout the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. In his jubilee speech, George paid public tribute to his wife, having told his speechwriter, "Put that paragraph at the very end. I cannot trust myself to speak of the Queen when I think of all I owe her."

George V died on 20 January 1936, after his physician, <a href="Bertrand%20Dawson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dawson%20of%20Penn">Lord Dawson of Penn</a>, gave him an injection of <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> that may have hastened his death. Queen Mary's eldest son ascended the throne as Edward VIII. She was now the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a>, though she did not use that style, and was instead known as "Her Majesty Queen Mary".

Within the year, Edward caused a <a href="constitutional%20crisis">constitutional crisis</a> by announcing his desire to marry his twice-divorced American mistress, <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against the teaching of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican church</a>, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, as well as the <a href="British%20Dominions">Dominion</a> governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdicated</a>. 

Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering <a href="Prince%20Albert%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Prince Albert, Duke of York</a>, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British <a href="dowager%20queen">dowager queen</a> to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.

Mary took an interest in the upbringing of her granddaughters, Princesses <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="Princess%20Margaret%2C%20Countess%20of%20Snowdon">Margaret</a>, and took them on various excursions in London, to art galleries and museums. (The princesses' own parents thought it unnecessary for them to be taxed with any demanding educational regime.)

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, George VI wished his mother to be evacuated from London. Although she was reluctant, she decided to live at <a href="Badminton%20House">Badminton House</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, with her niece, <a href="Mary%20Somerset%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Beaufort">Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort</a>, the daughter of her brother <a href="Adolphus%20Cambridge%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Cambridge">Lord Cambridge</a>. Her personal belongings were transported from London in seventy pieces of luggage. Her household, which comprised fifty-five servants, occupied most of the house, except for the Duke and Duchess's private suites, until after the war. The only people to complain about the arrangements were the royal servants, who found the house too small, though Queen Mary annoyed her niece by having the ancient ivy torn from the walls as she considered it unattractive and a hazard. From Badminton, in support of the war effort, she visited troops and factories and directed the gathering of scrap materials. She was known to offer lifts to soldiers she spotted on the roads. In 1942, her youngest surviving son, <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">Prince George, Duke of Kent</a>, was killed in an air crash while on active service. Mary finally returned to <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> in June 1945, after the war in Europe had resulted in the defeat of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

Mary was an eager collector of objects and pictures with a royal connection. She paid above-market estimates when purchasing jewels from the estate of <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dowager Empress Marie of Russia</a> and paid almost three times the estimate when buying the family's Cambridge Emeralds from Lady Kilmorey, the mistress of her late brother <a href="Prince%20Francis%20of%20Teck">Prince Francis</a>. In 1924, the famous architect <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> created <a href="Queen%20Mary%27s%20Dolls%27%20House">Queen Mary's Dolls' House</a> for her collection of miniature pieces. Indeed, she has sometimes been criticised for her aggressive acquisition of "objets d'art" for the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a>. On several occasions, she would express to hosts, or others, that she admired something they had in their possession, in the expectation that the owner would be willing to donate it. Her extensive knowledge of, and research into, the Royal Collection helped in identifying artefacts and artwork that had gone astray over the years. The royal family had lent out many objects over previous generations. Once she had identified unreturned items through old inventories, she would write to the holders, requesting that they be returned. In addition to being an avid collector, Mary was also generous in giving gifts of jewellery, such as presenting her ladies-in-waiting with rings on the occasion of their engagement.

In 1952, King George VI died, the third of Queen Mary's children to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The death of a third child profoundly affected her. Mary remarked to <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Louise%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Princess Marie Louise</a>: "I have lost three sons through death, but I have never been privileged to be there to say a last farewell to them."

Mary died on 24 March 1953 in her sleep at the age of 85, ten weeks before her granddaughter's <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">coronation</a>. Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains <a href="Lying%20in%20State">lay in state</a> at <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin. She is buried beside her husband in the nave of <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>.

Æthelwulf, King of Wessex

Æthelwulf (; <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> for "Noble Wolf"; died 13 January 858) was King of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> from 839 to 858. In 825, his father, King <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a>, defeated King <a href="Beornwulf%20of%20Mercia">Beornwulf</a> of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, ending a long <a href="Mercian%20Supremacy">Mercian dominance</a> over <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a> south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. Egbert sent Æthelwulf with an army to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>, where he expelled the Mercian sub-king and was himself appointed sub-king. After 830, Egbert maintained good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king in 839, the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641.

The <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> were not a major threat to Wessex during Æthelwulf's reign. In 843, he was defeated in a battle against the Vikings at <a href="Carhampton">Carhampton</a> in Somerset, but he achieved a major victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aclea">Battle of Aclea</a> in 851. In 853 he joined a successful Mercian expedition to Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony, and in the same year his daughter <a href="%C3%86thelswith">Æthelswith</a> married King <a href="Burgred%20of%20Mercia">Burgred of Mercia</a>. In 855 Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome. In preparation he gave a "decimation", donating a tenth of his personal property to his subjects; he appointed his eldest surviving son <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald</a> to act as King of Wessex in his absence, and his next son <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht</a> to rule Kent and the south-east. Æthelwulf spent a year in Rome, and on his way back he married <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>, the daughter of the <a href="West%20Frankish">West Frankish</a> King <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>.

When Æthelwulf returned to England, Æthelbald refused to surrender the West Saxon throne, and Æthelwulf agreed to divide the kingdom, taking the east and leaving the west in Æthelbald's hands. On Æthelwulf's death in 858 he left Wessex to Æthelbald and Kent to Æthelberht, but Æthelbald's death only two years later led to the reunification of the kingdom.

In the 20th century Æthelwulf's reputation among historians was poor: he was seen as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage was viewed as a desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is regarded as one of the most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>.

At the beginning of the 9th century, England was almost completely under the control of the Anglo-Saxons, with <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> and <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> the most important southern kingdoms. Mercia was dominant until the 820s, and it exercised overlordship over <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>, but Wessex was able to maintain its independence from its more powerful neighbour. <a href="Offa">Offa</a>, King of Mercia from 757 to 796, was the dominant figure of the second half of the 8th century. King <a href="Beorhtric%20of%20Wessex">Beorhtric</a> of Wessex (786–802), married Offa's daughter in 789. Beorhtric and Offa drove Æthelwulf's father <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a> into exile, and he spent several years at the court of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> in <a href="Francia">Francia</a>. Egbert was the son of <a href="Ealhmund%20of%20Kent">Ealhmund</a>, who had briefly been King of Kent in 784. Following Offa's death, King <a href="Coenwulf%20of%20Mercia">Coenwulf of Mercia</a> (796–821) maintained Mercian dominance, but it is uncertain whether Beorhtric ever accepted political subordination, and when he died in 802 Egbert became king, perhaps with the support of Charlemagne. For two hundred years three kindreds had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Egbert's best claim was that he was the great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a> (688–726), and in 802 it would have seemed very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty.

Almost nothing is recorded of the first twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that the silence of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish <a href="Ealdorman">ealdormen</a> did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop <a href="Wulfred">Wulfred</a> of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been to gain access to the wealth of Kent. His successors <a href="Ceolwulf%20I%20of%20Mercia">Ceolwulf I</a> (821–23) and <a href="Beornwulf%20of%20Mercia">Beornwulf</a> (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, <a href="Baldred%20of%20Kent">Baldred</a>.

England had suffered <a href="Viking">Viking</a> raids in the late 8th century, but no attacks are recorded between 794 and 835, when the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> in Kent was ravaged. In 836 Egbert was defeated by the Vikings at <a href="Carhampton%2C%20Somerset">Carhampton</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hingston%20Down">Battle of Hingston Down</a>, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom.

Æthelwulf was the son of Egbert, King of Wessex from 802 to 839. His mother's name is unknown, and he had no recorded siblings. He is known to have had two wives in succession, and so far as is known, <a href="Osburh">Osburh</a>, the senior of the two, was the mother of all his children. She was the daughter of Oslac, described by <a href="Asser">Asser</a>, biographer of their son <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, as "King Æthelwulf's famous butler", a man who was descended from <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a> who had ruled the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Æthelwulf had six known children. His eldest son, <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20of%20Kent">Æthelstan</a>, was old enough to be appointed King of Kent in 839, so he must have been born by the early 820s, and he died in the early 850s. The second son, <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald</a>, is first recorded as a <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20charters">charter</a> witness in 841, and if, like Alfred, he began to attest when he was around six, he would have been born around 835; he was King of Wessex from 858 to 860. Æthelwulf's third son, <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht</a>, was probably born around 839 and was king from 860 to 865. The only daughter, <a href="%C3%86thelswith">Æthelswith</a>, married <a href="Burgred%20of%20Mercia">Burgred, King of Mercia</a>, in 853. The other two sons were much younger: <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a> was born around 848 and was king from 865 to 871, and Alfred was born around 849 and was king from 871 to 899. In 856 Æthelwulf married <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>, daughter of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, King of <a href="West%20Francia">West Francia</a> and future <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, and his wife <a href="Ermentrude%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Ermentrude</a>. Osburh had probably died, although it is possible that she had been repudiated. There were no children from Æthelwulf's marriage to Judith, and after his death she married his eldest surviving son and successor, Æthelbald.

Æthelwulf was first recorded in 825, when Egbert won the crucial <a href="Battle%20of%20Ellandun">Battle of Ellandun</a> in Wiltshire against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long <a href="Mercian%20Supremacy">Mercian ascendancy</a> over southern England. Egbert followed it up by sending Æthelwulf with <a href="Eahlstan">Eahlstan</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne">Bishop of Sherborne</a>, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. Æthelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sussex">Sussex</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Essex</a>, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop <a href="Beornmod">Beornmod</a> of Rochester, and Æthelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, Æthelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and Æthelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on the attitude of the new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">bishopric of Rochester</a>, and according to the historian of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a> <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a>, Egbert and Æthelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. Æthelwulf seized an estate in <a href="East%20Malling">East Malling</a> from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of <a href="archbishop">archiepiscopal</a> coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King <a href="Wiglaf%20of%20Mercia">Wiglaf of Mercia</a>.

In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia, only for Wiglaf to recover his kingdom a year later. The scholar D. P. Kirby sees Wiglaf's restoration in 830 as a dramatic reversal for Egbert, which was probably followed by his loss of control of the London mint and the Mercian recovery of Essex and Berkshire, and the historian Heather Edwards states that his "immense conquest could not be maintained". However, in the view of Keynes:

In 838 King Egbert held an assembly at <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston</a> in Surrey, where Æthelwulf may have been consecrated as king by the archbishop. Egbert restored the East Malling estate to Wulfred's successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Ceolnoth">Ceolnoth</a>, in return for a promise of "firm and unbroken friendship" for himself and Æthelwulf and their heirs, and the same condition is specified in a grant to the see of Winchester. Egbert thus ensured support for Æthelwulf, who became the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641. At the same meeting Kentish monasteries chose Æthelwulf as their lord, and he undertook that, after his death, they would have freedom to elect their heads. Wulfred had devoted his archiepiscopate to fighting against secular power over Kentish monasteries, but Ceolnoth now surrendered effective control to Æthelwulf, whose offer of freedom from control after his death was unlikely to be honoured by his successors. Kentish ecclesiastics and laymen now looked for protection against Viking attacks to West Saxon rather than Mercian royal power. 

Egbert's conquests brought him wealth far greater than his predecessors had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.

When Æthelwulf succeeded to the throne of Wessex in 839, his experience as sub-king of Kent had given him valuable training in kingship, and he in turn made his own sons sub-kings. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", on his accession "he gave to his son Æthelstan the kingdom of the people of Kent, and the kingdom of the East Saxons [Essex] and of the people of Surrey and of the South Saxons [Sussex]". However, Æthelwulf did not give Æthelstan the same power as his father had given him, and although Æthelstan attested his father's charters as king, he does not appear to have been given the power to issue his own charters. Æthelwulf exercised authority in the south-east and made regular visits there. He governed Wessex and Kent as separate spheres, and assemblies in each kingdom were only attended by the nobility of that country. The historian <a href="Janet%20Nelson">Janet Nelson</a> says that "Æthelwulf ran a <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian</a>-style family firm of plural realms, held together by his own authority as father-king, and by the consent of distinct élites." He maintained his father's policy of governing Kent through ealdormen appointed from the local nobility and advancing their interests, but gave less support to the church. In 843 Æthelwulf granted ten hides at <a href="Little%20Chart">Little Chart</a> to Æthelmod, the brother of the leading Kentish ealdorman Ealhere, and Æthelmod succeeded to the post on his brother's death in 853. In 844 Æthelwulf granted land at <a href="Chartham%23Horton">Horton</a> in Kent to Ealdorman Eadred, with permission to transfer parts of it to local landowners; in a culture of reciprocity, this created a network of mutual friendships and obligations between the beneficiaries and the king. Archbishops of Canterbury were firmly in the West Saxon king's sphere. His ealdormen enjoyed a high status, and were sometimes placed higher than the king's sons in lists of witnesses to charters. His reign is the first for which there is evidence of royal priests, and <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a> regarded him as an important benefactor, who is said to have been the donor of a shrine for the relics of <a href="Aldhelm">Saint Aldhelm</a>.

After 830, Egbert had followed a policy of maintaining good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king. London was traditionally a Mercian town, but in the 830s it was under West Saxon control; soon after Æthelwulf's accession it reverted to Mercian control. King Wiglaf of Mercia died in 839 and his successor, <a href="Beorhtwulf%20of%20Mercia">Berhtwulf</a>, revived the Mercian mint in London; the two kingdoms appear to have struck a joint issue in the mid-840s, possibly indicating West Saxon help in reviving Mercian coinage, and showing the friendly relations between the two powers. Berkshire was still Mercian in 844, but by 849 it was part of Wessex, as Alfred was born in that year at the West Saxon royal estate in <a href="Wantage">Wantage</a>, then in Berkshire. However, the local Mercian ealdorman, also called <a href="%C3%86thelwulf%20of%20Berkshire">Æthelwulf</a>, retained his position under the West Saxon kings. Berhtwulf died in 852 and cooperation with Wessex continued under Burgred, his successor as King of Mercia, who married Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith in 853. In the same year Æthelwulf assisted Burgred in a successful attack on Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony over the Welsh.

In 9th-century Mercia and Kent, royal charters were produced by religious houses, each with its own style, but in Wessex there was a single royal diplomatic tradition, probably by a single agency acting for the king. This may have originated in Egbert's reign, and it becomes clear in the 840s, when Æthelwulf had a Frankish secretary called Felix. There were strong contacts between the West Saxon and Carolingian courts. The <a href="Annals%20of%20St%20Bertin">Annals of St Bertin</a> took particular interest in Viking attacks on Britain, and in 852 <a href="Lupus%20Servatus">Lupus</a>, the Abbot of <a href="Ferri%C3%A8res%20Abbey">Ferrières</a> and a protégé of Charles the Bald, wrote to Æthelwulf congratulating him on his victory over the Vikings and requesting a gift of lead to cover his church roof. Lupus also wrote to his "most beloved friend" Felix, asking him to manage the transport of the lead. Unlike Canterbury and the south-east, Wessex did not see a sharp decline in the standard of Latin in charters in the mid-9th century, and this may have been partly due to Felix and his continental contacts. Lupus thought that Felix had great influence over the King. Charters were mainly issued from royal estates in counties which were the heartland of ancient Wessex, namely Hampshire, Somerset, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, with a few in Kent.

An ancient division between east and west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was <a href="Selwood%20Forest">Selwood Forest</a> on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a> in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed <a href="Swithun">Swithun</a> to succeed <a href="Helmstan">Helmstan</a> as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in <a href="South%20Hams">South Hams</a> in west Devon. He thus changed it from <a href="royal%20demesne">royal demesne</a>, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to <a href="Bookland%20%28law%29">bookland</a>, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.

Viking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at <a href="Carhampton">Carhampton</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. In 850 sub-king Æthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere of Kent won a naval victory over a large Viking fleet off <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a> in Kent, capturing nine ships and driving off the rest. Æthelwulf granted Ealhhere a large estate in Kent, but Æthelstan is not heard of again, and probably died soon afterwards. The following year the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" records five different attacks on southern England. A Danish fleet of 350 Viking ships took London and Canterbury, and when King Berhtwulf of Mercia went to their relief he was defeated. The Vikings then moved on to Surrey, where they were defeated by Æthelwulf and his son Æthelbald at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aclea">Battle of Aclea</a>. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" the West Saxon levies "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen that we have heard tell of up to the present day". The "Chronicle" frequently reported victories during Æthelwulf's reign won by levies led by ealdormen, unlike the 870s when royal command was emphasised, reflecting a more consensual style of leadership in the earlier period.

In 850 a Danish army wintered on <a href="Isle%20of%20Thanet">Thanet</a>, and in 853 ealdormen Ealhhere of Kent and Huda of Surrey were killed in a battle against the Vikings, also on Thanet. In 855 Danish Vikings stayed over the winter on Sheppey, before carrying on their pillaging of eastern England. However, during Æthelwulf's reign Viking attacks were contained and did not present a major threat.

The <a href="silver%20penny">silver penny</a> was almost the only coin used in middle and later Anglo-Saxon England. Æthelwulf's coinage came from a main mint in Canterbury and a secondary one at Rochester; both had been used by Egbert for his own coinage after he gained control of Kent. During Æthelwulf's reign, there were four main phases of the coinage distinguishable at both mints, though they are not exactly parallel and it is uncertain when the transitions took place. The first issue at Canterbury carried a design known as "Saxoniorum", which had been used by Egbert for one of his own issues. This was replaced by a portrait design in about 843, which can be subdivided further; the earliest coins have cruder designs than the later ones. At the Rochester mint the sequence was reversed, with an initial portrait design replaced, also in about 843, by a non-portrait design carrying a cross-and-wedges pattern on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>.

In about 848 both mints switched to a common design known as Dor¯b¯/Cant – the characters "Dor¯b¯" on the obverse of these coins indicate either "Dorobernia" (Canterbury) or "Dorobrevia" (Rochester), and "Cant", referring to Kent, appeared on the reverse. It is possible that the Canterbury mint continued to produce portrait coins at the same time. The Canterbury issue seems to have been ended in 850–851 by Viking raids, though it is possible that Rochester was spared, and the issue may have continued there. The final issue, again at both mints, was introduced in about 852; it has an inscribed cross on the reverse and a portrait on the obverse. Æthelwulf's coinage became <a href="debasement">debased</a> by the end of his reign, and though the problem became worse after his death it is possible that the debasement prompted the changes in coin type from as early as 850.

Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage may have begun when he was still sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of coins deposited at the beginning of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a> in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some <a href="Numismatics">numismatists</a> argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.

Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury throughout Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins of his own at Canterbury: there were three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary with each of the first three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was uniform with Æthelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod produced only one issue, a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with Æthelwulf's "Saxoniorum" issue.

In the view of the numismatists <a href="Philip%20Grierson">Philip Grierson</a> and <a href="Mark%20Blackburn%20%28numismatist%29">Mark Blackburn</a>, the mints of Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia were not greatly affected by changes in political control: "the remarkable continuity of moneyers which can be seen at each of these mints suggests that the actual mint organisation was largely independent of the royal administration and was founded in the stable trading communities of each city".

The early 20th-century historian <a href="W.%20H.%20Stevenson">W. H. Stevenson</a> observed that: "Few things in our early history have led to so much discussion" as Æthelwulf's Decimation Charters; a hundred years later the charter expert Susan Kelly described them as "one of the most controversial groups of Anglo-Saxon diplomas". Both Asser and the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" say that Æthelwulf gave a decimation, in 855, shortly before leaving on pilgrimage to Rome. According to the "Chronicle" "King Æthelwulf conveyed by charter the tenth part of his land throughout all his kingdom to the praise of God and to his own eternal salvation". However, Asser states that "Æthelwulf, the esteemed king, freed the tenth part of his whole kingdom from royal service and tribute, and as an everlasting inheritance he made it over on the cross of Christ to the <a href="Trinity">triune</a> God, for the redemption of his soul and those of his predecessors." According to Keynes, Asser's version may just be a "loose translation" of the "Chronicle", and his implication that Æthelwulf released a tenth of all land from secular burdens was probably not intended. All land could be regarded as the king's land, so the "Chronicle" reference to "his land" does not necessarily refer to royal property, and since the booking of land – conveying it by charter – was always regarded as a pious act, Asser's statement that he made it over to God does not necessarily mean that the charters were in favour of the church.

The Decimation Charters are divided by Susan Kelly into four groups:


None of the charters are original, and Stevenson dismissed all of them as fraudulent apart from the Kentish one of 855. Stevenson saw the decimation as a donation of royal demesne to churches and laymen, with those grants which were made to laymen being on the understanding that there would be reversion to a religious institution. Up to the 1990s, his view on the authenticity of the charters was generally accepted by scholars, with the exception of the historian <a href="H.%20P.%20R.%20Finberg">H. P. R. Finberg</a>, who argued in 1964 that most are based on authentic diplomas. Finberg coined the terms the 'First Decimation' of 844, which he saw as the removal of public dues on a tenth of all bookland, and the 'Second Decimation' of 854, the donation of a tenth of "the private domain of the royal house" to the churches. He considered it unlikely that the First Decimation had been carried into effect, probably due to the threat from the Vikings. Finberg's terminology has been adopted, but his defence of the First Decimation generally rejected. In 1994, Keynes defended the Wilton charters in group 2, and his arguments have been widely accepted.

Historians have been divided on how to interpret the Second Decimation, and in 1994 Keynes described it as "one of the most perplexing problems" in the study of 9th-century charters. He set out three alternatives:


Some scholars, for example <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a>, author of the standard history of Anglo-Saxon England, along with Keynes and Abels, see the Second Decimation as a donation of royal demesne. In Abels' view Æthelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an "avid attention" in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that "Æthelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings", and the mid-20th-century historian <a href="Eric%20John">Eric John</a> observes that "a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as when he was on his knees". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Smyth">Alfred P. Smyth</a>, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that Æthelwulf freed a tenth part of land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it "is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a partial remission of royal dues". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms.

Kelly argues that most charters were based on genuine originals, including the First Decimation of 844. She says: "Commentators have been unkind [and] the 844 version has not been given the benefit of the doubt". In her view Æthelwulf then gave a 10% tax reduction on bookland, and ten years later he took the more generous step of "a widespread distribution of royal lands". Unlike Finberg, she believes that both decimations were carried out, although the second one may not have been completed due to opposition from Æthelwulf's son Æthelbald. She thinks that the grants of bookland to laymen in the Second Decimation were unconditional, not with reversion to religious houses as Stevenson had argued. However, Keynes is not convinced by Kelly's arguments, and thinks that the First Decimation charters were 11th or early 12th century fabrications.

In the early 850s Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome. According to Abels: "Æthelwulf was at the height of his power and prestige. It was a propitious time for the West Saxon king to claim a place of honour among the kings and emperors of <a href="christendom">christendom</a>." His eldest surviving sons Æthelbald and Æthelberht were then adults, while Æthelred and Alfred were still young children. In 853 Æthelwulf sent his younger sons to Rome, perhaps accompanying envoys in connection with his own forthcoming visit. Alfred, and possibly Æthelred as well, were invested with the "belt of consulship". Æthelred's part in the journey is only known from a contemporary record in the "<a href="Confraternity%20book">liber vitae</a>" of <a href="San%20Salvatore%2C%20Brescia">San Salvatore</a>, <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>, as later records such as the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" were only interested in recording the honour paid to Alfred. Abels sees the embassy as paving the way for Æthelwulf's pilgrimage, and the presence of Alfred, his youngest and therefore most expendable son, as a gesture of goodwill to the papacy; <a href="confirmation">confirmation</a> by <a href="Pope%20Leo%20IV">Pope Leo IV</a> made Alfred his spiritual son, and thus created a spiritual link between the two "fathers". Kirby argues that the journey may indicate that Alfred was intended for the church, while Nelson on the contrary sees Æthelwulf's purpose as affirming his younger sons' throneworthiness, thus protecting them against being <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>d by their elder brothers, which would have rendered them ineligible for kingship.

Æthelwulf set out for Rome in the spring of 855, accompanied by Alfred and a large retinue. The King left Wessex in the care of his oldest surviving son, Æthelbald, and the sub-kingdom of Kent to the rule of Æthelberht, and thereby confirmed that they were to succeed to the two kingdoms. On the way the party stayed with <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a> in Francia, where there were the usual banquets and exchange of gifts. Æthelwulf stayed a year in Rome, and his gifts to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rome">Diocese of Rome</a> included a gold crown weighing , two gold goblets, a sword bound with gold, four silver-gilt bowls, two silk tunics and two gold-interwoven veils. He also gave gold to the clergy and leading men and silver to the people of Rome. According to the historian Joanna Story, his gifts rivalled those of Carolingian donors and the Byzantine emperor and "were clearly chosen to reflect the personal generosity and spiritual wealth of the West Saxon king; here was no Germanic 'hillbilly' from the backwoods of the Christian world but, rather, a sophisticated, wealthy and utterly contemporary monarch". According to the 12th-century chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, he helped to pay for the restoration of the <a href="Schola%20Saxonum">Saxon quarter</a>, which had recently been destroyed by fire, for English pilgrims.

The pilgrimage puzzles historians and Kelly comments that "it is extraordinary that an early medieval king could consider his position safe enough to abandon his kingdom in a time of extreme crisis". She suggests that Æthelwulf may have been motivated by a personal religious impulse. Ryan sees it as an attempt to placate the divine wrath displayed by Viking attacks, whereas Nelson thinks he aimed to enhance his prestige in dealing with the demands of his adult sons. In Kirby's view:

On his way back from Rome Æthelwulf again stayed with King Charles the Bald, and may have joined him on a campaign against a Viking warband. On 1 October 856 Æthelwulf married Charles's daughter, Judith, aged 12 or 13, at <a href="Verberie">Verberie</a>. The marriage was considered extraordinary by contemporaries and by modern historians. Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, and it was almost unknown for them to marry foreigners. Judith was crowned queen and <a href="anoint">anoint</a>ed by <a href="Hincmar">Hincmar</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rheims">Archbishop of Rheims</a>. Although empresses had been anointed before, this is the first definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. In addition West Saxon custom, described by Asser as "perverse and detestable", was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband – she was just the king's wife.

Æthelwulf returned to Wessex to face a revolt by Æthelbald, who attempted to prevent his father from recovering his throne. Historians give varying explanations for both the rebellion and the marriage. In Nelson's view, Æthelwulf's marriage to Judith added the West Saxon king to the family of kings and princely allies which Charles was creating. Charles was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and Æthelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings; some historians such as Kirby and <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a> see the marriage as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. The marriage gave Æthelwulf a share in Carolingian prestige, and Kirby describes the anointing of Judith as "a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring." These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of Æthelwulf's kingdom, and explain Æthelbald's decision to rebel. The historian Michael Enright denies that an anti-Viking alliance between two such distant kingdoms could serve any useful purpose, and argues that the marriage was Æthelwulf's response to news that his son was planning to rebel; his son by an anointed Carolingian queen would be in a strong position to succeed as king of Wessex instead of the rebellious Æthelbald. Abels suggests that Æthelwulf sought Judith's hand because he needed her father's money and support to overcome his son's rebellion, but Kirby and Smyth argue that it is extremely unlikely that Charles the Bald would have agreed to marry his daughter to a ruler who was known to be in serious political difficulty. Æthelbald may also have acted out of resentment at the loss of patrimony he suffered as a result of the decimation.

Æthelbald's rebellion was supported by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though they appear to have been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think it is more likely that it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should sit beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".
King Æthelwulf's ring was found in a cart rut in <a href="Laverstock%20and%20Ford">Laverstock</a> in Wiltshire in about August 1780 by one William Petty, who sold it to a silversmith in <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a>. The silversmith sold it to the <a href="Jacob%20Pleydell-Bouverie%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Radnor">Earl of Radnor</a>, and the earl's son, <a href="William%20Pleydell-Bouverie%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Radnor">William</a>, donated it to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1829. The ring, together with a similar ring of Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith, is one of two key examples of <a href="niello">niello</a>ed 9th-century metalwork. They appear to represent the emergence of a "court style" of West Saxon metalwork, characterised by an unusual Christian iconography, such as a pair of peacocks at the <a href="Fountain%20of%20Life">Fountain of Life</a> on the Æthelwulf ring, associated with Christian immortality. The ring is inscribed "Æthelwulf Rex", firmly associating it with the King, and the inscription forms part of the design, so it cannot have been added later. Many of its features are typical of 9th-century metalwork, such as the design of two birds, beaded and speckled borders, and a <a href="saltire">saltire</a> with arrow-like terminals on the back. It was probably manufactured in Wessex, but was typical of the uniformity of animal ornament in England in the 9th century. In the view of <a href="Leslie%20Webster%20%28art%20historian%29">Leslie Webster</a>, an expert on medieval art: "Its fine <a href="Trewhiddle%23The%20Trewhiddle%20Hoard">Trewhiddle style</a> ornament would certainly fit a mid ninth-century date." In Nelson's view, "it was surely made to be a gift from this royal lord to a brawny follower: the sign of a successful ninth-century kingship". The art historian David Wilson sees it as a survival of the pagan tradition of the generous king as the "ring-giver".

Æthelwulf's will has not survived, but Alfred's has and it provides some information about his father's intentions. The kingdom was to be divided between the two oldest surviving sons, with Æthelbald getting Wessex and Æthelberht getting Kent and the south-east. The survivor of Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred was to inherit their father's bookland – his personal property as opposed to the royal lands which went with the kingship – and Abels and Yorke argue that this probably means that the survivor was to inherit the throne of Wessex as well. Other historians disagree. Nelson states that the provision regarding the personal property had nothing to do with the kingship, and Kirby comments: "Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife. With three older brothers, Alfred's chances of reaching adulthood would, one feels, have been minimal." Æthelwulf's moveable wealth, such as gold and silver, was to be divided between "children, nobles and the needs of the king's soul". For the latter, he left one tenth of his hereditary land to be set aside to feed the poor, and he ordered that three hundred <a href="mancus">mancus</a>es be sent to Rome each year, one hundred to be spent on lighting the lamps in <a href="Old%20St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St Peter's</a> at Easter, one hundred for the lights of <a href="Basilica%20of%20Saint%20Paul%20Outside%20the%20Walls">St Paul's</a>, and one hundred for the pope.

Æthelwulf died on 13 January 858. According to the <a href="Annals%20of%20St%20Neots">Annals of St Neots</a>, he was buried at <a href="Steyning">Steyning</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, but his body was later transferred to <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, probably by Alfred. Æthelwulf was succeeded by Æthelbald in Wessex and Æthelberht in Kent and the south-east. The prestige conferred by a Frankish marriage was so great that Æthelbald then wedded his step-mother Judith, to Asser's retrospective horror; he described the marriage as a "great disgrace", and "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity". When Æthelbald died only two years later, Æthelberht became King of Wessex as well as Kent, and Æthelwulf's intention of dividing his kingdoms between his sons was thus set aside. In the view of Yorke and Abels this was because Æthelred and Alfred were too young to rule, and Æthelberht agreed in return that his younger brothers would inherit the whole kingdom on his death, whereas Kirby and Nelson think that Æthelberht just became the trustee for his younger brothers' share of the bookland.

After Æthelbald's death Judith sold her possessions and returned to her father, but two years later she eloped with <a href="Baldwin%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin, Count of Flanders</a>. In the 890s their son, also called <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin</a>, married Æthelwulf's granddaughter <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20Countess%20of%20Flanders">Ælfthryth</a>.

Æthelwulf's reputation among historians was poor in the twentieth century. In 1935, the historian <a href="Robert%20Howard%20Hodgkin">R. H. Hodgkin</a> attributed his pilgrimage to Rome to "the unpractical piety which had led him to desert his kingdom at a time of great danger", and described his marriage to Judith as "the folly of a man senile before his time". To Stenton in the 1960s he was "a religious and unambitious man, for whom engagement in war and politics was an unwelcome consequence of rank". One dissenter was Finberg, who in 1964 described him as "a king whose valour in war and princely munificence recalled the figures of the heroic age", but in 1979 Enright said: "More than anything else he appears to have been an impractical religious enthusiast." Early medieval writers, especially Asser, emphasise his religiosity and his preference for consensus, seen in the concessions made to avert a civil war on his return from Rome. In Story's view "his legacy has been clouded by accusations of excessive piety which (to modern sensibilities at least) has seemed at odds with the demands of early medieval kingship". In 839 an unnamed Anglo-Saxon king wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> asking for permission to travel through his territory on the way to Rome, and relating an English priest's dream which foretold disaster unless Christians abandoned their sins. This is now believed to have been an unrealised project of Egbert at the end of his life, but it was formerly attributed to Æthelwulf, and seen as exhibiting what Story calls his reputation for "dramatic piety", and irresponsibility for planning to abandon his kingdom at the beginning of his reign.

In the twenty-first century he is seen very differently by historians. Æthelwulf is not listed in the index of <a href="Peter%20Hunter%20Blair">Peter Hunter Blair</a>'s "An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England", first published in 1956, but in a new introduction to the 2003 edition Keynes listed him among people "who have not always been accorded the attention they might be thought to deserve ... for it was he, more than any other, who secured the political fortune of his people in the ninth century, and who opened up channels of communication which led through Frankish realms and across the Alps to Rome". According to Story: "Æthelwulf acquired and cultivated a reputation both in Francia and Rome which is unparalleled in the sources since the height of Offa's and Coenwulf's power at the turn of the ninth century".

Nelson describes him as "one of the great underrated among Anglo-Saxons", and complains that she was only allowed 2,500 words for him in the <a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>, compared with 15,000 for <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> and 35,000 for <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>.

Æthelbald, King of Wessex

Æthelbald, King of Wessex (died 860) was the second of five sons of King <a href="%C3%86thelwulf%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwulf of Wessex</a>. In 850 Æthelbald's elder brother <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20of%20Kent">Æthelstan</a> defeated the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> in the first recorded sea battle in English history, but he is not recorded afterwards and probably died in the early 850s. The next year Æthelwulf and Æthelbald inflicted another defeat on the Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aclea">Battle of Aclea</a>. In 855 Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and he appointed Æthelbald king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, while <a href="%C3%86thelberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht</a>, the next oldest son, became King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>, which had been conquered by Wessex thirty years earlier. When Æthelwulf returned to England in 856, Æthelbald refused to give up the crown. Most historians believe that Æthelbald continued to be king of Wessex while Æthelberht gave up Kent to his father, but some scholars think that Wessex itself was divided, with Æthelbald ruling the west and his father the east, while Æthelberht kept Kent. When Æthelwulf died, in 858 Æthelbald continued as (or became again) king of Wessex and his <a href="%C3%86thelberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">brother</a> resumed (or carried on) his kingship of Kent.

On his way back from Rome, Æthelwulf stayed for several months with <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, <a href="King%20of%20the%20Franks">King of the Franks</a> and married Charles' twelve-year-old daughter, <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>. After Æthelwulf's death Æthelbald married his stepmother, to the later horror of <a href="Asser">Asser</a>, the biographer of his youngest brother, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. Asser denounced the union as being "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans", but the marriage does not appear to have been condemned at the time. Æthelbald and Æthelberht appear to have been on good terms: when Æthelbald died in 860 Æthelberht became king of both Wessex and Kent, and they were never again divided.

When Æthelbald's grandfather <a href="Ecgberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Ecgberht</a> became king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> in 802, it would have seemed very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Ecgberht's nearest connection to a king of Wessex was as a great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a> (688–726), but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of <a href="Cerdic">Cerdic</a>, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty, which made him an ætheling, a prince who had a legitimate claim to the throne. But in the ninth and tenth centuries Ecgberht's line controlled the kingdom, and all kings were sons of kings.

At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>s, and the Midland kingdom of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> dominated southern England. In 825 Ecgberht decisively defeated the Mercians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ellendun">Battle of Ellendun</a>, ending Mercian supremacy. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to <a href="Viking">Viking</a> attacks. In 835 the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> in Kent was ravaged. In 836 Ecgberht was defeated by the Vikings at <a href="Carhampton%2C%20Somerset">Carhampton</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of <a href="Cornishmen">Cornishmen</a> and Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hingston%20Down">Battle of Hingston Down</a>, reducing Cornwall to the status of a <a href="client%20kingdom">client kingdom</a>. He died in the following year and was succeeded by his son <a href="%C3%86thelwulf">Æthelwulf</a>, who appointed his eldest son <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20of%20Kent">Æthelstan</a> as sub-king of Kent, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Surrey">Surrey</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sussex">Sussex</a>, in the same year.

Æthelbald was the second son of King Æthelwulf and probably of his first wife <a href="Osburh">Osburh</a>, who was the mother of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. As Æthelstan was old enough to be appointed king ten years before Alfred was born in 849, and Æthelbald took part in battle in 851, some historians argue that it is more likely that the elder children were born to an unrecorded earlier wife. Æthelstan died before his father, but Æthelbald and his three younger brothers were successively kings of Wessex: Æthelbald reigned from 855 to 860, <a href="%C3%86thelberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht</a> reigned from 860 to 865, <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred I</a> reigned from 865 to 871 and Alfred the Great reigned from 871 to 899. Æthelbald is first recorded when he witnessed a charter of his father (S 290) in 840 as "filius regis" (the king's son). He attested with the same designation in the 840s, to S 300 in 850 as "dux filius regis" and in the early 850s as "dux" (<a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a>). In 850 his elder brother Æthelstan defeated a Danish fleet off <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a> in the first recorded naval battle in English history, but he is not recorded thereafter, and probably died soon afterwards. In 851 Æthelwulf and Æthelbald defeated the Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aclea">Battle of Aclea</a> and, according to the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", "we have never heard of a greater slaughter of them, in any region, on any one day, before or since". At Easter in 854 Æthelbald and his younger brother Æthelberht attested charters as "dux", and in 855 their father went on pilgrimage to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and appointed Æthelbald as king of Wessex while Æthelberht became king of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex.

Æthelwulf spent a year in Rome. On his way back he stayed for several months with <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, King of the <a href="West%20Franks">West Franks</a>, and married Charles' twelve-year-old daughter <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>; the <a href="bishop%20of%20Rheims">bishop of Rheims</a> ceremonially consecrated her and Æthelwulf conferred the title of queen on her. Æthelwulf returned with his new wife in October 856, and according to Alfred the Great's biographer, Bishop <a href="Asser">Asser</a>, during his absence a plot was hatched to prevent the king's return and keep Æthelbald on the throne. Asser regarded it as "a terrible crime: expelling the king from his own kingdom; but God did not allow it to happen, nor would the nobles of the whole Saxon land have any part in it". Asser stated that a great many men said that the initiative for "this wretched incident, unheard of in all previous ages" came from Æthelbald's chief counsellors, <a href="Eahlstan">Eahlstan</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Sherborne</a> and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, who had been two of Æthelwulf's most senior advisers, while many blamed Æthelbald himself.

Historians give varying explanations for both the marriage and the rebellion. D. P. Kirby and <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a> see the match as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. Another factor was that Judith was a great-granddaughter of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, and union with her gave Æthelwulf a share in <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> prestige. Kirby describes her anointing as "a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring." These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of Æthelwulf's kingdom, and explain Æthelbald's decision to rebel. He may also have feared that he would be disadvantaged if his father returned to rule Wessex while his brother kept Kent. Michael Enright argues that an alliance against the Vikings between such distant territories would have served no useful purpose. He sees the marriage as following Æthelbald's rebellion and being a response to it, intending that a son of Judith would displace Æthelbald as successor to the throne. <a href="Janet%20Nelson">Janet Nelson</a> goes further, seeing Æthelwulf's pilgrimage as intended from the start to enhance his prestige to assist him in facing down filial resentments. Kirby and Sean Miller argue that it is unlikely that Charles would have agreed to his daughter being taken to a country in a state of civil war, so Æthelbald's revolt was probably a response to the marriage, which threatened to produce sons who had a stronger claim to the throne than he had. <a href="Richard%20Abels">Richard Abels</a> argues that Æthelbald probably hoped that his rule would be permanent: "All knew the dangers that attended a pilgrimage to Rome and were aware of the possibility that Æthelwulf would not return. His departure to Rome all but invited the prowling of hungry æthelings." Charles may have agreed to the marriage because he was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and Æthelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings. The marriage added the West Saxon king to the network of royal and princely allies that Charles was creating.

Rivalry between east and west Wessex may have also been a factor in the dispute. The ancient <a href="Selwood%20Forest">Selwood Forest</a> marked the boundary between the bishoprics of <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Sherborne</a> in the west and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a> in the east. In the eighth century, the connections of Ecgberht's family were with the west, but in the early ninth century, the family became close to the clergy of Winchester, who helped them to establish an exclusive hold on the throne for their royal branch. According to Asser, the plot to rob Æthelwulf of his throne was concocted in "the western part of Selwood", and Æthelbald's chief supporters, Eahlstan and Eanwulf, were western magnates who probably resented the favour shown by Æthelwulf to the eastern Winchester diocese, and to <a href="Swithun">Swithun</a>, who was appointed by Æthelwulf as Bishop of Winchester in 852. Æthelbald's patronage was mainly directed at Sherborne.
Asser is the sole source for the dispute between Æthelwulf and Æthelbald, which is not mentioned in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", and according to Asser when Æthelwulf returned to England he agreed to divide the kingdom to avoid a civil war. Most historians state that Æthelbald kept Wessex while Æthelberht agreed to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to Æthelwulf, although <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> thinks that Æthelwulf kept a degree of sovereignty. Some historians argue that it is more likely that Wessex itself was divided, with Æthelbald keeping his power base west of Selwood, Æthelwulf taking the east and Æthelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby point out that Asser implies that Judith became queen of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller observes that Asser complained that the "son ruled where by rightful judgment the father should have done; for the western part of the Saxon land has always been more important than the eastern", and since Kent had only been conquered thirty years previously, it did not make sense to speak of it as having always been a less important part of the kingdom.

According to Asser, at the end of his life, Æthelwulf directed that his kingdom should be divided between his two eldest sons, and this was carried out when he died on 13 January 858. Æthelbald then continued (or resumed) as king of Wessex, while Æthelberht resumed (or kept) the kingship of Kent and the south-east. Æthelwulf left a bequest to Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, with the provision that whoever lived the longest was to inherit the whole; this is seen by some historians as leaving the kingship of Wessex to the survivor, but other historians dispute this and it may have been intended to provide for the younger sons. Judith's charisma as a Carolingian princess was so great that rather than lose the prestige of the connection Æthelbald then married her. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" ignores the marriage, perhaps because mentioning such a prestigious connection of Alfred's older brother would have detracted from its focus on the achievements of Alfred himself. Æthelbald's marriage to his widowed stepmother was subsequently condemned by Asser as "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans", although it does not appear to have aroused opposition at the time. The Frankish "<a href="Annals%20of%20St%20Bertin">Annals of St Bertin</a>" reported the marriage without comment, and stated that when she returned to her father after Æthelbald's death, Judith was treated "with all the honour due to a queen". To her father's fury, soon afterwards she eloped with <a href="Baldwin%20I%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin, Count of Flanders</a>, and their son <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin II</a> married Alfred's daughter <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20Countess%20of%20Flanders">Ælfthryth</a>.

Little is known of Æthelbald's reign and only two of his charters survive. S 1274 dated 858 is a grant by Swithun of an episcopal estate at <a href="Farnham">Farnham</a> to the king for his lifetime, and in <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a>'s view it is an example of Æthelbald's confiscations of the bishop of Winchester's estates for his own use. S 326 dated 860 is a grant by Æthelbald of fourteen <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a> at <a href="Teffont">Teffont</a> in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> to a <a href="thegn">thegn</a> called Osmund. Both are attested by Judith, an indication of her high status as ninth-century West Saxon kings' wives were not normally given the rank of queen and almost never witnessed charters. The marriage and attestations are evidence that Æthelbald intended the succession to pass to his own son, not his brothers. S 326 is also attested by King Æthelberht, suggesting that he was on good terms with his brother. S 1274 is the earliest surviving West Saxon charter to require a contribution to fortification work, and Nelson suggests that Judith's entourage may have been responsible for the innovation. A few years later Charles the Bald began a programme of rebuilding town walls and building new fortresses in West Francia.
No coins are known to have been issued in the name of Æthelbald. The main mints in southern England were both in Kent, at <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a>. They minted coins in the name of Æthelwulf until 858 and then in the name of Æthelberht. There was one mint in Wessex, probably at <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> or <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, but it operated at a minimal level in the mid-ninth century and only three coins from it between 839 and 871 are known, two of Æthelwulf and one of Æthelred I, all produced by the same moneyer. The fact that the Kentish mints produced coins only for Æthelberht between 858 and 860 is evidence that Æthelbald was not his brother's overlord. Three coins of Æthelbald were regarded as genuine in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1900s they were found to be forgeries.

Æthelbald died in 860 and the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" gives him a reign of five years, dating the start to 855 when Æthelwulf left for Rome. Both Asser and the "<a href="Annals%20of%20St%20Neots">Annals of St Neots</a>" give Æthelbald a rule of two and a half years, and the "Annals" adds that he also ruled for two and a half years jointly with his father. Most modern historians date his reign as 855 to 860, but some as 858 to 860. Only the year of his death is known, but as his father died in January 858 and he ruled for two and a half years thereafter, he probably died in about July 860. He was buried at Sherborne in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> and he is not known to have had any children.

He was succeeded by Æthelberht, who re-united Wessex and Kent under his rule. It is not clear whether the division between Wessex and Kent had been intended to be permanent, but if so Æthelbald's early death allowed Æthelberht to reverse the division and Kent and the south-east were thereafter treated as an integral part of Wessex.

In the 890s, Bishop Asser gave the only surviving contemporary assessment of Æthelbald. Asser, who was hostile to him both because of his revolt against his father and because of his uncanonical marriage, described him as "iniquitous and grasping" and his reign as "two and a half lawless years", adding that many people attributed the rebellion "solely to arrogance on the part of King Æthelbald, because he was grasping in this affair and many other wrongdoings". Post-<a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Conquest</a> clerical chroniclers adopted Asser's views. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> wrote that "Æthelbald, who was worthless and disloyal to his father, defiled his father's marriage-bed, for after his father's death he sank so low as to marry his stepmother Judith." According to <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>, "Æthelbald, in defiance of God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and even against all pagan customs, climbed into his father's marriage-bed, married Judith, daughter of Charles, king of the Franks, and held the government of the kingdom of the West Saxons without restraint for two and half years after his father's death". <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> condemned Æthelbald in similar terms, but claimed that in 859 he repented of his error, put aside Judith and ruled thereafter "in peace and righteousness". The exception was <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, who stated that Æthelbald and Æthelberht, "young men of superlative natural quality, possessed their kingdoms very prosperously as long as they each lived. When Æthelbald, King of Wessex, had held his kingdom peacefully for five years, he was carried off by a premature death. All England lamented King Æthelbald's youth and there was great sorrow over him. And they buried him at Sherborne. After this England was conscious of what it had lost in him."

<a href="Robert%20Howard%20Hodgkin">Robert Howard Hodgkin</a> also adopted Asser's views in his 1935 "History of the Anglo-Saxons", but later historians have been more circumspect. <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> in "Anglo-Saxon England" does not give any opinion on Æthelbald, and observes that his marriage to Judith does not appear to have aroused any scandal among the churchmen of her country, while Sean Miller in his "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>" article on Æthelbald says that very little is known of his reign after his marriage, but he appears to have been on good terms with Æthelberht.

Æthelberht, King of Wessex

Æthelberht (or Ethelbert or Aethelberht) was the King of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> from 860 until his death in 865. He was the third son of King <a href="%C3%86thelwulf">Æthelwulf</a> and his first wife, <a href="Osburh">Osburh</a>. Æthelberht was first recorded as a witness to a charter in 854. The following year Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed his oldest surviving son, <a href="%C3%86thelbald%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald</a>, as king of Wessex while Æthelberht became king of the recently conquered territory of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>. Æthelberht may have surrendered his position to his father when he returned from pilgrimage, but resumed (or kept) the south-eastern kingship when his father died in 858. 

When Æthelbald died in 860, Æthelberht united both their territories under his rule. He did not appoint a sub-king and Wessex and Kent were fully united for the first time. He appears to have been on good terms with his younger brothers, the future kings <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred I</a> and <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. The kingdom came under attack from Viking raids during his reign, but these were minor compared with the invasions after his death. Æthelberht died in the autumn of 865 and was buried next to his brother Æthelbald at <a href="Sherborne%20Abbey">Sherborne Abbey</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. He was succeeded by Æthelred.

When Æthelberht's grandfather <a href="Ecgberht%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Ecgberht</a> became king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> in 802, it must have appeared very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Ecgberht's nearest connection to a previous king of Wessex was as a great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a> (688–726), but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of <a href="Cerdic">Cerdic</a>, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty, which made him an <a href="%C3%A6theling">ætheling</a>, a prince who had a legitimate claim to the throne. But in the ninth and tenth centuries Ecgberht's line controlled the kingdom, and all æthelings were sons of kings.

At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>s. The Midland kingdom of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> dominated southern England, but their supremacy came to an end in 825 when they were decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ellendun">Battle of Ellendun</a>. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to <a href="Viking">Viking</a> attacks. In the same year Ecgberht sent his son <a href="%C3%86thelwulf">Æthelwulf</a> to conquer the Mercian sub-kingdom of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> (the area of the <a href="Kent">modern county</a> plus <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Surrey">Surrey</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sussex">Sussex</a>) and appointed him sub-king. In 835 the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> was ravaged by Vikings and in the following year they defeated Ecgberht at <a href="Carhampton%2C%20Somerset">Carhampton</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of <a href="Cornishmen">Cornishmen</a> and Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hingston%20Down">Battle of Hingston Down</a>, reducing Cornwall to the status of a <a href="client%20kingdom">client kingdom</a>. He died in 839 and was succeeded by Æthelwulf, who appointed his eldest son <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20of%20Kent">Æthelstan</a> as sub-king of Kent. Æthelwulf and Ecgberht may not have intended a permanent union between Wessex and Kent as they both appointed sons as sub-kings and charters in Wessex were attested (witnessed) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish charters were witnessed by the Kentish elite; both kings kept overall control and the sub-kings were not allowed to issue their own coinage.

Viking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton. In 850 Æthelstan defeated a Danish fleet off <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a> in the first recorded naval battle in English history. In 851 Æthelwulf and his second son <a href="%C3%86thelbald%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald</a> defeated the Vikings at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aclea">Battle of Aclea</a> and, according to the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen raiding-army that we have heard tell of up to this present day, and there took the victory".

Charters provide the major source for Æthelberht's life and narrative accounts are very limited. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" only mentions two events in his reign and these are also the only incidents related in <a href="Asser">Asser</a>'s biography of his younger brother <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, which is mainly based on the "Chronicle" for the mid-tenth century.

Æthelberht was the third of five sons of Æthelwulf and his first wife <a href="Osburh">Osburh</a>, who died around 855. Æthelstan died in the early 850s, but the four younger brothers were successively kings of Wessex: Æthelbald from 855 to 860, Æthelberht from 860 to 865, <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred I</a> from 865 to 871 and Alfred the Great from 871 to 899. Æthelberht had one sister, <a href="%C3%86thelswith">Æthelswith</a>, who married King <a href="Burgred%20of%20Mercia">Burgred of Mercia</a> in 853.

Æthelberht was first recorded when he attested charters in 854. In the following year Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome after appointing his eldest surviving son, Æthelbald, under-king of Wessex and Æthelberht under-king of Kent, Essex, Sussex and Surrey, appointments which suggest that his sons were to succeed to the separate kingdoms whether or not he returned to England. Æthelberht attested charters as "dux" (ealdorman) in 854 and king in 855. In 856, Æthelwulf returned to England with a new wife, <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders">Judith</a>, daughter of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, king of the <a href="West%20Franks">West Franks</a>. Æthelbald, with the support of <a href="Eahlstan">Eahlstan</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne">Bishop of Sherborne</a>, and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, refused to give up his kingship of Wessex. Æthelwulf compromised to avoid a civil war, but historians disagree how the kingdom was divided. According to Asser, Æthelwulf was assigned the "eastern districts", and most historians assume that Æthelbald kept Wessex while Æthelberht gave up the Kent to his father; some others believe that Wessex itself was divided, with Æthelbald ruling the west and Æthelwulf the east, and Æthelberht retaining Kent.

Æthelwulf confirmed that he intended a permanent division of his kingdom as he recommended that on his death Æthelbald should be king of Wessex and Æthelberht king of Kent. This proposal was carried out when Æthelwulf died in 858. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle": "And then Æthelwulf's two sons succeeded to the kingdom: Æthelbald to the kingdom of Wessex, and Æthelberht to the kingdom of the inhabitants of Kent and to the kingdom of Essex and to Surrey and to the kingdom of Sussex". Æthelbald was later condemned by Alfred the Great's biographer, Asser, both for his rebellion against his father and because he married his father's widow, but he appears to have been on good terms with Æthelberht. In 858 Æthelbald issued a charter (S 1274) relating to land in Surrey, and thus in his brother's territory, and a charter he issued in 860 (S 326) was witnessed by Æthelberht and Judith.

Æthelberht appears to have made significant changes in personnel as a Kentish charter of 858 (S 328) was witnessed by twenty-one <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s, out of whom fourteen did not witness a surviving charter of his father. They include Eastmund, who Æthelberht later appointed ealdorman of Kent. The charter is regarded by historians as important because it clarifies the obligations of <a href="Bookland%20%28law%29">folkland</a>. 

The separation of Wessex and Kent was soon reversed as Æthelbald died childless in 860 and Æthelberht succeeded to the whole kingdom of Wessex and Kent. Æthelred and Alfred may have been intended to succeed in Wessex, but they were too young as the preference was for adults as kings, especially when Wessex was under threat from the Vikings. During Æthelberht's rule over the whole kingdom, Wessex and its recent south-eastern conquests became a united kingdom for the first time. Unlike his father and grandfather, Æthelberht did not appoint another member of his family as under-king of Kent. A Kentish <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20charters">charter</a> issued in the first year of his reign (S 327) was the first to include a full complement both of West Saxon and Kentish attesters, although he then returned to locally attested charters. The historian <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> sees this charter as 

According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Æthelberht reigned "in good harmony and in great peace" and "in peace, love and honour". He appears to have been on good terms with his younger brothers and in a charter of 861 (S 330) he granted land to <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's, Canterbury</a> in return for the abbot's continuing loyalty to him, Æthelred and Alfred. Some historians believe that the three brothers agreed that each would succeed to the throne in turn. In two charters in 862 and 863 (S 335 and S 336) Æthelred makes grants as king of the West Saxons and Æthelberht is not mentioned. In Keynes's view, Æthelberht may have delegated some power in Wessex, perhaps in his own absence. However, a charter of Æthelberht dated December 863 (S 333) is attested by Æthelred and Alfred as "filius regis" (king's son). Æthelberht granted immunity from royal and judicial services to Sherborne church in honour of the souls of his father Æthelwulf and his brother Æthelbald. Unlike most charters, which were in Latin, this one is in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, and historians disagree whether this reflects a trend towards greater use of the vernacular as better suited to recording legal documents or support for Alfred's later claim that knowledge of Latin had declined disastrously when he came to the throne in 871.

Æthelberht's reign began and ended with raids by the Vikings. In 860 a Viking army sailed from the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme</a> to England and sacked Winchester, but they were then defeated by the men of Hampshire and Berkshire. Probably in the autumn of 864, another Viking army camped on <a href="Isle%20of%20Thanet">Thanet</a> and were promised money in return for peace, but they broke their promise and ravaged eastern Kent. These attacks were minor compared with events after Æthelberht's death, when the Vikings almost conquered England.

In the late eighth and ninth centuries the only denomination of coin produced in southern England was the silver penny. Coins were minted in an unidentified town in Wessex itself, but activity in the mid-ninth century was minimal and no Wessex coins of Æthelberht are known. Kent had mints at Canterbury and Rochester and they produced coins in the name of Æthelwulf until 858 and Æthelberht thereafter. The lack of coins in the name of Æthelbald is evidence that he did not have any status of overlordship over Æthelberht. In the early ninth century the quality of the inscription and the bust of the king on coins declined, but it revived on the Inscribed Cross penny at the end of Æthelwulf's reign and this continued under Æthelberht's, which also saw the introduction of the rare Floreate Cross design in about 862. There was a considerable increase in the number of moneyers: twelve struck Inscribed Cross coins in Æthelwulf's reign and fifty in Æthelberht's. This may have been due to a recoinage starting at the end of Æthelwulf's reign and continuing in Æthelberht's, when old coins were called in and melted down to make new ones. The silver content of his Inscribed Cross issue fell to below 50% and one penny minted in Canterbury has only 30%, but a Floreate Cross coin has 84%, perhaps indicating that it was an intended as a recoinage with higher fineness. There was also increasing standardisation of design in the coinage, reflecting greater royal control over currency and minting in the middle of the ninth century.
Æthelberht died of unknown causes in the autumn of 865. He was buried at <a href="Sherborne%20Abbey">Sherborne Abbey</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> beside his brother Æthelbald but the tombs had been lost by the sixteenth century. He had no known children and was succeeded by his brother <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a>.

According to Asser, who based his account of events before 887 mainly on the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle": "So after governing in peace, love and honour for five years, Æthelberht went the way of all flesh, to the great sorrow of his people; and he lies buried honourably beside his brother, at Sherborne." Asser's view was followed by post-<a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Conquest</a> historians. <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> copied Asser's words, while <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> described him as "a vigorous but kindly ruler". The 20th-century historian <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Smyth">Alfred Smyth</a> points out that the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which was first written in Alfred the Great's reign, only recorded two events in Æthelberht's reign, the attacks on Winchester and eastern Kent, and does not associate the king personally with either of them. Smyth argues that this reflected an agenda by Alfred's propagandists to downplay the achievements of his brothers to enhance the reputation of Alfred himself.

As such, he was involved in the expulsion of the <a href="Bonus%20Army">Bonus Army</a> protesters from Washington, D.C. in 1932, and the establishment and organization of the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>. He retired from the US Army in 1937 to become <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Military%20Advisor%20to%20the%20Commonwealth%20Government%20of%20the%20Philippines">Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines</a>.

MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Forces%20in%20the%20Far%20East">United States Army Forces in the Far East</a>. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air forces on 8 December 1941 and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to <a href="Bataan">Bataan</a>, where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left nearby <a href="Corregidor%20Island">Corregidor Island</a> in <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s and <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur%27s%20escape%20from%20the%20Philippines">escaped to Australia</a>, where MacArthur became <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Commander</a>, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a>. Upon his arrival, MacArthur gave a speech in which he famously promised "I shall return" to the Philippines. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled that promise. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. He officially accepted the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Surrender of Japan</a> on 2 September 1945 aboard the , which was anchored in Tokyo Bay, and he oversaw the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> from 1945 to 1951. As the effective ruler of Japan, he oversaw sweeping economic, political and social changes. He led the <a href="United%20Nations%20Command">United Nations Command</a> in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> with initial success; however, the controversial invasion of North Korea provoked Chinese intervention. Following a series of major defeats, he was <a href="President%20Truman%27s%20relief%20of%20General%20Douglas%20MacArthur">removed from command</a> by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> on 11 April 1951. He later became chairman of the board of <a href="Remington%20Rand">Remington Rand</a>.

A <a href="Military%20brat%20%28U.S.%20subculture%29">military brat</a>, Douglas MacArthur was born 26 January 1880, at <a href="Tower%20Building%20of%20the%20Little%20Rock%20Arsenal">Little Rock Barracks</a>, <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, to <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%2C%20Jr.">Arthur MacArthur, Jr.</a>, a U.S. Army <a href="captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a>, and his wife, Mary Pinkney Hardy MacArthur (nicknamed "Pinky"). Arthur, Jr. was the son of Scottish-born jurist and politician <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%2C%20Sr.">Arthur MacArthur, Sr.</a>, Arthur would later receive the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his actions with the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">Battle of Missionary Ridge</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, and be promoted to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a>. Pinkney came from a prominent <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, family. Two of her brothers had fought for the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">South</a> in the Civil War, and refused to attend her wedding. Arthur and Pinky had three sons, of whom Douglas was the youngest, following <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%20III">Arthur III</a>, born on 1 August 1876, and Malcolm, born on 17 October 1878. The family lived on a succession of Army posts in the <a href="American%20Old%20West">American Old West</a>. Conditions were primitive, and Malcolm died of measles in 1883. In his memoir, "Reminiscences", MacArthur wrote "I learned to ride and shoot even before I could read or write—indeed, almost before I could walk and talk."
MacArthur's time on the frontier ended in July 1889 when the family moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended the Force Public School. His father was posted to San Antonio, Texas, in September 1893. While there MacArthur attended the <a href="TMI%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Episcopal%20School%20of%20Texas">West Texas Military Academy</a>, where he was awarded the gold medal for "scholarship and deportment". He also participated on the school tennis team, and played quarterback on the school football team and shortstop on its baseball team. He was named valedictorian, with a final year average of 97.33 out of 100. MacArthur's father and grandfather unsuccessfully sought to secure Douglas a presidential appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, first from President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> and then from President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. After these two rejections, he was given coaching and private tutoring by Milwaukee high school teacher <a href="Gertrude%20Hull">Gertrude Hull</a>. He then passed the examination for an appointment from Congressman <a href="Theobald%20Otjen">Theobald Otjen</a>, scoring 93.3 on the test. He later wrote: "It was a lesson I never forgot. Preparedness is the key to success and victory."

MacArthur entered West Point on 13 June 1899, and his mother also moved there, to a suite at Craney's Hotel, which overlooked the grounds of the Academy. <a href="Hazing">Hazing</a> was widespread at West Point at this time, and MacArthur and his classmate <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20III">Ulysses S. Grant III</a> were singled out for special attention by southern cadets as sons of generals with mothers living at Craney's. When Cadet Oscar Booz left West Point after being hazed and subsequently died of tuberculosis, there was a congressional inquiry. MacArthur was called to appear before a special Congressional committee in 1901, where he testified against cadets implicated in hazing, but downplayed his own hazing even though the other cadets gave the full story to the committee. Congress subsequently outlawed acts "of a harassing, tyrannical, abusive, shameful, insulting or humiliating nature", although hazing continued. MacArthur was a corporal in Company B in his second year, a <a href="first%20sergeant">first sergeant</a> in Company A in his third year and <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy%23Rank%20and%20organization">First Captain</a> in his final year. He played left field for the baseball team and academically earned 2424.12 merits out of a possible 2470.00 or 98.14, which was the third highest score ever recorded. He graduated first in his 93-man class on 11 June 1903. At the time it was customary for the top-ranking cadets to be commissioned into the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a>, so MacArthur was commissioned as a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%20%28United%20States%29">second lieutenant</a> in that corps.

MacArthur spent his graduation furlough with his parents at <a href="Fort%20Mason">Fort Mason</a>, California, where his father, now a major general, was serving as commander of the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Pacific">Department of the Pacific</a>. Afterward, he joined the 3rd Engineer Battalion, which departed for the Philippines in October 1903. MacArthur was sent to <a href="Iloilo">Iloilo</a>, where he supervised the construction of a wharf at <a href="Camp%20Jossman">Camp Jossman</a>. He went on to conduct surveys at <a href="Tacloban%20City">Tacloban City</a>, <a href="Calbayog%20City">Calbayog City</a> and <a href="Cebu%20City">Cebu City</a>. In November 1903, while working on <a href="Guimaras">Guimaras</a>, he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino <a href="Brigandage">brigands</a> or guerrillas; he shot and killed both with his pistol. He was promoted to first lieutenant in <a href="Manila">Manila</a> in April 1904. In October 1904, his tour of duty was cut short when he contracted <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="Tinea%20cruris">dhobi itch</a> during a survey on <a href="Bataan">Bataan</a>. He returned to San Francisco, where he was assigned to the <a href="California%20Debris%20Commission">California Debris Commission</a>. In July 1905, he became chief engineer of the Division of the Pacific.

In October 1905, MacArthur received orders to proceed to Tokyo for appointment as aide-de-camp to his father. A man who knew the MacArthurs at this time wrote that: "Arthur MacArthur was the most flamboyantly egotistical man I had ever seen, until I met his son." They inspected Japanese military bases at <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> and <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, then headed to India via <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, Hong Kong, <a href="Java">Java</a> and Singapore, reaching <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> in January 1906. In India, they visited Madras, Tuticorin, Quetta, Karachi, the Northwest Frontier and the <a href="Khyber%20Pass">Khyber Pass</a>. They then sailed to China via Bangkok and Saigon, and toured Canton, Tsingtao, Peking, Tientsin, Hankow and Shanghai before returning to Japan in June. The next month they returned to the United States, where Arthur MacArthur resumed his duties at Fort Mason, still with Douglas as his aide. In September, Douglas received orders to report to the <a href="2nd%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Engineer Battalion</a> at the <a href="Fort%20Lesley%20J.%20McNair">Washington Barracks</a> and enroll in the Engineer School. While there he also served as "an aide to assist at White House functions" at the request of President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.

In August 1907, MacArthur was sent to the engineer district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a>, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, Texas, with the <a href="Divisions%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army%23Divisions%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army%20%281911%20to%201917%29">Maneuver Division</a> in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>. Army Chief of Staff, Major General <a href="Leonard%20Wood">Leonard Wood</a>, took up the matter with <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.

On 21 April 1914, President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> ordered the <a href="U.S.%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">occupation of Veracruz</a>. MacArthur joined the headquarters staff that was sent to the area, arriving on 1 May 1914. He realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of railroad cars in Veracruz but no locomotives, MacArthur set out to verify a report that there were a number of locomotives in <a href="Alvarado%2C%20Veracruz">Alvarado, Veracruz</a>. For $150 in gold, he acquired a <a href="handcar">handcar</a> and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only <a href="switcher">switcher</a>s, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, his party was set upon by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed. One of his companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party was attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but his men, using their handcar, managed to outrun all but one of their attackers. MacArthur shot both that man and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.

A fellow officer wrote to Wood recommending that MacArthur's name be put forward for the Medal of Honor. Wood did so, and Chief of Staff <a href="Hugh%20L.%20Scott">Hugh L. Scott</a> convened a board to consider the award. The board questioned "the advisability of this enterprise having been undertaken without the knowledge of the commanding general on the ground". This was Brigadier General <a href="Frederick%20Funston">Frederick Funston</a>, a Medal of Honor recipient himself, who considered awarding the medal to MacArthur "entirely appropriate and justifiable". However the board feared that "to bestow the award recommended might encourage any other staff officer, under similar conditions, to ignore the local commander, possibly interfering with the latter's plans"; consequently, MacArthur received no award at all.

MacArthur returned to the War Department, where he was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> on 11 December 1915. In June 1916, he was assigned as head of the Bureau of Information at the office of the Secretary of War, <a href="Newton%20D.%20Baker">Newton D. Baker</a>. MacArthur has since been regarded as the Army's first press officer. Following the declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Baker and MacArthur secured an agreement from President Wilson for the use of the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> on the Western Front. MacArthur suggested sending first a division organized from units of different states, so as to avoid the appearance of favoritism toward any particular state. Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the <a href="42nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">42nd ("Rainbow") Division</a>, and appointed Major General <a href="William%20A.%20Mann">William A. Mann</a>, the head of the <a href="National%20Guard%20Bureau">National Guard Bureau</a>, as its commander; MacArthur was its chief of staff, with the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>. At MacArthur's request, this commission was in the infantry rather than the engineers.

The 42nd Division was assembled in August and September 1917 at <a href="Camp%20Mills">Camp Mills</a>, New York, where its training emphasized open-field combat rather than <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>. It sailed in a convoy from <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, for France on 18 October 1917. On 19 December, Mann was replaced as division commander by Major General <a href="Charles%20T.%20Menoher">Charles T. Menoher</a>.

The 42nd Division entered the line in the quiet <a href="Lun%C3%A9ville">Lunéville</a> sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain <a href="Thomas%20T.%20Handy">Thomas T. Handy</a> accompanied a French <a href="Trench%20raiding">trench raid</a> in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the <a href="7e%20corps%20d%27arm%C3%A9e%20%28France%29">French VII Corps</a>, Major General <a href="Georges%20de%20Bazelaire">Georges de Bazelaire</a>, decorated MacArthur with the "<a href="Croix%20de%20Guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>". Menoher recommended MacArthur for a Silver Star, which he later received. The <a href="Silver%20Star%20Medal">Silver Star Medal</a> was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small <a href="Silver%20Citation%20Star">Silver Citation Star</a>s were authorized to be worn on the campaign ribbons of those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mention in despatches</a>. When the Silver Star Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the <a href="168th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">168th Infantry</a>. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their <a href="gas%20mask">gas mask</a>s but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in time to show Secretary Baker around the area on 19 March.

MacArthur was promoted to brigadier general on 26 June. In late June, the 42nd Division was shifted to <a href="Ch%C3%A2lons-en-Champagne">Châlons-en-Champagne</a> to oppose the impending German <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne">Champagne-Marne Offensive</a>. "<a href="G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral%20d%27Arm%C3%A9e">Général d'Armée</a>" <a href="Henri%20Gouraud%20%28French%20Army%20officer%29">Henri Gouraud</a> of the <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28France%29">French Fourth Army</a> elected to meet the attack with a <a href="defense%20in%20depth">defense in depth</a>, holding the front line area as thinly as possible and meeting the German attack on his second line of defense. His plan succeeded, and MacArthur was awarded a second Silver Star. The 42nd Division participated in the subsequent Allied counter-offensive, and MacArthur was awarded a third Silver Star on 29 July. Two days later, Menoher relieved Brigadier General Robert A. Brown of the 84th Infantry Brigade of his command, and replaced him with MacArthur. Hearing reports that the enemy had withdrawn, MacArthur went forward on 2 August to see for himself. He later wrote: 

MacArthur reported back to Menoher and Lieutenant General <a href="Hunter%20Liggett">Hunter Liggett</a> that the Germans had indeed withdrawn, and was awarded a fourth Silver Star. He was also awarded a second "Croix de guerre" and made a "commandeur" of the "<a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>".

The 42nd Division earned a few weeks rest, returning to the line for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saint-Mihiel">Battle of Saint-Mihiel</a> on 12 September 1918. The Allied advance proceeded rapidly and MacArthur was awarded a fifth Silver Star for his leadership of the 84th Infantry Brigade. He received a sixth Silver Star for his participation in a raid on the night of 25–26 September. The 42nd Division was relieved on the night of 30 September and moved to the <a href="Forest%20of%20Argonne">Argonne</a> sector where it relieved the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Division</a> on the night of 11 October. On a reconnaissance the next day, MacArthur was gassed again, earning a second <a href="Wound%20Chevron">Wound Chevron</a>.
The 42nd Division's participation in the <a href="Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a> began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which <a href="Charles%20Pelot%20Summerall">Charles Pelot Summerall</a>, commander of the First Infantry Division and <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">V Corps</a>, telephoned and demanded that <a href="Ch%C3%A2tillon-sous-les-C%C3%B4tes">Châtillon</a> be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed a gap in the German barbed wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the <a href="167th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">167th Infantry</a>—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the barbed wire.

Summerall nominated MacArthur for the Medal of Honor and promotion to major general, but he received neither. Instead he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Cross. The 42nd Division returned to the line for the last time on the night of 4–5 November 1918. In the final advance on <a href="Sedan%2C%20Ardennes">Sedan</a>. MacArthur later wrote that this operation "narrowly missed being one of the great tragedies of American history". An order to disregard unit boundaries led to units crossing into each other's zones. In the resulting chaos, MacArthur was taken prisoner by men of the 1st Division, who mistook him for a German general. His performance in the attack on the <a href="Meuse%20%28river%29">Meuse</a> heights led to his being awarded a seventh Silver Star. On 10 November, a day before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">armistice</a> that ended the fighting, MacArthur was appointed commander of the 42nd Division. For his service as chief of staff and commander of the 84th Infantry Brigade, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28US%20Army%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a>.

His period in command was brief, for on 22 November he, like other brigadier generals, was replaced, and returned to the 84th Infantry Brigade. The 42nd Division was chosen to participate in the occupation of the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, occupying the <a href="Ahrweiler%20%28district%29">Ahrweiler district</a>. In April 1919, they entrained for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> and <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>, where they boarded ships to return to the United States. MacArthur traveled on the ocean liner , which reached New York on 25 April 1919.

In 1919, MacArthur became <a href="Superintendents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Military%20Academy">Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy</a> at West Point, which Chief of Staff <a href="Peyton%20March">Peyton March</a> felt had become out of date in many respects and was much in need of reform. Accepting the post allowed MacArthur to retain his rank of brigadier general, instead of being reduced to his <a href="Substantive%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive</a> rank of major like many of his contemporaries. When MacArthur moved into the superintendent's house with his mother in June 1919, he became the youngest superintendent since <a href="Sylvanus%20Thayer">Sylvanus Thayer</a> in 1817. However, whereas Thayer had faced opposition from outside the Army, MacArthur had to overcome resistance from graduates and the academic board.
MacArthur's vision of what was required of an officer came not just from his recent experience of combat in France but also from that of the occupation of the Rhineland in Germany. The military government of the Rhineland had required the Army to deal with political, economic and social problems but he had found that many West Point graduates had little or no knowledge of fields outside of the military sciences. During the war, West Point had been reduced to an <a href="officer%20candidate%20school">officer candidate school</a>, with five classes graduated in two years. Cadet and staff morale was low and hazing "at an all-time peak of viciousness". MacArthur's first change turned out to be the easiest. Congress had set the length of the course at three years. MacArthur was able to get the four-year course restored.

During the debate over the length of the course, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" brought up the issue of the cloistered and undemocratic nature of student life at West Point. Also, starting with Harvard University in 1869, civilian universities had begun grading students on academic performance alone, but West Point had retained the old "whole man" concept of education. MacArthur sought to modernize the system, expanding the concept of military character to include bearing, leadership, efficiency and athletic performance. He formalized the hitherto unwritten <a href="Cadet%20Honor%20Code">Cadet Honor Code</a> in 1922 when he formed the Cadet Honor Committee to review alleged code violations. Elected by the cadets themselves, it had no authority to punish, but acted as a kind of grand jury, reporting offenses to the commandant. MacArthur attempted to end hazing by using officers rather than upperclassmen to train the <a href="plebe">plebe</a>s.

Instead of the traditional summer camp at <a href="Fort%20Clinton">Fort Clinton</a>, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at <a href="Fort%20Dix">Fort Dix</a>; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, the study of the campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In History class, more emphasis was placed on the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, "The Brag", forerunner of today's "West Pointer". He also permitted cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern dollars) a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.

MacArthur became romantically involved with socialite and multi-millionaire heiress <a href="Louise%20Cromwell%20Brooks">Louise Cromwell Brooks</a>. They were married at her family's villa in Palm Beach, Florida on 14 February 1922. Rumors circulated that General Pershing, who had also courted Louise, had threatened to exile them to the Philippines if they were married. Pershing denied this as "all damn poppycock". In October 1922, MacArthur left West Point and sailed to the Philippines with Louise and her two children, Walter and Louise, to assume command of the Military District of Manila. MacArthur was fond of the children, and spent much of his free time with them.

The <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">revolts in the Philippines</a> had been suppressed, the islands were peaceful now, and in the wake of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, the garrison was being reduced. MacArthur's friendships with Filipinos like <a href="Manuel%20Quezon">Manuel Quezon</a> offended some people. "The old idea of colonial exploitation", he later conceded, "still had its vigorous supporters." In February and March 1923 MacArthur returned to Washington to see his mother, who was ill from a heart ailment. She recovered, but it was the last time he saw his brother Arthur, who died suddenly from <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> in December 1923. In June 1923, MacArthur assumed command of the 23rd Infantry Brigade of the <a href="Philippine%20Division">Philippine Division</a>. On 7 July 1924, he was informed that a mutiny had broken out amongst the <a href="Philippine%20Scouts">Philippine Scouts</a> over grievances concerning pay and allowances. Over 200 were arrested and there were fears of an insurrection. MacArthur was able to calm the situation, but his subsequent efforts to improve the salaries of Filipino troops were frustrated by financial stringency and racial prejudice. On 17 January 1925, at the age of 44, he was promoted, becoming the Army's youngest major general.

Returning to the U.S., MacArthur took command of the <a href="Corps%20area">IV Corps Area</a>, based at <a href="Fort%20McPherson">Fort McPherson</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, on 2 May 1925. However, he encountered southern prejudice because he was the son of a Union Army officer, and requested to be relieved. A few months later, he assumed command of the III Corps area, based at <a href="Fort%20McHenry">Fort McHenry</a> in Baltimore, Maryland, which allowed MacArthur and Louise to move to her Rainbow Hill estate near <a href="Garrison%2C%20Maryland">Garrison, Maryland</a>. However, this relocation also led to what he later described as "one of the most distasteful orders I ever received": a direction to serve on the court-martial of Brigadier General <a href="Billy%20Mitchell">Billy Mitchell</a>. MacArthur was the youngest of the thirteen judges, none of whom had aviation experience. Three of them, including Summerall, the president of the court, were removed when defense challenges revealed bias against Mitchell. Despite MacArthur's claim that he had voted to acquit, Mitchell was found guilty as charged and convicted. MacArthur felt "that a senior officer should not be silenced for being at variance with his superiors in rank and with accepted doctrine".

In 1927, MacArthur and Louise separated, and she moved to New York City. In August that year, <a href="William%20C.%20Prout">William C. Prout</a>—the president of the <a href="United%20States%20Olympic%20Committee">American Olympic Committee</a>—died suddenly and the committee elected MacArthur as their new president. His main task was to prepare the U.S. team for the <a href="1928%20Summer%20Olympics">1928 Summer Olympics</a> in Amsterdam. MacArthur saw the team as representatives of the United States, and its task was to win medals. "We have not come 3,000 miles", he told them, "just to lose gracefully." The Americans had a successful meet, winning the most medals and setting various records. Upon returning to the U.S., MacArthur received orders to assume command of the <a href="Philippine%20Department">Philippine Department</a>. In 1929, while he was in Manila, Louise obtained a divorce, ostensibly on the grounds of "failure to provide". In view of Louise's great wealth, <a href="William%20Manchester">William Manchester</a> described this legal fiction as "preposterous".

By 1930, MacArthur was 50 and still the youngest and best known of the U.S. Army's major generals. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to have lunch with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial <a href="kimono">kimono</a>, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled <a href="cigarette%20holder">cigarette holder</a>. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.

The onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> forced Congress to make cuts in the Army's personnel and budget. Some 53 bases were closed, but MacArthur managed to prevent attempts to reduce the number of regular officers from 12,000 to 10,000. MacArthur's main programs included the development of new mobilization plans. He grouped the nine corps areas together under four armies, which were charged with responsibility for training and frontier defense. He also negotiated the MacArthur-Pratt agreement with the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20V.%20Pratt">William V. Pratt</a>. This was the first of a series of inter-service agreements over the following decades that defined the responsibilities of the different services with respect to aviation. This agreement placed coastal air defense under the Army. In March 1935, MacArthur activated a centralized air command, <a href="General%20Headquarters%20Air%20Force">General Headquarters Air Force</a>, under Major General <a href="Frank%20M.%20Andrews">Frank M. Andrews</a>.
One of MacArthur's most controversial acts came in 1932, when the "<a href="Bonus%20Army">Bonus Army</a>" of veterans converged on Washington. He sent tents and camp equipment to the demonstrators, along with mobile kitchens, until an outburst in Congress caused the kitchens to be withdrawn. MacArthur was concerned that the demonstration had been taken over by communists and pacifists but the General Staff's intelligence division reported that only three of the march's 26 key leaders were communists. MacArthur went over contingency plans for civil disorder in the capital. Mechanized equipment was brought to Fort Myer, where anti-riot training was conducted.

On 28 July 1932, in a clash with the District police, two veterans were shot, and later died. President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> ordered MacArthur to "surround the affected area and clear it without delay". MacArthur brought up troops and tanks and, against the advice of Major <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, decided to accompany the troops, although he was not in charge of the operation. The troops advanced with bayonets and sabers drawn under a shower of bricks and rocks, but no shots were fired. In less than four hours, they cleared the Bonus Army's campground using tear gas. The gas canisters started a number of fires, causing the only death during the riots. While not as violent as other anti-riot operations, it was nevertheless a public relations disaster. However, the defeat of the "Bonus Army" while unpopular with the American people at large, did make MacArthur into the hero of the more right-wing elements in the Republican Party who believed that the general had saved America from a communist revolution in 1932.
In 1934, MacArthur sued journalists <a href="Drew%20Pearson%20%28journalist%29">Drew Pearson</a> and <a href="Robert%20S.%20Allen">Robert S. Allen</a> for defamation after they described his treatment of the Bonus marchers as "unwarranted, unnecessary, insubordinate, harsh and brutal". In turn, they threatened to call <a href="Isabel%20Rosario%20Cooper">Isabel Rosario Cooper</a> as a witness. MacArthur had met Isabel, a <a href="Eurasian%20%28mixed%20ancestry%29">Eurasian</a> woman, while in the Philippines, and she had become his mistress. MacArthur was forced to settle out of court, secretly paying Pearson $15,000.

In the <a href="1932%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">1932 presidential election</a>, Herbert Hoover was defeated by <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. MacArthur and Roosevelt had worked together before World War I and had remained friends despite their political differences. MacArthur supported the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> through the Army's operation of the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>. He ensured that detailed plans were drawn up for its employment and decentralized its administration to the corps areas, which became an important factor in the program's success. MacArthur's support for a strong military, and his public criticism of pacifism and isolationism, made him unpopular with the Roosevelt administration.

Perhaps the most incendiary exchange between Roosevelt and MacArthur occurred over an administration proposal to cut 51% of the Army's budget. In response, MacArthur lectured Roosevelt that "when we lost the next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spat out his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur, but Roosevelt". In response, Roosevelt yelled, "you must not talk that way to the President!" MacArthur offered to resign, but Roosevelt refused his request, and MacArthur then staggered out of the White House and vomited on the front steps.

In spite of such exchanges, MacArthur was extended an extra year as chief of staff, and ended his tour in October 1935. For his service as chief of staff, he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. He was retroactively awarded two Purple Hearts for his World War I service, a decoration that he authorized in 1932 based loosely on the defunct Military Badge of Merit. MacArthur also insisted on being the first recipient of the Purple Heart, which he had engraved with "#1".

When the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20the%20Philippines">Commonwealth of the Philippines</a> achieved semi-independent status in 1935, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Philippines">President of the Philippines</a> Manuel Quezon asked MacArthur to supervise the creation of a Philippine Army. Quezon and MacArthur had been personal friends since the latter's father had been <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a>, 35 years earlier. With President Roosevelt's approval, MacArthur accepted the assignment. It was agreed that MacArthur would receive the rank of <a href="field%20marshal">field marshal</a>, with its salary and allowances, in addition to his major general's salary as <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Military%20Advisor%20to%20the%20Commonwealth%20Government%20of%20the%20Philippines">Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines</a>. It would be his fifth tour in the Far East. MacArthur sailed from San Francisco on the in October 1935, accompanied by his mother and sister-in-law. He brought Eisenhower and Major <a href="James%20B.%20Ord">James B. Ord</a> along as his assistants. Another passenger on the "President Hoover" was <a href="Jean%20MacArthur">Jean Marie Faircloth</a>, an unmarried 37-year-old socialite. Over the next two years, MacArthur and Faircloth were frequently seen together. His mother became gravely ill during the voyage and died in Manila on 3 December 1935.
President Quezon officially conferred the title of field marshal on MacArthur in a ceremony at <a href="Malaca%C3%B1an%20Palace">Malacañan Palace</a> on 24 August 1936, and presented him with a gold <a href="Baton%20%28military%29">baton</a> and a unique uniform. The Philippine Army was formed from conscription. Training was conducted by a regular cadre, and the <a href="Philippine%20Military%20Academy">Philippine Military Academy</a> was created along the lines of West Point to train officers. MacArthur and Eisenhower found that few of the training camps had been constructed and the first group of 20,000 trainees did not report until early 1937. Equipment and weapons were "more or less obsolete" American cast offs, and the budget was completely inadequate. MacArthur's requests for equipment fell on deaf ears, although MacArthur and his naval advisor, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Sidney%20L.%20Huff">Sidney L. Huff</a>, persuaded the Navy to initiate the development of the <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>. Much hope was placed in the <a href="Philippine%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Philippine Army Air Corps</a>, but the first squadron was not organized until 1939.

MacArthur married Jean Faircloth in a civil ceremony on 30 April 1937. Their marriage produced a son, <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%20IV">Arthur MacArthur IV</a>, who was born in Manila on 21 February 1938. On 31 December 1937, MacArthur officially retired from the Army. He ceased to represent the U.S. as military adviser to the government, but remained as Quezon's adviser in a civilian capacity. Eisenhower returned to the U.S., and was replaced as MacArthur's chief of staff by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard%20K.%20Sutherland">Richard K. Sutherland</a>, while <a href="Richard%20J.%20Marshall">Richard J. Marshall</a> became deputy chief of staff.

On 26 July 1941, Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a major general, and named him commander of <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Forces%20in%20the%20Far%20East">U.S. Army Forces in the Far East</a> (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day, and then to general on 20 December. On 31 July 1941, the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, under the command of Major General <a href="Jonathan%20M.%20Wainwright%20%28general%29">Jonathan M. Wainwright</a>. The initial American plan for the defense of the Philippines called for the main body of the troops to retreat to the Bataan peninsula in Manila Bay to hold out against the Japanese until a relief force could arrive. MacArthur changed this plan to one of attempting to hold all of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> and using B-17 Flying Fortresses to sink Japanese ships that approached the islands. MacArthur persuaded the decision-makers in Washington that his plans represented the best deterrent to prevent Japan from choosing war and of winning a war if worse did come to worse.

Between July and December 1941, the garrison received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, a backlog of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels. In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as <a href="Station%20CAST">Station CAST</a>, had an ultra secret <a href="Purple%20%28cipher%20machine%29">Purple cipher machine</a>, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest <a href="JN-25">JN-25 naval code</a>. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.

At 03:30 local time on 8 December 1941 (about 09:00 on 7 December in Hawaii), Sutherland learned of the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and informed MacArthur. At 05:30, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>, ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, <a href="Rainbow%20Five">Rainbow Five</a>. MacArthur did nothing. On three occasions, the commander of the <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28United%20States%29">Far East Air Force</a>, Major General <a href="Lewis%20H.%20Brereton">Lewis H. Brereton</a>, requested permission to attack Japanese bases in <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>, in accordance with prewar intentions, but was denied by Sutherland. Not until 11:00 did Brereton speak with MacArthur about it, and obtained permission. MacArthur later denied having the conversation. At 12:30, nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, aircraft of Japan's <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Air%20Service">11th Air Fleet</a> achieved complete tactical surprise when they <a href="attack%20on%20Clark%20Field">attacked Clark Field</a> and the nearby fighter base at <a href="Iba%20Airfield">Iba Field</a>, and destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17s</a>, 53 of its 107 <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40s</a>, three <a href="Seversky%20P-35">P-35s</a>, and more than 25 other aircraft. Most were destroyed on the ground. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.
MacArthur attempted to slow the Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence in the ability of his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at <a href="Lingayen%20Gulf">Lingayen Gulf</a> on 21 December, and ordered a <a href="Battle%20of%20Bataan">retreat to Bataan</a>. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an <a href="open%20city">open city</a> at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Hart">Thomas C. Hart</a>, commanding the <a href="United%20States%20Asiatic%20Fleet">Asiatic Fleet</a>, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable materiel.

On the evening of 24 December, MacArthur moved his headquarters to the island fortress of <a href="Corregidor">Corregidor</a> in <a href="Manila%20Bay">Manila Bay</a> arriving at 21:30, with his headquarters reporting to Washington as being open on the 25th. A series of air raids by the Japanese destroyed all the exposed structures on the island and USAFFE headquarters was moved into the <a href="Malinta%20Tunnel">Malinta Tunnel</a>. Later, most of the headquarters moved to Bataan, leaving only the nucleus with MacArthur. The troops on Bataan knew that they had been written off but continued to fight. Some blamed Roosevelt and MacArthur for their predicament. A ballad sung to the tune of "<a href="The%20Battle%20Hymn%20of%20the%20Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>" called him "Dugout Doug". However, most clung to the belief that somehow MacArthur "would reach down and pull something out of his hat".

On 1 January 1942, MacArthur accepted $500,000 from President Quezon of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff. Eisenhower—after being appointed <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force</a> (AEF)—was also offered money by Quezon, but declined. These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. While the payments had been fully legal, the revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.

In February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to relocate to Australia. On the night of 12 March 1942, MacArthur and a select group that included his wife Jean, son Arthur, and Arthur's <a href="Cantonese%20people">Cantonese</a> "<a href="Amah%20%28occupation%29">amah</a>", Ah Cheu, fled Corregidor. MacArthur and his party reached <a href="Del%20Monte%20Airfield">Del Monte Airfield</a> on <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a>, where B-17s picked them up, and flew them to Australia. His famous speech, in which he said, "I came through and I shall return", was first made on <a href="Terowie%20railway%20station">Terowie railway station</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, on 20 March. Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to "We shall return". He ignored the request.

Bataan surrendered on 9 April, and Corregidor on 6 May. George Marshall decided that MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated, "to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command". Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen <a href="J.%20Parnell%20Thomas">J. Parnell Thomas</a> and <a href="James%20E.%20Van%20Zandt">James E. Van Zandt</a>, Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department, expressing that the recognition "would mean more" if the gallantry criteria were not waived by a bill of relief.

Marshall ordered Sutherland to recommend the award, and authored the citation himself. Ironically, this also meant that it violated the governing statute, as it could only be considered lawful so long as material requirements were waived by Congress, such as the unmet requirement to perform conspicuous gallantry "above and beyond the call of duty." Marshall admitted the defect to the Secretary of War, acknowledging that "there is no specific act of General MacArthur's to justify the award of the Medal of Honor under a literal interpretation of the statutes." Similarly, when the Army's Adjutant General reviewed the case in 1945, he determined that "authority for [MacArthur's] award is questionable under strict interpretation of regulations."

MacArthur had been nominated for the award twice before and understood that it was for leadership and not gallantry. He expressed the sentiment that "this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command". Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001, when Theodore Roosevelt was posthumously awarded for his service during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%2C%20Jr.">Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.</a> having received one posthumously for his service during World War II. MacArthur's citation, written by Marshall, read:
As the symbol of the forces resisting the Japanese, MacArthur received many other accolades. The Native American tribes of the Southwest chose him as a "Chief of Chiefs", which he acknowledged as from "my oldest friends, the companions of my boyhood days on the Western frontier". He was touched when he was named Father of the Year for 1942, and wrote to the National Father's Day Committee that:

On 18 April 1942, MacArthur was appointed <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Commander</a> of Allied Forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">Southwest Pacific Area</a> (SWPA). Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Brett%20%28general%29">George Brett</a> became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and Vice Admiral <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Leary">Herbert F. Leary</a> became Commander, Allied Naval Forces. Since the bulk of land forces in the theater were Australian, George Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries.

MacArthur established a close relationship with the Prime Minister of Australia, <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>, and was probably the second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them. MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General <a href="George%20C.%20Kenney">George C. Kenney</a> to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.
The staff of MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the "Bataan Gang". Though Roosevelt and George Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them. Initially located in Melbourne, GHQ moved to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>—the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities—in July 1942, occupying the Australian Mutual Provident Society building (renamed after the war as <a href="MacArthur%20Chambers">MacArthur Chambers</a>).

MacArthur formed his own <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> organization, known as the <a href="Central%20Bureau">Central Bureau</a>, from Australian intelligence units and American <a href="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysts</a> who had escaped from the Philippines. This unit forwarded <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> information to Willoughby for analysis. After a press release revealed details of the Japanese naval dispositions during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a>, at which a Japanese attempt to capture <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> was turned back, Roosevelt ordered that censorship be imposed in Australia, and the <a href="Advisory%20War%20Council%20%28Australia%29">Advisory War Council</a> granted GHQ censorship authority over the Australian press. Australian newspapers were restricted to what was reported in the daily GHQ communiqué. Veteran correspondents considered the communiqués, which MacArthur drafted personally, "a total farce" and "Alice-in-Wonderland information handed out at high level".

Anticipating that the Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> and <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> to cover its flanks. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for an attack on the Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious operation</a>. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu%E2%80%93Tanambogo">seizure of the Tulagi area</a>, would be conducted by the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">Pacific Ocean Areas</a>, under Admiral <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.
The Japanese struck first, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Buna-Gona">landing at Buna</a> in July, and at <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in August. The Australians repulsed the Japanese at Milne Bay, but a series of defeats in the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a> had a depressing effect back in Australia. On 30 August, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a> would be overwhelmed. He sent Blamey to Port Moresby to take personal command. Having committed all available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American forces. The <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">32nd Infantry Division</a>, a poorly trained National Guard division, was selected. A series of embarrassing reverses in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by the Australians. MacArthur then ordered Lieutenant General <a href="Robert%20L.%20Eichelberger">Robert L. Eichelberger</a> to assume command of the Americans, and "take Buna, or not come back alive".

MacArthur moved the advanced echelon of GHQ to Port Moresby on 6 November 1942. After Buna finally fell on 3 January 1943, MacArthur awarded the Distinguished Service Cross to twelve officers for "precise execution of operations". This use of the country's second highest award aroused resentment, because while some, like Eichelberger and <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a>, had fought in the field, others, like Sutherland and Willoughby, had not. For his part, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal, and the Australian government had him appointed an honorary <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Grand Cross of the British Order of the Bath</a>.

At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> approved MacArthur's plan for <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a>, the advance on Rabaul. MacArthur explained his strategy:

In <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, a country without roads, large-scale transportation of men and materiel would have to be accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the <a href="Amphibious%20warfare%20ship">landing ships</a> of the <a href="VII%20Amphibious%20Force">VII Amphibious Force</a>, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed <a href="Seventh%20Fleet">Seventh Fleet</a>. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>.

Lieutenant General <a href="Walter%20Krueger">Walter Krueger</a>'s <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Sixth Army</a> headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur had only three American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Battle of Buna–Gona and <a href="Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Battle of Guadalcanal</a>. As a result, "it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army". The offensive began with the <a href="landing%20at%20Lae">landing at Lae</a> by the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 9th Division</a> on 4 September 1943. The next day, MacArthur watched the <a href="landing%20at%20Nadzab">landing at Nadzab</a> by <a href="Airborne%20forces">paratroops</a> of the <a href="503rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">503rd Parachute Infantry</a>. His B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but he insisted that it fly on to Nadzab. For this, he was awarded the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>.

The <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 7th</a> and 9th Divisions converged on Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th to capture <a href="Battle%20of%20Kaiapit">Kaiapit</a> and <a href="Finisterre%20Range%20campaign">Dumpu</a>, while the 9th mounted an <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">amphibious assault on Finschhafen</a>. Here, the offensive bogged down, partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.

In early November, MacArthur's plan for a westward advance along the coast of New Guinea to the Philippines was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan. Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>. Although Willoughby did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing there, commencing the <a href="Admiralty%20Islands%20campaign">Admiralty Islands campaign</a>. He accompanied the assault force aboard the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , the flagship of Vice Admiral <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Kinkaid">Thomas C. Kinkaid</a>, the new commander of the Seventh Fleet, and came ashore seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, for which he was awarded the <a href="Bronze%20Star">Bronze Star</a>. It took six weeks of fierce fighting before the <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> captured the islands.

MacArthur had one of the most powerful PR machines of any Allied general during the war, which made him into an extremely popular war hero with the American people. In late 1943–early 1944, there was a serious effort by the conservative faction in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> centered in the Midwest to have MacArthur seek the Republican nomination to be the candidate for the presidency in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">1944 election</a>, as they regarded the two men most likely to win the Republican nomination, namely <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a> and Governor <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a> of New York, as too liberal. For a time, MacArthur, who had long seen himself as a potential president, was in the words of the U.S historian <a href="Gerhard%20Weinberg">Gerhard Weinberg</a> "very interested" in running as the Republican candidate in 1944. However, MacArthur's vow to "return" to the Philippines had not been fulfilled in early 1944 and he decided not to run for president until he had liberated the Philippines.

Furthermore, Weinberg had argued that it is probable that Roosevelt, who knew of the "enormous gratuity" MacArthur had accepted from Quezon in 1942, had used his knowledge of this transaction to blackmail MacArthur into not running for president. Finally, despite the best efforts of the conservative Republicans to put MacArthur's name on the ballot, on April 4, 1944, Governor Dewey won such a convincing victory in the Wisconsin primary (regarded as a significant victory given that the Midwest was a stronghold of the conservative Republicans opposed to Dewey) as to ensure that he would win the Republican nomination to be the GOP's candidate for president in 1944.

MacArthur now bypassed the Japanese forces at <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a> and <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>, and assaulted <a href="Landing%20at%20Hollandia">Hollandia</a> and <a href="Landing%20at%20Aitape">Aitape</a>, which Willoughby reported to be lightly defended based on intelligence gathered in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sio">Battle of Sio</a>. MacArthur's bold thrust by going 600 miles up the coast had surprised and confused the Japanese high command, who had not anticipated that MacArthur would take such risks. Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the <a href="Ramu">Ramu Valley</a>, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of Nimitz's <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a> to provide air support. Though risky, the operation turned out to be another success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General <a href="Hataz%C5%8D%20Adachi">Hatazō Adachi</a>'s <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Japanese XVIII Army</a> in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. While bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the strategic drawback of tying up Allied troops to contain them. Moreover, Adachi was far from beaten, which he demonstrated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Driniumor%20River">Battle of Driniumor River</a>.

In July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in Hawaii "to determine the phase of action against Japan". Nimitz made the case for attacking Formosa. MacArthur stressed America's moral obligation to liberate the Philippines. In September, Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>'s carriers made a series of air strikes on the Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey concluded, incorrectly, that <a href="Leyte">Leyte</a> was "wide open" and possibly undefended, and recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte.

On 20 October 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte">landed on Leyte</a>, while MacArthur watched from the light cruiser . That afternoon he arrived off the beach. The advance had not progressed far; snipers were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. When his whaleboat grounded in knee-deep water, MacArthur requested a landing craft, but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request. MacArthur was compelled to wade ashore. In his prepared speech, he said:
Since Leyte was out of range of Kenney's land-based aircraft, MacArthur was dependent on carrier aircraft. Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on <a href="Tacloban">Tacloban</a>, where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on "Nashville"s bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit. Over the next few days, the Japanese counterattacked in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, resulting in a near-disaster that MacArthur attributed to the command being divided between himself and Nimitz. Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. Heavy monsoonal rains disrupted the airbase construction program. Carrier aircraft proved to be no substitute for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese to pour troops into Leyte. Adverse weather and tough Japanese resistance slowed the American advance, resulting in a protracted campaign.

By the end of December, Krueger's headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on 26 December MacArthur issued a communiqué announcing that "the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up". Yet <a href="Robert%20L.%20Eichelberger">Eichelberger</a>'s <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth Army</a> killed another 27,000 Japanese on Leyte before the campaign ended in May 1945. On 18 December 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new <a href="five-star%20rank">five-star rank</a> of <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a>, placing him in the company of Marshall, Eisenhower, <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry "Hap" Arnold</a>, the only four men to achieve the rank in World War II. Including <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, MacArthur was one of only five men to achieve the title of General of the Army since the 5 August 1888 death of <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, and he was one of only five American officers to hold the rank as a five-star general. MacArthur was senior to all but Marshall. The rank was created by an <a href="Act%20of%20Congress">Act of Congress</a> when <a href="Act%20of%20Congress">Public Law</a> was passed on 14 December 1944, as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war. The temporary rank was then declared permanent 23 March 1946 by Public Law 333 of the <a href="79th%20Congress">79th Congress</a>, which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list.

MacArthur's next move was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mindoro">invasion of Mindoro</a>, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the <a href="Sulu%20Sea">Sulu Sea</a>, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on "Nashville". As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" struck "Nashville", killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by "kamikazes". During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not be taken to the Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.
The way was now clear for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Luzon">invasion of Luzon</a>. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby estimated the strength of General <a href="Tomoyuki%20Yamashita">Tomoyuki Yamashita</a>'s forces on Luzon at 137,000, while Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. MacArthur's response was "Bunk!". He felt that even Willoughby's estimate was too high. "Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur's attributes", and he disregarded the estimates. In fact, they were too low; Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon. This time, MacArthur traveled aboard the light cruiser , watching as the ship was nearly hit by a bomb and torpedoes fired by <a href="midget%20submarine">midget submarine</a>s. His communiqué read: "The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest Pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops."

MacArthur's primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were required to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to <a href="Hacienda%20Luisita">Hacienda Luisita</a>, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral <a href="Sanji%20Iwabuchi">Sanji Iwabuchi</a> had decided to defend Manila to the death. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Manila%20%281945%29">Battle of Manila</a> raged for the next three weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.

After taking Manila, MacArthur installed one of his Filipino friends, <a href="Manuel%20Roxas">Manuel Roxas</a>—who also happened to be one of the few people who knew about the huge sum of money Quezon had given MacArthur in 1942—into a position of power that ensured Roxas was to become the next Filipino president. Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of José Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian <a href="Gerhard%20Weinberg">Gerhard Weinberg</a> wrote that "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort to address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.

After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur turned his attention to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.

Although MacArthur had no specific directive to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed his forces to liberate the remainder of the Philippines. In the GHQ communiqué on 5 July, he announced that the Philippines had been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon. Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">invasion of Borneo</a>. He accompanied the <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">assault on Labuan</a>, and visited the troops ashore. While returning to GHQ in Manila, he visited <a href="Davao%20City">Davao</a>, where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number surrendered. In July 1945, he was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.

As part of preparations for <a href="Operation%20Downfall">Operation Downfall</a>, the invasion of Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the <a href="Twentieth%20Air%20Force">Twentieth Air Force</a>. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the decision-makers in Washington that it was essential to have the Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial to have the Red Army tie down the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The invasion was pre-empted by the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">formal Japanese surrender</a> aboard the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Navy Distinguished Service Medal</a>.

On 29 August 1945, MacArthur was ordered to exercise authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a>. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the <a href="DN%20Tower%2021">Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building</a> in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, there was a certain partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and most of the rest of the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.
MacArthur took the view that a few "militarist" extremists had "hijacked" Japan starting in 1931 with the <a href="Mukden%20Incident">Mukden Incident</a>, the Emperor was a pro-Western "moderate" who had been powerless to stop the militarists, and thus bore no responsibility for any of the war crimes committed by the Japanese between 1931 and 1945. The American historian <a href="Herbert%20P.%20Bix">Herbert P. Bix</a> described the relationship between the general and the Emperor as: "the Allied commander would use the Emperor, and the Emperor would cooperate in being used. Their relationship became one of expediency and mutual protection, of more political benefit to Hirohito than to MacArthur because Hirohito had more to lose–the entire panoply of symbolic, legitimizing properties of the imperial throne".

At the same time, MacArthur undermined the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous picture of his first meeting with the Emperor, the impact of which on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur on the grounds that it damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.

As he needed the Emperor, MacArthur protected him from any effort to hold accountable for his actions, and allowed him to issue statements that incorrectly portrayed the emerging democratic post-war era as a continuation of the Meiji era reforms. MacArthur did not allow any investigations of the Emperor, and instead in October 1945 ordered his staff "in the interests of peaceful occupation and rehabilitation of Japan, prevention of revolution and communism, all facts surrounding the execution of the declaration of war and subsequent position of the Emperor which tend to show fraud, menace or duress be marshalled". In January 1946, MacArthur reported to Washington that the Emperor could not be indicted for war crimes on the grounds: 

To protect the Emperor from being indicted, MacArthur had one of his staff, Brigadier General <a href="Bonner%20Fellers">Bonner Fellers</a> tell the "genrō" Admiral <a href="Mitsumasa%20Yonai">Mitsumasa Yonai</a> on 6 March 1946:

From the viewpoint of both sides, having one especially evil figure in the form of General <a href="Hideki%20Tojo">Hideki Tojo</a>, on whom everything that went wrong could be blamed, was most politically convenient. At a second meeting on 22 March 1946, Fellers told Yonai: 

MacArthur's attempts to shield the Emperor from indictment and to have all the blame taken by Tojo were successful, which as <a href="Herbert%20P.%20Bix">Herbert P. Bix</a> commented, "...had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on the Japanese understanding of the lost war".

MacArthur was responsible for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the <a href="International%20Military%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Far%20East">International Military Tribunal for the Far East</a>. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the <a href="Rape%20of%20Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a>, the <a href="Bataan%20Death%20March">Bataan Death March</a> and <a href="Manila%20massacre">Manila massacre</a>. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and of which he was probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.

MacArthur gave immunity to <a href="Shiro%20Ishii">Shiro Ishii</a> and other members of the <a href="Unit%20731">bacteriological research units</a> in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including princes such as <a href="Prince%20Chichibu">Chichibu</a>, <a href="Prince%20Asaka%20Yasuhiko">Asaka</a>, <a href="Prince%20Takeda%20Tsuneyoshi">Takeda</a>, <a href="Prince%20Higashikuni%20Naruhiko">Higashikuni</a> and <a href="Hiroyasu%20Fushimi">Fushimi</a>, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's <a href="abdication">abdication</a> would not be necessary. In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.

As <a href="Supreme%20Commander%20for%20the%20Allied%20Powers">Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers</a> (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and his staff helped Japan rebuild itself, eradicate militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Japan">constitution</a> that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary system</a> of government, under which the Emperor acted only on the advice of his ministers. It included the famous <a href="Article%209%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Constitution">Article 9</a>, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.

A major <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> was also conducted, led by <a href="Wolf%20Ladejinsky">Wolf Ladejinsky</a> of MacArthur's SCAP staff. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately , or 38% of Japan's cultivated land, was purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program, and was resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated. MacArthur's efforts to encourage trade union membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur's reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his unilateral control of Japan was ended by the increased involvement of the State Department. During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the <a href="Zaibatsu">Zaibatsu</a>, which had previously monopolized industry. Eventually, looser industrial groupings known as "<a href="Keiretsu">Keiretsu</a>" evolved. The reforms alarmed many in the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, who believed they conflicted with the prospect of Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.

In 1948, MacArthur made a bid to win the Republican nomination to be the GOP candidate for president, which was the most serious of several efforts he made over the years. MacArthur's status as one of America's most popular war heroes together with his reputation as the statesman who had "transformed" Japan gave him a strong basis for running for president, but MacArthur's lack of connections within the GOP were a major handicap. MacArthur's strongest supporters came from the quasi-isolationist, Midwestern wing of the Republicans and embraced men such as Brigadier General <a href="Hanford%20MacNider">Hanford MacNider</a>, <a href="Philip%20La%20Follette">Philip La Follette</a>, and Brigadier General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Wood">Robert E. Wood</a>, a diverse collection of "Old Right" and Progressive Republicans only united by a belief that the U.S. was too much involved in Europe for its own good. MacArthur declined to campaign for the presidency himself, but he privately encouraged his supporters to put his name on the ballot. MacArthur had always stated he would retire when a peace treaty was signed with Japan, and his push in the fall of 1947 to have the U.S sign a peace treaty with Japan was intended to allow him to retire on a high note, and thus campaign for the presidency. For the same reasons, Truman subverted MacArthur's efforts to have peace treaty signed in 1947, saying that more time was needed before the U.S could formally make peace with Japan.

Without a peace treaty, MacArthur decided not to resign while at the same time writing letters to Wood saying he would be more than happy to accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by <a href="Harold%20Stassen">Harold Stassen</a>. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the <a href="1948%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1948 Republican National Convention</a> which was won by Governor <a href="Thomas%20Dewey">Thomas Dewey</a> of New York.

In an address to Congress on 19 April 1951, MacArthur declared: 

MacArthur handed over power to the Japanese government in 1949, but remained in Japan until relieved by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> on 11 April 1951. The <a href="San%20Francisco%20Peace%20Treaty">San Francisco Peace Treaty</a>, signed on 8 September 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on 28 April 1952, Japan was once again an independent state. The Japanese subsequently gave him the nickname "Gaijin Shogun" ("foreign military ruler") but not until around the time of his death in 1964.
On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> passed <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%2082">Resolution 82</a>, which authorized a United Nations (UN) force to assist South Korea. The UN empowered the American government to select a commander, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously recommended MacArthur. He therefore became Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command (UNCOM), while remaining SCAP in Japan and Commander of the USAFFE. All South Korean forces were also placed under his command. As they retreated before the North Korean onslaught, MacArthur received permission to commit U.S. ground forces. All the first units to arrive could do was trade men and ground for time, falling back to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan%20Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a>. By the end of August, the crisis subsided. North Korean attacks on the perimeter had tapered off. While the North Korean force numbered 88,000 troops, Lieutenant General <a href="Walton%20Walker">Walton Walker</a>'s Eighth Army now numbered 180,000, and he had more tanks and artillery pieces.
In 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General of the Army <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, had predicted that "large scale combined amphibious operations ... will never occur again", but by July 1950, MacArthur was planning just such an operation. MacArthur compared his plan with that of General <a href="James%20Wolfe">James Wolfe</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">Battle of the Plains of Abraham</a>, and brushed aside the problems of tides, <a href="hydrography">hydrography</a> and terrain. In September, despite lingering concerns from superiors, MacArthur's soldiers and marines made a successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">landing at Inchon</a>, deep behind North Korean lines. Launched with naval and close air support, the landing outflanked the North Koreans, recaptured <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> and forced them to retreat northward in disarray. Visiting the battlefield on 17 September, MacArthur surveyed six <a href="T-34">T-34</a> tanks that had been knocked out by Marines, ignoring sniper fire around him, except to note that the North Korean marksmen were poorly trained.

On 11 September, Truman issued orders for an advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea. MacArthur now planned another amphibious assault, on <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a> on the east coast, but it fell to South Korean troops before the 1st Marine Division could reach it by sea. In October, MacArthur met with Truman at the <a href="Wake%20Island%20Conference">Wake Island Conference</a>, with Truman emulating Roosevelt's wartime meeting with MacArthur in Hawaii. The president awarded MacArthur his fifth Distinguished Service Medal. Briefly questioned about the Chinese threat, MacArthur dismissed it, saying that he hoped to be able to withdraw the Eighth Army to Japan by Christmas, and to release a division for service in Europe in January. He regarded the possibility of Soviet intervention as a more serious threat.

A month later, things had changed. The enemy were engaged by the UN forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Unsan">Battle of Unsan</a> in late October, which demonstrated the presence of Chinese soldiers in Korea and rendered significant losses to the American and other UN troops. Nevertheless, Willoughby downplayed the evidence about Chinese intervention in the war. He estimated that up to 71,000 Chinese soldiers were in the country, while the true number was closer to 300,000. He was not alone in this miscalculation. On 24 November, the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> reported to Truman that while there could be as many as 200,000 Chinese troops in Korea, "there is no evidence that the Chinese Communists plan major offensive operations."

That day, MacArthur flew to Walker's headquarters and he later wrote: MacArthur flew over the front line himself in his <a href="Douglas%20C-54%20Skymaster">Douglas C-54 Skymaster</a> but saw no signs of a Chinese build up and therefore decided to wait before ordering an advance or withdrawal. Evidence of the Chinese activity was hidden to MacArthur: the Chinese Army traveled at night and dug in during the day. For his reconnaissance efforts, MacArthur was nonetheless awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> and honorary <a href="United%20States%20Aviator%20Badge">combat pilot's wings</a>.

The next day, 25 November 1950, Walker's Eighth Army was attacked by the Chinese Army and soon the UN forces were in retreat. MacArthur provided the Chief of Staff, General <a href="J.%20Lawton%20Collins">J. Lawton Collins</a> with a series of nine successive withdrawal lines. On 23 December, Walker was killed when his jeep collided with a truck, and was replaced by Lieutenant General <a href="Matthew%20Ridgway">Matthew Ridgway</a>, whom MacArthur had selected in case of such an eventuality. Ridgway noted that MacArthur's "prestige, which had gained an extraordinary luster after <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">Inch'on</a>, was badly tarnished. His credibility suffered in the unforeseen outcome of the November offensive ..."

Collins discussed the possible use of nuclear weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the use of nuclear weapons. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.

In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the <a href="Shantung%20Peninsula">Shantung Peninsula</a> if the Chinese launched airstrikes originating from there against his forces. The next day Truman met with the chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, <a href="Gordon%20Dean%20%28lawyer%29">Gordon Dean</a>, and arranged for the transfer of nine <a href="Mark%204%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 4 nuclear bomb</a>s to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a>.

Within weeks of the Chinese attack, MacArthur was forced to retreat from North Korea. Seoul fell in January 1951, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely. European countries did not share MacArthur's world view, distrusted his judgment, and were afraid that he might use his stature and influence with the American public to re-focus American policy away from Europe and towards Asia. They were concerned that this might lead to a major war with China, possibly involving nuclear weapons. Since in February 1950 the Soviet Union and China had signed a defensive alliance committing each to go to war if the other party was attacked, the possibility that an American attack on China would cause World War III was considered to be very real at the time. In a visit to the United States in December 1950, the British prime minister, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, had raised the fears of the British and other European governments that "General MacArthur was running the show".

Under Ridgway's command, the Eighth Army pressed north again in January. He inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and pushed on to the 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China to admit that it had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.

On 5 April, Representative <a href="Joseph%20William%20Martin%2C%20Jr.">Joseph William Martin, Jr.</a>, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, read aloud on the floor of the House a letter from MacArthur critical of Truman's Europe-first policy and limited-war strategy. The letter concluded with:
In March 1951 secret United States intercepts of diplomatic dispatches disclosed clandestine conversations in which General MacArthur expressed confidence to the Tokyo embassies of Spain and Portugal that he would succeed in expanding the Korean War into a full-scale conflict with the Chinese Communists. When the intercepts came to the attention of President Truman, he was enraged to learn that MacArthur was not only trying to increase public support for his position on conducting the war, but had secretly informed foreign governments that he planned to initiate actions that were counter to United States policy. The President was unable to act immediately since he could not afford to reveal the existence of the intercepts and because of MacArthur's popularity with the public and political support in Congress. However, following the release on April 5 by Representative Martin of MacArthur's letter, Truman concluded he could relieve MacArthur of his commands without incurring unacceptable political damage.

Truman summoned Secretary of Defense George Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Omar Bradley, Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> and <a href="Averell%20Harriman">Averell Harriman</a> to discuss what to do about MacArthur. They concurred MacArthur should be relieved of his command, but made no recommendation to do so. Although they felt that it was correct "from a purely military point of view", they were aware that there were important political considerations as well. Truman and Acheson agreed that MacArthur was insubordinate, but the Joint Chiefs avoided any suggestion of this. Insubordination was a military offense, and MacArthur could have requested a public court martial similar to that of Billy Mitchell. The outcome of such a trial was uncertain, and it might well have found him not guilty and ordered his reinstatement. The Joint Chiefs agreed that there was "little evidence that General MacArthur had ever failed to carry out a direct order of the Joint Chiefs, or acted in opposition to an order". "In point of fact", Bradley insisted, "MacArthur had stretched but not legally violated any JCS directives. He had violated the President's 6 December directive [not to make public statements on policy matters], relayed to him by the JCS, but this did not constitute violation of a JCS order." Truman ordered MacArthur's relief by Ridgway, and the order went out on 10 April with Bradley's signature.

In a 3 December 1973 article in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, Truman was quoted as saying in the early 1960s:
The relief of the famous general by the unpopular politician for communicating with Congress led to a <a href="constitutional%20crisis">constitutional crisis</a>, and a storm of public controversy. Polls showed that the majority of the public disapproved of the decision to relieve MacArthur. By February 1952, almost nine months later, Truman's approval rating had fallen to 22 percent. , that remains the lowest <a href="Gallup%20Poll">Gallup Poll</a> approval rating recorded by any serving president. As the increasingly unpopular war in Korea dragged on, Truman's administration was beset with a series of corruption scandals, and he eventually decided not to run for re-election. Beginning on 3 May 1951, a Joint Senate Committee—chaired by Democrat <a href="Richard%20Russell%2C%20Jr.">Richard Russell, Jr.</a>—investigated MacArthur's removal. It concluded that "the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride".

A day after his arrival in San Francisco from Korea on 18 April 1951, MacArthur had flown with his family to Washington, D.C. where he was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress. It was his and Jean's first visit to the continental United States since 1937, when they had been married; Arthur IV, now aged 13, had never been to the U.S. And, on April 19, 1951, MacArthur made his last official appearance in a farewell address to the U.S. Congress presenting and defending his side of his disagreement with Truman over the conduct of the Korean War. During his speech, he was interrupted by fifty ovations. MacArthur ended the address saying:
MacArthur received public adulation, which aroused expectations that he would run for president, but he was not a candidate. MacArthur carried out a speaking tour in 1951–52 attacking the Truman administration for "appeasement in Asia" and for mismanaging the economy. Initially attracting large crowds, by early 1952 MacArthur's speeches were attracting smaller and smaller numbers of people as many complained that MacArthur seemed more interested in settling scores with Truman and praising himself than in offering up a constructive vision for the nation. MacArthur felt uncomfortable campaigning for the Republican nomination, and hoped that at the Republican convention, a deadlock would ensue between Senator Robert Taft and General Eisenhower, which would end with the GOP nominating him as the best compromise. MacArthur's unwillingness to campaign for the presidency seriously hurt his ability to win the nomination. In the end, MacArthur endorsed Senator <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a>, and was keynote speaker at the <a href="1952%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1952 Republican National Convention</a>. Taft lost the nomination to Eisenhower, who went on to win the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201952">1952 election</a> by a landslide. Once elected, Eisenhower consulted with MacArthur about ending the war in Korea.
Douglas and Jean MacArthur spent their last years together in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, a part of the <a href="Waldorf-Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a>. He was elected chairman of the board of <a href="Remington%20Rand">Remington Rand</a>. In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General <a href="Leif%20J.%20Sverdrup">Leif J. Sverdrup</a>. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.

After his recovery, MacArthur methodically began to carry out the closing acts of his life. He visited the White House for a final reunion with Eisenhower. In 1961, he made a "sentimental journey" to the Philippines, where he was decorated by President <a href="Carlos%20P.%20Garcia">Carlos P. Garcia</a> with the <a href="Philippine%20Legion%20of%20Honor">Philippine Legion of Honor</a>. MacArthur also accepted a $900,000 (equivalent to $7.25 million in 2016) advance from Henry Luce for the rights to his memoirs, and wrote the volume that would eventually be published as "Reminiscences". Sections began to appear in serialized form in "<a href="Life%20magazine">Life magazine</a>" in the months before his death.

President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> solicited MacArthur's counsel in 1961. The first of two meetings was held shortly after the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pigs%20Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems should be given a much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>.

In 1962, West Point honored the increasingly frail MacArthur with the <a href="Sylvanus%20Thayer%20Award">Sylvanus Thayer Award</a> for outstanding service to the nation, which had gone to Eisenhower the year before. MacArthur's speech to the cadets in accepting the award had as its theme "Duty, Honor, Country": 

In 1963, President Kennedy asked MacArthur to help mediate a dispute between the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> and the <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> over control of amateur sports in the country. The dispute threatened to derail the participation of the United States in the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a>. His presence helped to broker a deal, and participation in the games went on as planned.

Douglas MacArthur died at <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center">Walter Reed Army Medical Center</a> on 5 April 1964, of <a href="Primary%20biliary%20cirrhosis">biliary cirrhosis</a>. Kennedy had authorized a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> before <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">his own death</a> in 1963, and Johnson confirmed the directive, ordering that MacArthur be buried "with all the honor a grateful nation can bestow on a departed hero". On 7 April his body was taken to New York City, where it lay in an open casket at the <a href="Seventh%20Regiment%20Armory">Seventh Regiment Armory</a> for about 12 hours. That night it was taken on a funeral train to <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Union Station</a> and transported by a funeral procession to the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">Capitol</a>, where it <a href="lying%20in%20state%23United%20States">lay in state</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">United States Capitol rotunda</a>. An estimated 150,000 people filed by the <a href="bier">bier</a>.

MacArthur had requested to be buried in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, where his mother had been born and where his parents had married. Accordingly, on 11 April, his funeral service was held in <a href="Saint%20Paul%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Norfolk%2C%20Virginia%29">St Paul's Episcopal Church</a> in Norfolk and his body was finally laid to rest in the rotunda of the <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur%20Memorial">Douglas MacArthur Memorial</a> (the former Norfolk City Hall and later courthouse).

In 1960, the mayor of Norfolk had proposed using funds raised by public contribution to remodel the old Norfolk City Hall as a memorial to General MacArthur and as a repository for his papers, decorations, and mementos he had accepted. Restored and remodeled, the <a href="MacArthur%20Memorial">MacArthur Memorial</a> contains nine museum galleries whose contents reflect the general's 50 years of military service. At the heart of the memorial is a rotunda. In its center lies a sunken circular crypt with two marble sarcophagi, one for MacArthur, the other for Jean, who continued to live in the Waldorf Towers until her own death in 2000.

The MacArthur Chambers in Brisbane, Australia, hosts the <a href="MacArthur%20Museum%2C%20Brisbane">MacArthur Museum</a> on the 8th floor where MacArthur had his office.
MacArthur has a contested legacy. In the Philippines in 1942, he suffered a defeat that <a href="Gavin%20Long">Gavin Long</a> described as "the greatest in the history of American foreign wars". Despite this, "in a fragile period of the American psyche when the general American public, still stunned by the shock of Pearl Harbor and uncertain what lay ahead in Europe, desperately needed a hero, they wholeheartedly embraced Douglas MacArthur—good press copy that he was. There simply were no other choices that came close to matching his mystique, not to mention his evocative lone-wolf stand—something that has always resonated with Americans."

MacArthur's concept of the role of the soldier as encompassing a broad spectrum of roles that included civil affairs, quelling riots and low-level conflict, was dismissed by the majority of officers who had fought in Europe during World War II, and afterwards saw the Army's role as fighting the Soviet Union. Unlike them, in his victories in New Guinea in 1944, the Philippines in 1945 and Korea in 1950, he fought outnumbered, and relied on maneuver and surprise for success. The American Sinologist John Fairbank called MacArthur "our greatest soldier".

On the other hand, Truman once remarked that he did not understand how the US Army could "produce men such as <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, John J. Pershing, Eisenhower and Bradley and at the same time produce <a href="George%20A.%20Custer">Custers</a>, <a href="George%20S.%20Patton%2C%20Jr.">Pattons</a> and MacArthur". His relief of MacArthur cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations for decades. When Lyndon Johnson met with <a href="William%20Westmoreland">William Westmoreland</a> in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: "General, I have a lot riding on you. I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me." MacArthur's relief "left a lasting current of popular sentiment that in matters of war and peace, the military really knows best", a philosophy which became known as "MacArthurism".

MacArthur remains a controversial and enigmatic figure. He has been portrayed as a reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often out of step with his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. As such, MacArthur implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a> once said, "The best and the worst things you hear about him are both true."

During his lifetime, MacArthur earned over 100 military decorations from the U.S. and other countries including the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, the French "<a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Légion d'honneur</a>" and "<a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de guerre</a>", the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20Italy">Order of the Crown of Italy</a>, the <a href="Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Order of Orange-Nassau</a> from the Netherlands, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath</a> from Australia, and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun%231st%20Class%2C%20Order%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun%20with%20Paulownia%20Flowers%2C%20Grand%20Cordon">Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, Grand Cordon</a> from Japan.

MacArthur was enormously popular with the American public. Streets, public works, and children were named after him. Even a dance step was named after him. In 1955, his promotion to <a href="General%20of%20the%20Armies">General of the Armies</a> was proposed in Congress, but the proposal was shelved.

Since 1987 the General Douglas MacArthur Leadership Awards are presented annually by the United States Army on behalf of the General Douglas MacArthur Foundation to recognize company grade officers (lieutenants and captains) and junior warrant officers (warrant officer one and chief warrant officer two) who have demonstrated the attributes of "duty, honor, country" in their professional lives and in service to their communities.

The General Douglas MacArthur Foundation presents the MacArthur Cadet Awards in recognition of outstanding cadets within the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States. The MacArthur Award is presented annually to seniors at these military schools. The award is designed to encourage cadets to emulate the leadership qualities shown by General Douglas MacArthur, as a student at West Texas Military Institute and the U.S. Military Academy. Approximately 40 schools are authorized to provide the award to its top cadet each year.

The MacArthur Leadership Award at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%20of%20Canada">Royal Military College of Canada</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a> is awarded to the graduating officer cadet who demonstrates outstanding leadership performance based on the credo of Duty-Honor-Country and potential for future military service.

Several actors have portrayed MacArthur on-screen.

Yosemite National Park

Yosemite National Park ( ) is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> located in the western <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> of <a href="Central%20California">Central</a> <a href="California">California</a>, bounded on the southeast by <a href="Sierra%20National%20Forest">Sierra National Forest</a> and on the northwest by <a href="Stanislaus%20National%20Forest">Stanislaus National Forest</a>. The park is managed by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> and covers an area of and sits in four <a href="County">counties</a>: centered in <a href="Tuolumne%20County%2C%20California">Tuolumne</a> and <a href="Mariposa%20County%2C%20California">Mariposa</a>, extending north and east to <a href="Mono%20County%2C%20California">Mono</a> and south to <a href="Madera%20County%2C%20California">Madera County</a>. Designated a <a href="World%20Heritage%20site">World Heritage site</a> in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, <a href="Sequoiadendron%20giganteum">giant sequoia</a> groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and <a href="Biodiversity">biological diversity</a>. Almost 95% of the park is designated <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness</a>.

On average, about 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, and most spend the majority of their time in the of <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>. The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing 5 million visitors for the first time in its history. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. <a href="Galen%20Clark">Galen Clark</a> and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s signing the <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park%23Yosemite%20Grant">Yosemite Grant</a> in 1864. <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> led a successful movement to have <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> establish a larger national park by 1890, one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests, paving the way for the <a href="National%20Park%20Service%23National%20Park%20System">National Park System</a>.

Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals. The park has an elevation range from and contains five major <a href="life%20zone">vegetation zones</a>: <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a> woodland, <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20lower%20montane%20forest">lower montane forest</a>, upper <a href="Montane%20ecosystems%23Montane%20forests">montane forest</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20subalpine%20zone">subalpine zone</a>, and <a href="alpine%20tundra">alpine</a>. Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% are within Yosemite. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local <a href="geology">geologic</a> formations and unique <a href="soil">soil</a>s characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.

The <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Yosemite%20area">geology of the Yosemite area</a> is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes. The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in the formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the <a href="U-shaped%20valley">U-shaped valley</a> that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.

The name "Yosemite" (meaning "killer" in <a href="Miwok">Miwok</a>) originally referred to the name of a renegade tribe which was driven out of the area (and possibly annihilated) by the <a href="Mariposa%20Battalion">Mariposa Battalion</a>. Previously, the area had been called "Ahwahnee" ("big mouth") by indigenous people.

Yosemite Valley has been inhabited for nearly 3,000 years, although humans may have first visited the area as long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The indigenous natives called themselves the <a href="Ahwahnechee">Ahwahnechee</a>, meaning "dwellers in Ahwahnee." They are related to the Northern <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Paiute</a> and <a href="Mono%20%28tribe%29">Mono</a> tribes. Many tribes visited the area to trade, including nearby Central <a href="Sierra%20Miwoks">Sierra Miwoks</a>, who lived along the drainage area of the <a href="Tuolumne%20River">Tuolumne</a> and <a href="Stanislaus%20River">Stanislaus</a> Rivers. A major trading route went over <a href="Mono%20Pass%20%28Yosemite%29">Mono Pass</a> and through <a href="Bloody%20Canyon">Bloody Canyon</a> to <a href="Mono%20Lake">Mono Lake</a>, just to the east of the Yosemite area. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to that present today; acorns were a staple to their diet, as well as other seeds and plants, salmon and deer.

The <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> in the mid-19th century dramatically increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on. In 1851 as part of the Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> Major <a href="Jim%20Savage">Jim Savage</a> led the <a href="Mariposa%20Battalion">Mariposa Battalion</a> into the west end of Yosemite Valley. He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by <a href="Chief%20Tenaya">Chief Tenaya</a>.

Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of ethnic Europeans entering Yosemite Valley. Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. <a href="Lafayette%20Bunnell">Lafayette Bunnell</a>, the company physician, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in "The Discovery of the Yosemite". Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief Tenaya. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Ah-wah-nee colony. The <a href="Miwok">Miwok</a>, a neighboring tribe, and most white settlers considered the Ahwahneechee to be especially violent because of their frequent territorial disputes. The Miwok term for the Pai-Ute band was "yohhe'meti," meaning "they are killers". Correspondence and articles written by members of the battalion helped to popularize the natural wonders of the Yosemite Valley and the surrounding area.
Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were eventually captured and their village burned; they were removed to a <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> near <a href="Fresno%2C%20California">Fresno, California</a>. The chief and some others were later allowed to return to Yosemite Valley. In the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement. Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby <a href="Mono%20tribe">Mono tribe</a> of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts and moved away, but the Mono Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya. The Mono Paiute took the survivors as captives back to Mono Lake and absorbed them into the <a href="Mono%20Lake%20Paiute">Mono Lake Paiute</a> tribe.

After these wars, a number of Native Americans continued to live within the boundaries of Yosemite. A number of Indians supported the growing tourism industry by working as laborers or maids. Later, Indians became part of the tourism industry itself by selling baskets or performing for tourists.
A reconstructed "Indian Village of Ahwahnee" has been erected behind the <a href="Yosemite%20Museum">Yosemite Museum</a>, located next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.

In 1855, entrepreneur <a href="James%20Mason%20Hutchings">James Mason Hutchings</a>, artist <a href="Thomas%20Ayres%20%28artist%29">Thomas Ayres</a> and two others were the first to tour the area. Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, writing articles and <a href="Hutchings%27%20Illustrated%20California%20Magazine">special magazine issues about the Valley</a>. Ayres' style in art was highly detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.

<a href="Wawona%2C%20California">Wawona</a> was an Indian encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Settler <a href="Galen%20Clark">Galen Clark</a> discovered the <a href="Mariposa%20Grove">Mariposa Grove</a> of <a href="giant%20sequoia">giant sequoia</a> in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings built, and roads to the area. In 1879, the <a href="Wawona%20Hotel">Wawona Hotel</a> was built to serve tourists visiting Mariposa Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number of trails and hotels developed by people intending to build on the trade.

The <a href="Wawona%20Tree">Wawona Tree</a>, also known as the Tunnel Tree, was a famous giant sequoia that stood in the Mariposa Grove. It was tall, and was in circumference. When a carriage-wide tunnel was cut through the tree in 1881, it became even more popular as a tourist photo attraction. Everything from horse-drawn carriages in the late 19th century, to automobiles in the first part of the 20th century, traveled the road which passed through that tree. The Wawona Tree fell in 1969 under a heavy load of snow. It was estimated to have been 2,300 years old.

Yosemite's first concession was established in 1884 when John Degnan and his wife established a bakery and store. In 1916, the National Park Service granted a 20-year concession to the Desmond Park Service Company. It bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services. Desmond changed its name to the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.

The Curry Company had been started in 1899 by David and Jennie Curry to provide concessions in the park. They also founded Camp Curry, formerly known as <a href="Curry%20Village">Curry Village</a>, now known as Half Dome Village. The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to allow expansion of concession operations and development in the area.

Administrators in the National Park Service felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the <a href="Yosemite%20Park%20%26amp%3B%20Curry%20Company">Yosemite Park & Curry Company</a> (YP&CC). The company built the <a href="Ahwahnee%20Hotel">Ahwahnee Hotel</a> in 1927.

Concerned by the effects of commercial interests, prominent citizens including Galen Clark and Senator <a href="John%20Conness">John Conness</a> advocated for protection of the area. A park bill was prepared with the assistance of the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Department</a>. The bill passed both houses of the <a href="38th%20United%20States%20Congress">38th United States Congress</a>, and was signed by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and public use by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a> as the first <a href="national%20park">national park</a>. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to <a href="California">California</a> as a <a href="state%20park">state park</a>, and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later.

Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict <a href="Homestead%20Act">homesteaders</a> (which included Hutchings). The issue was not settled until 1872 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880, this dispute also reaching the Supreme Court in 1880. The two Supreme Court decisions affecting management of the Yosemite Grant are considered important precedents in land management law. Hutchings became the new park guardian.

Access to the park by tourists improved in the early years of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.

John Muir was a Scottish-born American naturalist and explorer. It was because of Muir that many National Parks were left untouched, such as Yosemite Valley National Park. One of the most significant camping trips Muir took was in 1903 with then president Theodore Roosevelt. This trip persuaded Roosevelt to return "Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to federal protection as part of Yosemite National Park".

<a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> wrote articles popularizing the area and increasing scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite Valley were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as <a href="Josiah%20Whitney">Josiah Whitney</a>, who regarded Muir as an amateur. Muir wrote scientific papers on the area's biology. Landscape architect <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> emphasized the importance of conservation of Yosemite Valley.

Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging of giant sequoia, and other damage caused Muir to become an advocate for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was <a href="Robert%20Underwood%20Johnson">Robert Underwood Johnson</a>, editor of "<a href="Century%20Magazine">Century Magazine</a>". Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.

The newly created national park came under the jurisdiction of the United States Army's Troop I of the <a href="4th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">4th Cavalry</a> on May 19, 1891, which set up camp in Wawona with Captain <a href="Abram%20Wood">Abram Epperson Wood</a> as acting superintendent. By the late 1890s, sheep grazing was no longer a problem, and the Army made other improvements. The cavalry could not intervene to ease the worsening condition of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. The cavalry left another legacy in the park, the ranger hat. From 1899 to 1913, cavalry regiments of the Western Department, including the all Black <a href="9th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">9th Cavalry</a> (known as the "Buffalo Soldiers") and the <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry</a>, stationed two troops at Yosemite and brought with them the trooper's campaign hat with its distinctive Montana Peak we recognize today as the "ranger hat." This peak had been formed into the trooper's stetson by veterans of the 1898 Spanish–American War to better shed tropical rain.
Muir and his <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> camped with Muir near <a href="Glacier%20Point">Glacier Point</a> for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.

The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, <a href="Tioga%20Pass%20Road">Tioga Pass Road</a>, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of <a href="Ansel%20Franklin%20Hall">Ansel Franklin Hall</a>.In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many of the Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from Yosemite in the 1960s.

In 1903, a dam in the northern portion of the park was proposed. Located in the <a href="Hetch%20Hetchy%20Valley">Hetch Hetchy Valley</a>, its purpose was to provide water and <a href="hydroelectric%20power">hydroelectric power</a> to <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a>, supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the <a href="O%27Shaughnessy%20Dam%20%28California%29">O'Shaughnessy Dam</a> through passage of the <a href="Raker%20Act">Raker Act</a>.
In the late 1920s a <a href="Bids%20for%20Olympic%20Games%23All-time%20Winter%20Olympics%20bids">bid</a> for Yosemite for the <a href="1932%20Winter%20Olympics">1932 Winter Olympics</a> was put forward. Ultimately, the 1932 Winter Olympics were awarded to <a href="Lake%20Placid%2C%20New%20York">Lake Placid, New York</a>. In 1937, conservationist <a href="Rosalie%20Edge">Rosalie Edge</a>, head of the Emergency Conservation Committee (ECC), successfully lobbied Congress to purchase about 8,000 acres of old-growth sugar pines on the perimeter of Yosemite National Park that were to be logged.

More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a>. The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the "<a href="Yosemite%20Firefall">Firefall</a>", in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. <a href="Traffic%20congestion">Traffic congestion</a> in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.

In 2016, <a href="The%20Trust%20for%20Public%20Land">The Trust for Public Land</a> purchased Ackerson Meadow, a 400-acre tract on the western edge of Yosemite National Park, for $2.3 million in order to preserve habitat and protect the area from development. Ackerson Meadow was originally included in the proposed 1890 park boundary but never acquired by the federal government. On September 7, 2016, the National Park Service accepted the donation of the land, making the meadow the largest addition to Yosemite since 1949.

Yosemite National Park is located in the central Sierra Nevada of California. Three wilderness areas are adjacent to Yosemite: the <a href="Ansel%20Adams%20Wilderness">Ansel Adams Wilderness</a> to the southeast, the <a href="Hoover%20Wilderness">Hoover Wilderness</a> to the northeast, and the <a href="Emigrant%20Wilderness">Emigrant Wilderness</a> to the north.

The park is roughly the size of the U.S. state of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and contains thousands of lakes and ponds, of streams, of hiking trails, and of roads. Two federally designated <a href="Wild%20and%20Scenic%20River">Wild and Scenic River</a>s, the <a href="Merced%20River">Merced</a> and the Tuolumne, begin within Yosemite's borders and flow westward through the Sierra foothills, into the <a href="California%20Central%20Valley">Central Valley of California</a>. On average, about 4 million people visit the park each year, with most visitor use concentrated in the seven-square-mile (18 km) area of <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>.

Almost all of the landforms in the Yosemite area are cut from the granitic rock of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20Batholith">Sierra Nevada Batholith</a> (a <a href="batholith">batholith</a> is a large mass of intrusive <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a> that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near <a href="Mount%20Dana">Mount Dana</a>) are <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphosed</a> <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic</a> and <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s. These rocks are called "<a href="roof%20pendants">roof pendants</a>" because they were once the roof of the underlying granitic rock.

<a href="Erosion">Erosion</a> acting upon different types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, <a href="dome%20%28geology%29">domes</a>, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a>. Spacing between joints is controlled by the amount of <a href="silica">silica</a> in the granite and <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a> rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.

Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, are created by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is responsible for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). <a href="Exfoliation%20%28geology%29">Exfoliation</a> (caused by the tendency of <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s in <a href="pluton">pluton</a>ic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as <a href="Half%20Dome">Half Dome</a> and <a href="North%20Dome">North Dome</a> and inset arches like Royal Arches.

Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The <a href="Tunnel%20View">Tunnel View</a> is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a>, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. <a href="Granite%20dome">Granite dome</a>s such as <a href="Sentinel%20Dome">Sentinel Dome</a> and <a href="Half%20Dome">Half Dome</a> rise , respectively, above the valley floor. In the park are <a href="Granite%20Domes%20of%20Yosemite%20National%20Park">many domes</a>.

The high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as <a href="Tuolumne%20Meadows">Tuolumne Meadows</a>, <a href="Dana%20Meadows%20%28California%29">Dana Meadows</a>, the <a href="Clark%20Range%20%28California%29">Clark Range</a>, the <a href="Cathedral%20Range">Cathedral Range</a>, and the <a href="Kuna%20Crest">Kuna Crest</a>. The Sierra crest and the <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a> run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and <a href="Mount%20Gibbs">Mount Gibbs</a>, and granite peaks, such as <a href="Mount%20Conness">Mount Conness</a>. <a href="Mount%20Lyell%20%28California%29">Mount Lyell</a> is the highest point in the park, standing at . The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada today.

The park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia ("Sequoiadendron giganteum") trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the <a href="Tuolumne%20Grove">Tuolumne Grove</a> (25 trees), and the <a href="Merced%20Grove">Merced Grove</a> (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.

The Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> in the park and have carved river canyons deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately . The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately .

Hydrologic processes, including <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park. The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m), two <a href="reservoir%20%28water%29">reservoirs</a>, and of streams, all of which help form these two large <a href="Drainage%20basin">watersheds</a>. <a href="Wetland">Wetland</a>s in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the <a href="riparian">riparian</a> habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers.
Yosemite is famous for its <a href="List%20of%20waterfalls%20in%20Yosemite%20National%20Park">high concentration of waterfalls</a> in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and <a href="hanging%20valley">hanging valley</a>s in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the <a href="Yosemite%20Falls">Yosemite Falls</a> is the highest in North America at . Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume <a href="Ribbon%20Fall">Ribbon Fall</a>s, which has the highest single vertical drop, . Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is <a href="Bridalveil%20Fall%20%28Yosemite%29">Bridalveil Fall</a>, which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of <a href="ephemeral">ephemeral</a> waterfalls also exist in the park.

All glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing <a href="cirque%20%28landform%29">cirques</a>. <a href="Lyell%20Glacier">Lyell Glacier</a> is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers . None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the much, much larger <a href="Ice%20Age">Ice Age</a> alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the <a href="neoglacial">neoglacial</a> episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>). <a href="Climate%20change">Climate change</a> has reduced the number and size of glaciers around the world. Many Yosemite glaciers, including Merced Glacier, which was discovered by John Muir in 1871 and bolstered his glacial origins theory of the Yosemite area, have disappeared and most of the others have lost up to 75% of their surface area.

Yosemite has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Csa"), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than 3% of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers). Because of <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a>, precipitation increases with elevation up to where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from at elevation to at . Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April.

Mean daily temperatures range from to at Tuolumne Meadows at . At the Wawona Entrance (elevation ), mean daily temperature ranges from . At the lower elevations below , temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation ) varies from . At elevations above , the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused <a href="wildfire">fires</a> as well.

At the park headquarters, with an elevation of , January averages , while July averages , though in summer the nights are much cooler than the hot days. There are an average of 39.5 days with highs of or higher and an average of 97.9 nights with freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have been recorded in every month of the year. The record high temperature was on July 20, 1915, while the record low temperature was on January 2, 1924 and on January 21, 1937. Average annual precipitation is nearly , falling on 65 days. The wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1976 with . The most precipitation in one month was in December 1955 and the most in one day was on December 23, 1955. Average annual snowfall is . The snowiest year was 1967 with . The most snow in one month was in January 1993.

The area of the park was astride a <a href="passive%20continental%20margin">passive continental margin</a> during the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> and early <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>. Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks have since been metamorphosed.

Heat generated from the <a href="Farallon%20Plate">Farallon Plate</a> <a href="subduction">subducting</a> below the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> led to the creation of an <a href="island%20arc">island arc</a> of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> and <a href="Permian">Permian</a> periods. Later volcanism in the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.

The first phase of regional <a href="intrusion%20%28geology%29">plutonism</a> started 210 million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years before present (<a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>). Around the same time, the <a href="Nevadan%20orogeny">Nevadan orogeny</a> built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of . This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and emplaced about below the surface. The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120 million to 80 million years ago during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. This was part of the <a href="Sevier%20orogeny">Sevier orogeny</a>.

Starting 20 million years ago (in the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>) and lasting until 5 million years ago, a now-extinct extension of <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and <a href="Long%20Valley%20Caldera">Long Valley</a> areas.

Starting 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the <a href="gradient">gradient</a> of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of <a href="Owens%20Valley">Owens Valley</a> from <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a>-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>.

The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting <a href="scree">talus</a> and <a href="till">till</a> from valley floors.

Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.

A series of glaciations further modified the region starting about 2 to 3 million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.

Glacial systems reached depths of up to and left their marks in the Yosemite area. The longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for , passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the highest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional <a href="moraine">moraine</a>s that impounded lakes such as the long Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley).

With its scrubby sun-baked <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a>, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands and meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra Nevada landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American settlement. In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park still contains some of <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a>. Taken together, the park's varied <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitats</a> support over 250 species of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Much of Yosemite's western boundary has habitats dominated by <a href="mixed%20coniferous%20forest">mixed coniferous forest</a>s of <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="sugar%20pine">sugar pine</a>, <a href="incense%20cedar">incense cedar</a>, <a href="white%20fir">white fir</a>, <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of <a href="California%20black%20oak">black oak</a> and <a href="Live%20oak">canyon live oak</a>. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>, <a href="mountain%20coyote">coyote</a>, raccoon, <a href="Kingsnake">mountain kingsnake</a>, <a href="Gilbert%27s%20skink">Gilbert's skink</a>, <a href="white-headed%20woodpecker">white-headed woodpecker</a>, bobcat, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a>, <a href="gray%20fox">gray fox</a>, <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>, <a href="brown%20creeper">brown creeper</a>, two species of skunk, <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>, <a href="spotted%20owl">spotted owl</a>, and a wide variety of bat species.

Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of <a href="Fir">red fir</a>, <a href="western%20white%20pine">western white pine</a>, <a href="Jeffrey%20pine">Jeffrey pine</a>, <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a>, and the occasional <a href="foxtail%20pine">foxtail pine</a>. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include <a href="golden-mantled%20ground%20squirrel">golden-mantled ground squirrel</a>, <a href="chickaree">chickaree</a>, <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">fisher</a>, <a href="Steller%27s%20jay">Steller's jay</a>, <a href="hermit%20thrush">hermit thrush</a>, and <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>. Reptiles are not common, but include <a href="rubber%20boa">rubber boa</a>, <a href="western%20fence%20lizard">western fence lizard</a>, and <a href="northern%20alligator%20lizard">northern alligator lizard</a>.
As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a>, and <a href="mountain%20hemlock">mountain hemlock</a> that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as <a href="American%20pika">pika</a>, <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>, white-tailed <a href="jackrabbit">jackrabbit</a>, <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a>, and <a href="black%20rosy%20finch">black rosy finch</a> are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20bighorn%20sheep">Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep</a>. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.

At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green <a href="Poaceae">grasses</a> and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include <a href="great%20grey%20owl">great grey owl</a>, <a href="willow%20flycatcher">willow flycatcher</a>, <a href="Yosemite%20toad">Yosemite toad</a>, and <a href="mountain%20beaver">mountain beaver</a>.

The black bears of Yosemite were once famous for breaking into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight for many years at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with <a href="bear-resistant%20food%20storage%20container">bear-proof</a> receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued to come up with innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with <a href="rubber%20bullet">rubber bullet</a>s. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and <a href="ear%20tag">ear-tagged</a> and their <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.

Despite the richness of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>, <a href="California%20condor">California condor</a>, and <a href="least%20Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a> have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, <a href="exotic%20species">exotic species</a>, air pollution, <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a>, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as <a href="road%20kill">road kill</a>s and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.
Yosemite National Park has documented more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Euro-American</a> settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in the fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as <a href="Centaurea%20solstitialis">yellow star thistle</a> ("Centaurea solstitialis"), are able to produce a long <a href="tap%20root">tap root</a> that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.

Bull thistle ("<a href="Cirsium%20vulgare">Cirsium vulgare</a>"), common mullein ("<a href="Verbascum%20thapsus">Verbascum thapsus</a>"), and Klamath weed ("<a href="Hypericum%20perforatum">Hypericum perforatum</a>") have been identified as noxious <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a> in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle ("Centaurea solstitialis"), sweet clover ("<a href="Melilot">Melilot</a>" spp.), Himalayan blackberry ("<a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Rubus armeniacus</a>"), cut-leaved blackberry ("<a href="Rubus%20laciniatus">Rubus laciniatus</a>") and large periwinkle ("<a href="Vinca%20major">Vinca major</a>").

Increasing <a href="ozone">ozone</a> pollution is causing tissue damage to the massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the <a href="conifer%20cone">cones</a> of these trees require fire-touched soil to <a href="germination">germinate</a>, historic <a href="Wildfire%23Suppression">fire suppression</a> has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting <a href="prescribed%20fire">prescribed fire</a>s is expected to help the germination issue.

Forest fires seasonally clear the park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism. The <a href="Rim%20Fire">Rim Fire</a> in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.

During late July and early August, 2018, sections of the park, including the Valley, were temporarily closed due to the Ferguson Fire at its western boundary. The closing was the largest in almost thirty years at the park.

Yosemite Valley is open year-round and numerous activities are available through the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, Yosemite Conservancy, and <a href="Aramark">Aramark</a> at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see views of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic <a href="Tioga%20Road">Tioga Road</a> to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) and go for a walk or hike.

Most park visitors stay just for the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley is a serious problem during peak season, in summer. A free <a href="public%20transport">shuttle bus system</a> operates year-round in the valley, and <a href="park%20ranger">park ranger</a>s encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.

In addition to exploring the natural features of the park, visitors can also learn about the natural and cultural history of Yosemite Valley at a number of facilities in the valley: the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. There are also two <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>s: the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>'s <a href="LeConte%20Memorial%20Lodge">LeConte Memorial Lodge</a> (Yosemite's first public visitor center), and the Ahwahnee Hotel. Camp 4 was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2003.

In the winter, it is snowed in, but the area of <a href="Tuolumne%20Meadows">Tuolumne Meadows</a> has a great deal of <a href="Hiking%2C%20rock%20climbing%2C%20and%20mountain%20climbing%20around%20Tuolumne%20Meadows">hiking, rock climbing, and mountain climbing</a>.

Over of trails are available to hikers—everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or an overnight <a href="backpacking%20%28wilderness%29">backpack trip</a>. One of the most popular trails leads to the summit of <a href="Half%20Dome">Half Dome</a> and requires an advance permit from <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> weekend in late May, to <a href="Columbus%20Day">Columbus Day</a> in early October. A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.

The park can be divided into five sections for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and <a href="Crane%20Flat%20Campground">Crane Flat</a>/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the National Park Service in Yosemite. Park rangers encourage visitors to experience portions of the park in addition to Yosemite Valley.

Between late spring and early fall, much of the park can be accessed for multiple-day backpacking trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.

While some locations in Yosemite require hiking, other locations can be reached via automobile transportation. Driving locations also allow guests to observe the night sky in locations other than their campsite or lodge. All of the roads in Yosemite are scenic, but the most famous is the Tioga Road, typically open from late May or early June through November.

As an alternative to driving, bicycles are allowed on the roads. However, bicycles are allowed off-road on only of paved trails in Yosemite Valley itself; mountain biking is not allowed.

Rock climbing is an important part of Yosemite. <a href="Camp%204%20%28Yosemite%29">Camp 4</a>, a walk-in campground in Yosemite Valley, was instrumental in the development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Climbers can generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high (3 m) boulders to the face of El Capitan. Classes on rock climbing are offered by numerous groups.

Yosemite Valley is open all year, although some roads within the park close in winter. <a href="Downhill%20skiing">Downhill skiing</a> is available at the <a href="Badger%20Pass%20Ski%20Area">Badger Pass Ski Area</a>—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, offering downhill skiing from mid-December through early April. Much of the park is open to <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a> and <a href="snowshoe">snowshoe</a>ing, with several backcountry ski huts open for use. Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.

The <a href="Ahwahnee%20Hotel">Bracebridge dinner</a> is an annual holiday event, held since 1927 at the Ahwahnee Hotel, inspired by <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>'s descriptions of Squire Bracebridge and English <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> traditions of the 18th century in his "Sketch Book". Between 1929 and 1973, the show was organized by <a href="Ansel%20Adams">Ansel Adams</a>.

Bicycle rentals are available in Yosemite Valley spring through fall. Over of paved bike paths are available in Yosemite Valley. In addition, bicyclists can ride on regular roads. Helmets are required by law for children under 18 years of age. Off-trail riding and <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a> are not permitted in Yosemite National Park.

Water activities are plentiful during warmer months. Rafting can be done through the Yosemite Valley on the Merced River. There are also swimming pools available at Yosemite Lodge and Curry Village.
In 2010, Yosemite National Park was honored with its own quarter under the <a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20Quarters">America the Beautiful Quarters</a> program.

The opening scenes of "" (1989) were filmed in Yosemite National Park. Films such as "<a href="The%20Last%20of%20the%20Mohicans%20%281920%20American%20film%29">The Last of the Mohicans</a>" (1920) and "<a href="Maverick%20%28film%29">Maverick</a>" (1994) have also been shot here.

Alexandra of Denmark

Alexandra of Denmark (Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia; 1 December 1844 – 20 November 1925) was <a href="List%20of%20British%20royal%20consorts">Queen of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="British%20Dominions">British Dominions</a> and <a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a> as the wife of <a href="King%20Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a>.

Her family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a>, was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his distant cousin, <a href="Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick VII</a>, to the Danish throne. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed to the vacant Greek throne as <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I</a>. She was <a href="Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess of Wales</a> from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.

On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became <a href="king-emperor">king-emperor</a> as Edward VII, with Alexandra as queen-empress. She held the status until Edward's death in 1910. She greatly distrusted her nephew, German Emperor <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a>, and supported her son <a href="George%20V">George V</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, in which Britain and its allies fought Germany.

Princess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia, or "Alix", as her immediate family knew her, was born at the <a href="Yellow%20Palace%2C%20Copenhagen">Yellow Palace</a>, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, right next to the <a href="Amalienborg%20Palace">Amalienborg Palace</a> complex in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. Her father was <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg</a> and her mother was Princess <a href="Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Louise of Hesse-Kassel</a>. Although she was of royal blood, her family lived a comparatively normal life. They did not possess great wealth; her father's income from an army commission was about <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>800 per year and their house was a rent-free <a href="grace%20and%20favour">grace and favour</a> property. Occasionally, <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.

In 1848, King <a href="Christian%20VIII%20of%20Denmark">Christian VIII of Denmark</a> died and his only son <a href="Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark">Frederick</a> ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, had been through two unsuccessful marriages, and was assumed to be infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> and <a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the <a href="Salic%20law">Salic law</a> prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. In 1852, the major European powers called a <a href="London%20Protocol%20%281852%29">conference in London</a> to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own <a href="Princess%20Louise%20Charlotte%20of%20Denmark">mother-in-law</a>, <a href="Frederick%20William%20of%20Hesse">brother-in-law</a> and wife) were surrendered.

Prince Christian was given the title Prince of Denmark and his family moved into a new official residence, <a href="Bernstorff%20Palace">Bernstorff Palace</a>. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, <a href="Louise%20Rasmussen">Louise Rasmussen</a>, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dagmar</a> (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, <a href="Nancy%20Edberg">Nancy Edberg</a>. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was <a href="Confirmation">confirmed</a> in <a href="Christiansborg%20Palace">Christiansborg Palace</a>. She was devout throughout her life, and followed <a href="High%20Church">High Church</a> practice.

<a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and her husband, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, were already concerned with finding a bride for their son and heir, Albert Edward, the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. They enlisted the aid of their daughter, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia</a>, in seeking a suitable candidate. Alexandra was not their first choice, since the Danes were at loggerheads with the Prussians over the <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Question">Schleswig-Holstein Question</a> and most of the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a>'s relations were German. Eventually, after rejecting other possibilities, they settled on her as "the only one to be chosen".

On 24 September 1861, Crown Princess Victoria introduced her brother Albert Edward to Alexandra at <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>. Almost a year later on 9 September 1862 (after his affair with <a href="Nellie%20Clifden">Nellie Clifden</a> and the death of his father) Albert Edward proposed to Alexandra at the <a href="Royal%20Castle%20of%20Laeken">Royal Castle of Laeken</a>, the home of his great-uncle, King <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold I of Belgium</a>.

A few months later, Alexandra travelled from Denmark to Britain aboard the royal yacht <a href="HMY%20Victoria%20and%20Albert%20II">"Victoria and Albert II"</a> and arrived in <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend, Kent</a>, on 7 March 1863. Sir <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> composed music for her arrival and <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a> <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, wrote an ode in Alexandra's honour:

<a href="Charles%20Longley">Thomas Longley</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, married the couple on 10 March 1863 at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the ceremony took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve. As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, including <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a>.

By the end of the following year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">her brother George</a> had become <a href="List%20of%20kings%20of%20Greece">King of the Hellenes</a>, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">her sister Dagmar</a> was engaged to the <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Nicholas%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Tsesarevich of Russia</a>, and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to <a href="Second%20War%20of%20Schleswig">further conflict over the fate of Schleswig-Holstein</a>. The <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her for the rest of her life.

Alexandra's first child, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Albert Victor</a>, was born two months premature in early 1864. Alexandra showed devotion to her children: "She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds." Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, <a href="George%20V">George</a>, <a href="Princess%20Louise%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Duchess%20of%20Fife">Louise</a>, <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20Alexandra%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Victoria</a>, <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Maud</a>, and <a href="Prince%20Alexander%20John%20of%20Wales">John</a>. All of Alexandra's children were apparently born prematurely; biographer <a href="Richard%20Hough">Richard Hough</a> thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as she did not want the queen to be present at their births. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a> threatened Alexandra's life, and left her with a permanent limp.

In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed many social activities, including dancing and ice-skating, and was an expert horsewoman and <a href="Combined%20driving">tandem driver</a>. She also enjoyed <a href="Hunting%20and%20shooting%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">hunting</a>, to the dismay of Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.

Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After her illness the previous year, she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child. The royal couple undertook a six-month tour taking in <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>, <a href="Khedivate%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a> over 1868 and 1869, which included visits to her brother King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a>, to the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean</a> battlefields and, for her only, to the harem of the <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Khedive Ismail</a>. In <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkey</a> she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (<a href="Abd%C3%BCl%C3%A2ziz">Abdülâziz</a>).

The Waleses made <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> their preferred residence, with <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, the disease which was believed to have killed his father, in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress <a href="Lillie%20Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a>, <a href="Daisy%20Greville%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick</a>, humanitarian <a href="Agnes%20Keyser">Agnes Keyser</a>, and society matron <a href="Alice%20Keppel">Alice Keppel</a>. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit her husband as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.

An increasing degree of deafness, caused by hereditary <a href="otosclerosis">otosclerosis</a>, led to Alexandra's social isolation; she spent more time at home with her children and pets. Her sixth and final pregnancy ended tragically when her infant son died only a day after his birth. Despite Alexandra's pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as "a wretched abortion" and the funeral arrangements as "sickening mummery", even though the infant was not buried in state with other members of the royal family at Windsor, but in strict privacy in the churchyard at Sandringham, where he had lived out his brief life.

For eight months over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, <a href="Earl%20of%20Aylesford">Lord Aylesford</a>, was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man: <a href="George%20Spencer-Churchill%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Lord Blandford</a>, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a>, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of <a href="William%20Knollys%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Sir William Knollys</a> and <a href="Princess%20Mary%20Adelaide%20of%20Cambridge">the Duchess of Teck</a>, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.

Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29">Russo-Turkish War</a>, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent the next three years largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> after the assassination of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the <a href="tsarina">tsarina</a>.

Alexandra undertook many public duties; in the words of Queen Victoria, "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place ... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty." She took a particular interest in the <a href="London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a>, visiting it regularly. <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a>, the so-called "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the <a href="City%20of%20Cork">City of Cork</a>, a hotbed of <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalism</a>. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as "enthusiastic". As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a>.

The death of her eldest son, <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, in 1892 was a serious blow to Alexandra. His room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> were left after his death in 1861. She said, "I have buried my angel and with him my happiness." Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted. In 1894, her brother-in-law <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a> died and her nephew <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> became <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>. Alexandra's widowed sister, <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">the Dowager Empress</a>, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed, and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander's burial.

With the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress consort to the new king. Just two months later, her son <a href="George%20V">George</a> and daughter-in-law <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary</a> left on an extensive tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George's return, preparations for <a href="Coronation%20of%20King%20Edward%20VII%20and%20Queen%20Alexandra">Edward and Alexandra's coronation</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> were well in hand but just a few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Royal Ascot races</a> without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by <a href="Sir%20Frederick%20Treves%2C%201st%20Baronet">Frederick Treves</a> of the <a href="London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a> to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Temple">Frederick Temple</a>, and she by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, <a href="William%20Dalrymple%20Maclagan">William Dalrymple Maclagan</a>.

Despite being queen, Alexandra's duties changed little, and she kept many of the same retainers. Alexandra's <a href="Woman%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">Woman of the Bedchamber</a>, <a href="Charlotte%20Knollys">Charlotte Knollys</a>, the daughter of Sir William Knollys, served Alexandra loyally for many years. On 10 December 1903, Knollys woke to find her bedroom full of smoke. She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety. In the words of <a href="Princess%20Augusta%20of%20Cambridge">Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>, "We must give credit to old Charlotte for "really" saving [Alexandra's] life."

Alexandra again looked after her grandchildren when George and Mary went on a second tour, this time to <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, over the winter of 1905–06. Her father, King Christian IX of Denmark, died that January. Eager to retain their family links, both to each other and to Denmark, in 1907 Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, purchased a villa north of Copenhagen, <a href="Hvid%C3%B8re%20%28building%29">Hvidøre</a>, as a private getaway.

Alexandra was denied access to the king's briefing papers and excluded from some of his foreign tours to prevent her meddling in diplomatic matters. She was deeply distrustful of Germans, and invariably opposed anything that favoured German expansion or interests. For example, in 1890 Alexandra wrote a memorandum, distributed to senior British ministers and military personnel, warning against the planned exchange of the British <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> island of <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> for the German colony of <a href="Zanzibar">Zanzibar</a>, pointing out Heligoland's strategic significance and that it could be used either by Germany to launch an attack, or by Britain to contain German aggression. Despite this, <a href="Heligoland%E2%80%93Zanzibar%20Treaty">the exchange</a> went ahead anyway. The Germans fortified the island and, in the words of <a href="Robert%20Ensor">Robert Ensor</a> and as Alexandra had predicted, it "became the keystone of Germany's maritime position for offence as well as for defence". The "<a href="Frankfurter%20Zeitung">Frankfurter Zeitung</a>" was outspoken in its condemnation of Alexandra and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia, saying that the pair were "the centre of the international anti-German conspiracy". She despised and distrusted her nephew, <a href="German%20Emperor%20Wilhelm%20II">German Emperor Wilhelm II</a>, calling him in 1900 "inwardly our enemy".

In 1910, Alexandra became the first queen consort to visit the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">British House of Commons</a> during a debate. In a remarkable departure from precedent, for two hours she sat in the Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the <a href="Parliament%20Act%201911">Parliament Bill</a>, to remove the right of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterwards, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told <a href="Frederick%20Ponsonby%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sysonby">Frederick Ponsonby</a>, "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." Later that year she moved out of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a>, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>'s request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.

From Edward's death, Alexandra was <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a>, being a <a href="dowager">dowager</a> queen and the mother of the reigning monarch. She did not attend her son's coronation in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause included <a href="Alexandra%20Rose%20Day">Alexandra Rose Day</a>, where artificial roses made by people with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers. During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, in <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to "have down those hateful German banners". Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the king had the banners removed but to Alexandra's dismay he had down not only "those vile Prussian banners" but also those of her Hessian relations who were, in her opinion, "simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders". On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> air raid, but far worse was to befall other members of her family. In Russia, her nephew <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas II</a> was overthrown and he, his wife and their children were killed by revolutionaries. Her sister the Dowager Empress was rescued from Russia in 1919 by and brought to England, where she lived for some time with Alexandra.

Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years, but during the war her age caught up with her. She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face "enamelled". She made no more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill health. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness. Towards the end of her life, her memory and speech became impaired. She died on 20 November 1925 at <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham</a> after suffering a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a>, and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.

The <a href="Queen%20Alexandra%20Memorial">Queen Alexandra Memorial</a> by <a href="Alfred%20Gilbert">Alfred Gilbert</a> was unveiled on <a href="Alexandra%20Rose%20Day">Alexandra Rose Day</a> 8 June 1932 at Marlborough Gate, London. An ode in her memory, <a href="Queen%20Alexandra%27s%20Memorial%20Ode">"So many true princesses who have gone"</a>, composed by the then <a href="Master%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Musick">Master of the King's Musick</a> Sir <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a> to words by the <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a> <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>, was sung at the unveiling and conducted by the composer.

Alexandra was highly popular with the British public. After she married the Prince of Wales in 1863, a new park and "People's Palace", a public exhibition and arts centre under construction in north London, were renamed the <a href="Alexandra%20Palace">Alexandra Palace</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20Park%2C%20London">park</a> to commemorate her. There are at least sixty-seven roads and streets in the <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a> area alone called Alexandra Road, Alexandra Avenue, Alexandra Gardens, Alexandra Close or Alexandra Street, all named after her. Unlike her husband and mother-in-law, she was not castigated by the press. Funds that she helped to collect were used to buy a river launch, called "Alexandra", to ferry the wounded during the <a href="Mahdist%20War">Sudan campaign</a>, and to fit out a hospital ship, named "The Princess of Wales", to bring back wounded from the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. During the Boer War, Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, later renamed <a href="Queen%20Alexandra%27s%20Royal%20Army%20Nursing%20Corps">Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps</a>, was founded under Royal Warrant.

Alexandra had little understanding of money. The management of her finances was left in the hands of her loyal <a href="comptroller">comptroller</a>, Sir <a href="Dighton%20Probyn">Dighton Probyn</a> <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, who undertook a similar role for her husband. In the words of her grandson, <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> (later the Duke of Windsor), "Her generosity was a source of embarrassment to her financial advisers. Whenever she received a letter soliciting money, a cheque would be sent by the next post, regardless of the authenticity of the mendicant and without having the case investigated." Though she was not always extravagant (she had her old stockings darned for re-use and her old dresses were recycled as furniture covers), she would dismiss protests about her heavy spending with a wave of a hand or by claiming that she had not heard.

She hid a small scar on her neck, which was probably the result of a childhood operation, by wearing <a href="choker">choker</a> necklaces and high necklines, setting fashions which were adopted for fifty years. Alexandra's effect on fashion was so profound that society ladies even copied her limping gait, after her serious illness in 1867 left her with a stiff leg. This came to be known as the "Alexandra limp". She used predominantly the London fashion houses; her favourite was <a href="Redfern%20%28couture%29">Redfern's</a>, but she shopped occasionally at <a href="Jacques%20Doucet%20%28fashion%20designer%29">Doucet</a> and Fromont of Paris.

Queen Alexandra has been portrayed on television by <a href="Deborah%20Grant%20%28actress%29">Deborah Grant</a> and <a href="Helen%20Ryan">Helen Ryan</a> in "<a href="Edward%20the%20Seventh">Edward the Seventh</a>", <a href="Ann%20Firbank">Ann Firbank</a> in "<a href="Lillie%20%28TV%20series%29">Lillie</a>", <a href="Maggie%20Smith">Maggie Smith</a> in "<a href="All%20the%20King%27s%20Men%20%281999%20film%29">All the King's Men</a>", and <a href="Bibi%20Andersson">Bibi Andersson</a> in "<a href="The%20Lost%20Prince">The Lost Prince</a>". She was portrayed in film by Helen Ryan again in the 1980 film "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>", <a href="Sara%20Stewart">Sara Stewart</a> in the 1997 film "<a href="Mrs%20Brown">Mrs Brown</a>", and <a href="Julia%20Blake">Julia Blake</a> in the 1999 film "<a href="Passion%20%281999%20film%29">Passion</a>". In a 1980 stage play by <a href="Royce%20Ryton">Royce Ryton</a>, "Motherdear", she was portrayed by <a href="Margaret%20Lockwood">Margaret Lockwood</a> in her last acting role.


In 1901, she became the first woman since 1488 to be made a <a href="List%20of%20Ladies%20of%20the%20Garter">Lady of the Garter</a>. Other honours she held included Member First Class of the <a href="Royal%20Order%20of%20Victoria%20and%20Albert">Royal Order of Victoria and Albert</a>, Lady of the Imperial <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20India">Order of the Crown of India</a>, and Lady of Justice of the <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a>. On 1 January 1918, she was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a>.

Among foreign honours received by Queen Alexandra was the Japanese <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Precious%20Crown">Order of the Precious Crown</a>, delivered to her on behalf of <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> by <a href="Prince%20Komatsu%20Akihito">Prince Komatsu Akihito</a> when he visited the United Kingdom in June 1902 to attend the coronation. At the same time she also received the Order of Nishan-i-Sadakat from the <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Sultan of the Ottoman Empire</a>, despatched to London by a special messenger together with their coronation representatives.

Queen Alexandra's arms upon the <a href="Accession%20Day">accession</a> of her husband in 1901 were the <a href="royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom</a> impaled with the arms of her father, the King of Denmark. The shield is surmounted by the imperial crown, and supported by the crowned lion of England and a wild man or savage from the <a href="Danish%20royal%20arms">Danish royal arms</a>.

Camille Saint-Saëns

Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (; 9 October 183516 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic era</a>. His best-known works include <a href="Introduction%20and%20Rondo%20Capriccioso">Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso</a> (1863), the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Second Piano Concerto</a> (1868), the <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">First Cello Concerto</a> (1872), "<a href="Danse%20macabre%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Danse macabre</a>" (1874), the opera "<a href="Samson%20and%20Delilah%20%28opera%29">Samson and Delilah</a>" (1877), the <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Third Violin Concerto</a> (1880), the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Third ("Organ") Symphony</a> (1886) and "<a href="The%20Carnival%20of%20the%20Animals">The Carnival of the Animals</a>" (1886).

Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the <a href="Paris%20Conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</a> he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at <a href="Saint-Merri">Saint-Merri</a>, Paris and, from 1858, <a href="La%20Madeleine%2C%20Paris">La Madeleine</a>, the official church of the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a>. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas.

As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the <a href="Impressionism%20in%20music">impressionist</a> and <a href="dodecaphonic">dodecaphonic</a> schools of music; although there were <a href="Neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neoclassical</a> elements in his music, foreshadowing works by <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a>, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death.

Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>, among whose own later pupils was <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius.

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, "née" Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of <a href="Normandy">Norman</a> ancestry, and his wife was from an <a href="Haute-Marne">Haute-Marne</a> family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the <a href="6th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">6th arrondissement</a> of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of <a href="Church%20of%20Saint-Sulpice%2C%20Paris">Saint-Sulpice</a>, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of <a href="Consumption%20%28disease%29">consumption</a> on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at <a href="Corbeil-Essonnes">Corbeil</a>, to the south of Paris.
When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed <a href="perfect%20pitch">perfect pitch</a> and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of <a href="Camille-Marie%20Stamaty">Camille-Marie Stamaty</a>, a former pupil of <a href="Friedrich%20Kalkbrenner">Friedrich Kalkbrenner</a>. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, "It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart." The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the <a href="Salle%20Pleyel">Salle Pleyel</a>, in a programme that included <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2015%20%28Mozart%29">Piano Concerto in B</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6chel-Verzeichnis">K</a>450), and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Third Piano Concerto</a>. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher <a href="Alexandre%20Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bo%C3%ABly">Alexandre Pierre François Boëly</a>. From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, which was then little known in France.

As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects. In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics. His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life.
In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the <a href="Paris%20Conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</a>, France's foremost music academy. The director, <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Daniel Auber</a>, had succeeded <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Luigi Cherubini</a> in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Benoist">François Benoist</a>, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included <a href="Adolphe%20Adam">Adolphe Adam</a>, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>, <a href="Charles%20Alkan">Charles Alkan</a>, <a href="Louis%20James%20Alfred%20Lef%C3%A9bure-W%C3%A9ly">Louis Lefébure-Wély</a> and <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Georges Bizet</a>. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>, whose pupils included <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a> and Bizet.

Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, "Les Djinns" (1850), after an <a href="Les%20Djinns%20%28poem%29">eponymous poem</a> by <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. He competed for France's premier musical award, the <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, <a href="L%C3%A9once%20Cohen">Léonce Cohen</a>, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his "Ode à Sainte-Cécile", for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an <a href="opus%20number">opus number</a> was "Trois Morceaux" for <a href="harmonium">harmonium</a> (1852).

On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of <a href="Saint-Merri">Saint-Merri</a> near the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Ville%2C%20Paris">Hôtel de Ville</a>. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Henri%20Clicquot">François-Henri Clicquot</a>, had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> and the restoration of the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a>. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.

Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>, <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, and the influential singer <a href="Pauline%20Viardot">Pauline Viardot</a>, who all encouraged him in his career. In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of <a href="La%20Madeleine%2C%20Paris">La Madeleine</a>, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.

Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions. He commented, "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion."

In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which <a href="Louis%20Niedermeyer">Louis Niedermeyer</a> had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>, recalled in old age:

Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>). He conceived his best-known piece, "<a href="The%20Carnival%20of%20the%20Animals">The Carnival of the Animals</a>", with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.

In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:

According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known "bon mot" about Saint-Saëns, "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience" ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience"). The winner, <a href="Victor%20Sieg">Victor Sieg</a>, had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency". The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does." The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul". The critic and composer <a href="Jeremy%20Nicholas%20%28writer%29">Jeremy Nicholas</a> observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as "Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius", and "Bad music well written".
While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata "Les noces de Prométhée" beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Second Piano Concerto</a>. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.

In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and <a href="Romain%20Bussine">Romain Bussine</a>, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the <a href="National%20Guard%20%28France%29">National Guard</a> during the war. During the brief but bloody <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of <a href="George%20Grove">George Grove</a> and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a>, with its motto, ""Ars Gallica"", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and <a href="Henri%20Duparc%20%28composer%29">Henri Duparc</a>, Fauré, Franck and <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Jules Massenet</a> among its founder-members.
As an admirer of Liszt's innovative <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a>s, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first "poème symphonique" was "<a href="Le%20Rouet%20d%27Omphale">Le Rouet d'Omphale</a>" (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. "<a href="La%20princesse%20jaune">La princesse jaune</a>" ("The Yellow Princess"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.

Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the <a href="Rue%20du%20Faubourg%20Saint-Honor%C3%A9">Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré</a> with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, "Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with". Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the <a href="Rue%20Monsieur-le-Prince">Rue Monsieur-le-Prince</a>, in the <a href="Latin%20Quarter">Latin Quarter</a>; his mother moved with them. The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months. Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage.
For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful "La princesse jaune" staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act "drame lyricque", "<a href="Le%20timbre%20d%27argent">Le timbre d'argent</a>" ("The Silver Bell"), to <a href="Jules%20Barbier">Jules Barbier</a>'s and <a href="Michel%20Carr%C3%A9">Michel Carré</a>'s libretto, reminiscent of the <a href="Faust">Faust</a> legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Lyrique">Théâtre Lyrique</a> company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.

The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy "To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a "<a href="Requiem%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Messe de Requiem</a>" in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; <a href="Charles-Marie%20Widor">Charles-Marie Widor</a> played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted.

In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with "<a href="Samson%20et%20Dalila">Samson et Dalila</a>", his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the <a href="Paris%20Op%C3%A9ra">Paris Opéra</a> until 1892.

Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries. His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt.

Saint-Saëns was elected to the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a> in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the <a href="Auvergne">Auvergnat</a> spa town of <a href="La%20Bourboule">La Bourboule</a> for a holiday. On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, "For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here."
In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera. He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being "<a href="Henry%20VIII%20%28opera%29">Henry VIII</a>" (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra. Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England. The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime. When it was produced at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> in 1898, "<a href="The%20Era%20%28newspaper%29">The Era</a>" commented that though French librettists generally "make a pretty hash of British history", this piece was "not altogether contemptible as an opera story".

The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>. They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its ""Ars Gallica"" ethos of commitment to French works. Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886. Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers. His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music.

By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer. In 1886 the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society</a> of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Third ("Organ") Symphony</a>. It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">Fourth Piano Concerto</a>, conducted by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sir Arthur Sullivan</a>. The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year. Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's "drame lyrique" "Proserpine" opened at the Opéra-Comique. It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost.

In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died. He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide. He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.

During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893. He wrote one opera, the comedy "Phryné" (1893), and together with <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Paul Dukas</a> helped to complete "Frédégonde" (1895) an opera left unfinished by <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a>, who died in 1892. "Phryné" was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>. His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement <a href="fantasia%20%28music%29">fantasia</a> "Africa" (1891) and his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%205%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Fifth ("Egyptian") Piano Concerto</a>, which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846. Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support.

Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> in June 1893, when he, <a href="Max%20Bruch">Bruch</a> and <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> performed at an event presented by <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> for the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Musical%20Society">Cambridge University Musical Society</a>, marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors. Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: "The demands of English religion are not excessive. The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers". His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "The Promised Land", was composed for the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> of 1913.

In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This remained his home for the rest of his life. He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist. He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France. In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the US, as a pianist and conductor. In New York on his second visit he premiered his "Praise ye the Lord" for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion.

Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Mahler%29">Eighth Symphony</a> in 1910. Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music. Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>" (1913), of which he was the dedicatee. In 1917 <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Francis Poulenc</a>, at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius. By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common. His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy. Nor did the theories of <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schönberg</a>'s <a href="dodecaphony">dodecaphony</a> commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:

Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of <a href="Vaslav%20Nijinsky">Vaslav Nijinsky</a> and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s ballet "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.

When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher. They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's "<a href="En%20blanc%20et%20noir">En blanc et noir</a>" (1915): "We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the <a href="cubist">cubist</a> pictures." His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters. Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a> was equally uncompromising: of <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a>'s <a href="polytonal">polytonal</a> symphonic suite "Protée" (1919) he commented, "fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France".
Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities. These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships.

In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the <a href="Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse">Cimetière de Montparnasse</a>. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.

In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>" wrote:

Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic DCParker wrote, "That Saint-Saëns knows <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a>... <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, <a href="Josef%20Haydn">Haydn</a> and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art."

Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, "supple and pliable", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the "phrase pattern AABB is characteristic". An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. "Grove" observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although "Grove" points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.

The authors of the 1955 "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>", <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West%2C%205th%20Baron%20Sackville">Edward Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Shawe-Taylor%20%28music%20critic%29">Desmond Shawe-Taylor</a> write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was "instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that that there are other forms of music besides opera." In the 2001 edition of "Grove's Dictionary", Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The "Urbs Roma" Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and "thick and heavy" in its effect. Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of <a href="fugue">fugal</a> writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring "motif" treated in a Lisztian style of <a href="thematic%20transformation">thematic transformation</a>.
Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the "vulgar blatancy" to which the earlier composer was prone. The most popular of the four is "<a href="Danse%20macabre%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Danse macabre</a>" (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a> prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers. "<a href="Le%20Rouet%20d%27Omphale">Le Rouet d'Omphale</a>" (1870) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies. Rees rates "Phaëton" (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the <a href="Phaethon">mythical hero</a> and his fate. A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece "the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre" rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece. The last of the four symphonic poems, "La jeunesse d'Hercule" ("Hercules's Youth", 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful. In the judgment of the critic <a href="Roger%20Nichols%20%28musical%20scholar%29">Roger Nichols</a> these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration "set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel".

Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, "Javot" (1896), the score for the film "<a href="The%20Assassination%20of%20the%20Duke%20of%20Guise">L'assassinat du duc de Guise</a>" (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a> and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and <a href="Marc-Antoine%20Charpentier">Charpentier</a>.

Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos. His <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">First</a>, in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Second</a>, in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a>. The <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> second movement and "<a href="Tempo%20markings">presto</a>" finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist <a href="Zygmunt%20Stojowski">Zygmunt Stojowski</a> commented that the work "begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach". The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Third Piano Concerto</a>, in E (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines. The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%204%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Fourth</a>, in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns "the Beethoven of France" (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the "Egyptian" concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in <a href="Luxor">Luxor</a>, and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.

The <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">First Cello Concerto</a>, in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by <a href="Pablo%20Casals">Pablo Casals</a> and later players. The <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Second</a>, in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Second</a>, in C major. The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour. The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime. The <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%203%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Third</a>, in B minor, written for <a href="Pablo%20de%20Sarasate">Pablo de Sarasate</a>, is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity. It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the <a href="Introduction%20and%20Rondo%20Capriccioso">Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso</a>, in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, "After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major".

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished "Frédégonde", Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are "<a href="Op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéras comiques</a>". During the composer's lifetime his "<a href="Henry%20VIII%20%28opera%29">Henry VIII</a>" became a repertory piece; since his death only "Samson et Dalila" has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, "<a href="Ascanio">Ascanio</a>" (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic <a href="Ronald%20Crichton">Ronald Crichton</a> writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns "lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: "Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics". Saint-Saëns's biographer <a href="James%20Harding%20%28music%20writer%29">James Harding</a> comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of "La princesse jaune", which Harding describes as like Sullivan "with a light French touch".

Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as "a bridge between <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a> and the serious French operas of the early 1890s". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – "lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable." Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for "Henry VIII" he included <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a> music he had researched in London; in "La princesse jaune" he used an oriental <a href="pentatonic">pentatonic</a> scale; from Wagner he derived the use of <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as <a href="Through-composed%23Opera%20and%20musicals">through composition</a> is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers. In a survey of recorded opera <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a> writes that Saint-Saëns "certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>", and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style."

From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>s", writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> or other German composers of "<a href="Lieder">Lieder</a>". Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – "Mélodies persanes" ("Persian Songs", 1870) and "Le Cendre rouge" ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>; others included <a href="Alphonse%20de%20Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Pierre Corneille</a>, <a href="Amable%20Tastu">Amable Tastu</a>, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer <a href="Lili%20Boulanger">Lili Boulanger</a> that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable." Most of the "mélodies" are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and "Hymne à la paix" ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>.

Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from <a href="motet">motet</a>s to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios "Le déluge" (1875) and "The Promised Land" (1913) with an English text by <a href="Herman%20Klein">Herman Klein</a>. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, "One likes to be appreciated in the home, "par excellence", of oratorio." He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a> and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.

Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, "this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark". Nichols excepts the "Étude en forme de valse" (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique. Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed "the French Beethoven", and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one. There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as "Souvenir d'Italie" (1887), "Les cloches du soir" ("Evening bells", 1889) and "Souvenir d'Ismaïlia" (1895).
Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo. Some of them were written for use in church services – "Offertoire" (1853), "Bénédiction nuptiale" (1859), "Communion" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former.

Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other "cantabile". The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of <a href="Baroque%20music">baroque</a> composers including <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a>.

In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by "Grove's Dictionary" as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.
The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works. Ratner writes of them, "The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement." Gallois comments that the <a href="Oboe%20Sonata%20%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Oboe Sonata</a> begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of <a href="tarantella">tarantella</a>. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it "a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism" amounting to "a summary of the rest". The work contrasts a "doleful <a href="threnody">threnody</a>" in the slow movement with the finale, which "pirouettes in 4/4 time", in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata "a model of transparency, vitality and lightness", containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation.

The composer's most famous work, "The Carnival of the Animals" (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by "Grove's Dictionary" to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output. "Grove" rates it as "his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own "Danse macabre" and several popular tunes". He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer.

Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music. In June 1904 <a href="The%20Gramophone%20Company">The Gramophone Company</a> of London sent its producer <a href="Fred%20Gaisberg">Fred Gaisberg</a> to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> Meyriane Héglon in arias from "Ascanio" and "Samson et Dalila", and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919.

In the early days of the <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a>, Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc. "The Record Guide" (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of "Danse Macabre", "The Carnival of the Animals", the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works. In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Recorded%20Classical%20Music">Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music</a>" contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs. A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's "mélodies" was released in 1997.

With the exception of "Samson et Dalila" the operas have been sparsely represented on disc. A recording of "Henry VIII" was issued on CD and DVD in 1992. "<a href="H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20%28opera%29">Hélène</a>" was released on CD in 2008. There are several recordings of "Samson et Dalilah", under conductors including <a href="Colin%20Davis">Sir Colin Davis</a>, <a href="Georges%20Pr%C3%AAtre">Georges Prêtre</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Barenboim">Daniel Barenboim</a> and <a href="Myung-Whun%20Chung">Myung-Whun Chung</a>.

Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913. Foreign honours included the British <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Royal Victorian Order</a> (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> (1893) and <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> (1907).

In its obituary notice, "The Times" commented:
In a short poem, "Mea culpa", published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him. An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, "His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day." The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic <a href="H.%20C.%20Colles">Henry Colles</a>, wrote, a few days after the composer's death:
"Grove" concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, "it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style. Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors".

Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as "The Carnival of the Animals", the Second Piano Concerto, the Organ Symphony, "Samson et Dalila", "Danse macabre" and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the <a href="Oratorio%20de%20No%C3%ABl">Christmas Oratorio</a>, the ballet "Javotte", the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist <a href="Steven%20Isserlis">Steven Isserlis</a> said, "Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting. I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece. His works are rewarding in every way. And he's an endlessly fascinating figure."

Empress Matilda

Empress Matilda (<a href="Circa">c.</a> 7 February 110210 September 1167), also known as the Empress Maude, was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>. The daughter of <a href="King%20Henry%20I%20of%20England">King Henry I of England</a>, she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor%20Henry%20V">Holy Roman Emperor Henry V</a>. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in <a href="Old%20St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>, and acted as the imperial <a href="regent">regent</a> in Italy. Matilda and Henry had no children, and when Henry died in 1125, the crown was claimed by <a href="Lothair%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Lothair II</a>, one of his political enemies.

Meanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, <a href="William%20Adelin">William Adelin</a>, died in the "<a href="White%20Ship">White Ship</a>" disaster of 1120, leaving England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a> by her father, who arranged for her to marry <a href="Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey of Anjou</a> to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an <a href="oath">oath</a> of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the Norman barons and were unable to pursue their claims. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen of Blois</a>, who enjoyed the backing of the <a href="Christianity%20in%20England">English Church</a>. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.

In 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert of Gloucester</a>, and her uncle, <a href="King%20David%20I%20of%20Scotland">King David I of Scotland</a>, while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> in 1141, but the Empress's attempt to be crowned at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a> collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled the Lady of the English. Robert was captured following the <a href="Rout%20of%20Winchester">Rout of Winchester</a> in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in <a href="Oxford%20Castle">Oxford Castle</a> by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen <a href="River%20Isis">River Isis</a> at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.

Matilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> in 1154. She settled her court near <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on Henry's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket controversy</a>. She worked extensively with the Church, founding <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at <a href="Bec%20Abbey">Bec Abbey</a> after her death in 1167.

Matilda was born to <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, King of England and <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, and his first wife, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Scotland">Matilda of Scotland</a>, possibly around 7 February 1102 at <a href="Sutton%20Courtenay">Sutton Courtenay</a> in Oxfordshire. Henry was the youngest son of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. These barons typically had close links to the <a href="kingdom%20of%20France">kingdom of France</a>, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Her mother Matilda was the daughter of King <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm III of Scotland</a>, a member of the West Saxon royal family, and a descendant of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. For Henry, marrying Matilda of Scotland had given his reign increased legitimacy, and for her it had been an opportunity for high status and power in England.

Matilda had a younger, legitimate brother, <a href="William%20Adelin">William Adelin</a>, and her father's relationships with numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings. Little is known about Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, was taught to read, and was educated in religious morals. Among the nobles at her mother's court were her uncle <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, later the King of Scotland, and aspiring nobles such as her half-brother <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert of Gloucester</a>, her cousin <a href="Stephen%20of%20Blois">Stephen of Blois</a> and <a href="Brian%20Fitz%20Count">Brian Fitz Count</a>. In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother in the care of <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother. There is no detailed description of Matilda's appearance; contemporaries described Matilda as being very beautiful, but this may have simply reflected the conventional practice among the chroniclers.

In late 1108 or early 1109, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>, then the <a href="King%20of%20the%20Romans">King of the Romans</a>, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote separately to her mother on the same matter. The match was attractive to the English king: his daughter would be marrying into one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a>, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his <a href="coronation%20as%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor</a>. The final details of the deal were negotiated at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.

The couple met at <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> before travelling to <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> where, on 10 April, they became officially betrothed. On 25 July Matilda was crowned <a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Romans">Queen of the Romans</a> in a ceremony at <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>. There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24. After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of <a href="Bruno%20%28archbishop%20of%20Trier%29">Bruno</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Trier">Archbishop of Trier</a>, who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government. In January 1114 Matilda was ready to be married to Henry, and their wedding was held at the city of <a href="Worms%2C%20Germany">Worms</a> amid extravagant celebrations. Matilda now entered public life in Germany, complete with her own household.

Political conflict broke out across the Empire shortly after the marriage, triggered when Henry arrested his Chancellor <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Mainz">Adalbert</a> and various other German princes. Rebellions followed, accompanied by opposition from within the Church, which played an important part in administering the Empire, and this led to the formal excommunication of the Emperor by <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Pope Paschal II</a>. Henry and Matilda marched over the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> into Italy in early 1116, intent on settling matters permanently with the Pope. Matilda was now playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions. The rest of the year was spent establishing control of northern Italy, and in early 1117 the pair advanced on Rome itself.

Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in his absence the papal envoy <a href="Antipope%20Gregory%20VIII">Maurice Bourdin</a>, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>, probably that Easter and certainly by <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim the title of the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.

Both Bourdin's status and the ceremonies themselves were deeply ambiguous. Strictly speaking, the ceremonies were not imperial coronations but instead were formal "crown-wearing" occasions, among the few times in the year when the rulers would wear their crowns in court. Bourdin had also been <a href="excommunicated">excommunicated</a> by the time he conducted the second ceremony, and he was later to be deposed and imprisoned for life by the Pope. Nonetheless, Matilda maintained that she had been officially crowned as the empress in Rome. The titles of emperor and empress were not always consistently used in this period, and in any case her use of the title became widely accepted. Matilda chose not to dispute Anglo-Norman chroniclers who later incorrectly recorded that the Pope himself had crowned her in Rome.

In 1118, Henry returned north over the Alps into Germany to suppress fresh rebellions, leaving Matilda as his <a href="regent">regent</a> to govern Italy. There are few records of her rule over the next two years, but she probably gained considerable practical experience of government. In 1119, she returned north to meet Henry in <a href="Lotharingia">Lotharingia</a>. Her husband was occupied in finding a compromise with the Pope, who had excommunicated him. In 1122, Henry and probably Matilda were at the <a href="Concordat%20of%20Worms">Council of Worms</a>. The council settled the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire%23Investiture%20controversy">long-running dispute</a> with the Church when Henry gave up his rights to invest bishops with their episcopal regalia. Matilda attempted to visit her father in England that year, but the journey was blocked by <a href="Charles%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Charles I, Count of Flanders</a>, whose territory she would have needed to pass through. Historian <a href="Marjorie%20Chibnall">Marjorie Chibnall</a> argues Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.

Matilda and Henry remained childless, but neither party was considered to be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but by now he was suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Swabia">Frederick</a>, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but it is unclear what instructions he gave her about the future of the Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led the electoral process which appointed <a href="Lothair%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Lothair of Supplinburg</a>, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.

Now aged 23, Matilda had only limited options as to how she might spend the rest of her life. Being childless, she could not exercise a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a <a href="nun">nun</a> or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She does not appear to have expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the <a href="Hand%20of%20St%20James%20the%20Apostle">Hand of St James the Apostle</a>.

In 1120, the English political landscape had changed dramatically after the "<a href="White%20Ship">White Ship</a>" disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin and many other senior nobles – embarked one night on the "White Ship" to travel from <a href="Barfleur">Barfleur</a> in Normandy across to England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly as a result of overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.

With William dead, the succession to the English throne was thrown into doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; in some parts of France, male <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a> was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do was to identify what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons <a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a> and <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a> had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.

Initially, Henry put his hopes in fathering another son. William and Matilda's mother—Matilda of Scotland—had died in 1118, and so Henry took a new wife, <a href="Adeliza%20of%20Louvain">Adeliza of Louvain</a>. Henry and Adeliza did not conceive any children, and the future of the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered his sister <a href="Adela%20of%20Normandy">Adela</a>'s son <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen of Blois</a> as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to Matilda's wealthy maternal cousin and namesake the <a href="Matilda%20of%20Boulogne">Countess of Boulogne</a>. <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald of Blois</a>, his close ally, possibly also felt that he was in favour with Henry. <a href="William%20Clito">William Clito</a>, the only son of Robert Curthose, was King <a href="Louis%20VI%20of%20France">Louis VI of France</a>'s preferred choice, but William was in open rebellion against Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry might have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this. Henry's plans shifted when Empress Matilda's husband, Emperor Henry, died in 1125.

Matilda returned to Normandy in 1125 and spent about a year at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this failed to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.

Henry began to formally look for a new husband for Matilda in early 1127 and received various offers from princes within the Empire. His preference was to use Matilda's marriage to secure the southern borders of Normandy by marrying her to <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey of Anjou</a>, the eldest son of <a href="Fulk%2C%20King%20of%20Jerusalem">Fulk</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Anjou">Count of Anjou</a>. Henry's control of Normandy had faced numerous challenges since he had conquered it in 1106, and the latest threat came from his nephew William Clito, the new Count of Flanders, who enjoyed the support of the French King. It was essential to Henry that he did not also face a threat from the south as well as the east of Normandy. William Adelin had married Fulk's daughter <a href="Matilda%20of%20Anjou">Matilda</a>, which would have cemented an alliance between Henry and Anjou, but the "White Ship" disaster put an end to this. Henry and Fulk argued over the fate of the marriage dowry, and this had encouraged Fulk to turn to support William Clito instead. Henry's solution was now to negotiate the marriage of Matilda to Geoffrey, recreating the former alliance.

Matilda appears to have been unimpressed by this plan. She felt that marrying the son of a count diminished her imperial status and was probably also unhappy about marrying someone so much younger than she was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. <a href="Hildebert">Hildebert</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Tours">Archbishop of Tours</a>, eventually intervened to persuade her to go along with the engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over the course of the next year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> by the bishops of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20S%C3%A9ez">Séez</a>. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.

The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly like each other. There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, but it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain. Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131. Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August. It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey at a meeting of the King's great council in September. The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.

Matilda gave birth to her first son in March 1133 at Le Mans, the future <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>. Henry was delighted by the news and came to see her at Rouen. At Pentecost 1134, son <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Count%20of%20Nantes">Geoffrey</a> was born in Rouen, but the childbirth was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death. She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred <a href="Bec%20Abbey">Bec Abbey</a>, but Henry wanted her to be interred at <a href="Rouen%20Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>. Matilda recovered, and Henry was overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.

From then on, relations became increasingly strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for their claim to the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This would have given the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.

In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near <a href="Lyons-la-For%C3%AAt">Lyons-la-Forêt</a>. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.

When news began to spread of Henry I's death, Matilda and Geoffrey were in Anjou, supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Nonetheless, Geoffrey and Matilda took the opportunity to march into southern Normandy and seize a number of key castles around <a href="Argentan">Argentan</a> that had formed Matilda's disputed dowry. They then stopped, unable to advance further, pillaging the countryside and facing increased resistance from the Norman nobility and a rebellion in Anjou itself. Matilda was by now also pregnant with her third son, <a href="William%20FitzEmpress">William</a>; opinions vary among historians as to what extent this affected her military plans.

Meanwhile, news of Henry's death had reached Stephen of Blois, conveniently placed in Boulogne, and he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December and over the next week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother, <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.

Following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England, the Norman nobility had gathered at <a href="Le%20Neubourg">Le Neubourg</a> to discuss declaring his elder brother <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald</a> king. The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald's support immediately ebbed away, as the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.

Matilda gave birth to her third son William on 22 July 1136 at Argentan, and she then operated out of the border region for the next three years, establishing her household knights on estates around the area. Matilda may have asked <a href="Ulger">Ulger</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Angers">Bishop of Angers</a>, to garner support for her claim with the Pope in Rome, but if she did, Ulger was unsuccessful. Geoffrey invaded Normandy in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded again later the same year, raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory. Stephen returned to the Duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal alliance against Geoffrey and Matilda, to counter the growing <a href="Counts%20and%20dukes%20of%20Anjou">Angevin</a> power in the region. Stephen formed an army to retake Matilda's Argentan castles, but frictions between his Flemish mercenary forces and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the two halves of his army. The Norman forces then deserted the King, forcing Stephen to give up his campaign. Stephen agreed to another truce with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 marks a year in exchange for peace along the Norman borders.

In England, Stephen's reign started off well, with lavish gatherings of the royal court that saw the King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen received the support of <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Pope Innocent II</a>, thanks in part to the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England on the news of Henry's death, taking <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> and other key strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by <a href="Baldwin%20de%20Redvers">Baldwin de Redvers</a> and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.

Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, was one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the <a href="Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Earldom of Gloucester</a>. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the descent into civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it was Robert who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting the claim of Matilda to the throne, pushing south into <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>.

Stephen responded quickly to the revolts and invasions, paying most attention to England rather than to Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, with the task of retaking the key port of <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Standard">Battle of the Standard</a>. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, first striking north into the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>, taking <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a> and <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, before heading south to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. The town of <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support, but he remained in Normandy throughout the year, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the Queen's forces later in the year.

By 1139, an invasion of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent the beginning of the year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. <a href="Arnulf%20of%20Lisieux">Arnulf of Lisieux</a> led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had really been a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.

Empress Matilda's invasion finally began at the end of the summer of 1139. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to <a href="Wareham%2C%20Dorset">Wareham</a> in August in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to retreat into the south-west. The following month, the Empress was invited by her stepmother, Queen Adeliza, to land at <a href="Arundel">Arundel</a> instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and Matilda arrived in England with a force of 140 knights. Matilda stayed at <a href="Arundel%20Castle">Arundel Castle</a>, while Robert marched north-west to <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a> and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with <a href="Miles%20of%20Gloucester">Miles of Gloucester</a>, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the King and declare for Matilda.

Stephen responded by promptly moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then agreed to a truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may have thought it was in his own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent at this point in the conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a>; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.

After staying for a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda established her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had been only a few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the <a href="Thames%20Valley">Thames Valley</a> as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, but her authority in these areas remained limited.

She faced a counterattack from Stephen, who started by attacking <a href="Wallingford%20Castle">Wallingford Castle</a> which controlled the Thames corridor; it was held by Brian Fitz Count and Stephen found it too well defended. Stephen continued into Wiltshire to attack <a href="Trowbridge%23Castle">Trowbridge</a>, taking the castles of <a href="List%20of%20castles%20in%20Gloucestershire">South Cerney</a> and <a href="Malmesbury">Malmesbury</a> en route. In response, Miles marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was forced to give up his western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.

At the start of 1140, <a href="Nigel%20%28Bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel</a>, the Bishop of Ely, joined Matilda's faction. Hoping to seize <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, he established his base of operations in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Isle of Ely</a>, then surrounded by protective <a href="fen">fen</a>land. Nigel faced a rapid response from Stephen, who made a surprise attack on the isle, forcing the Bishop to flee to Gloucester. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, at which Matilda was represented by Robert. The conference collapsed after Henry and the clergy insisted that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen's representatives found unacceptable.

Matilda's fortunes changed dramatically for the better at the start of 1141. <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Gernon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf of Chester</a>, a powerful northern magnate, had fallen out with the King over the winter and Stephen had placed his castle in Lincoln under siege. In response, Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf advanced on Stephen's position with a larger force, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> on 2 February 1141. The King commanded the centre of his army, with <a href="Alan%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">Alan of Brittany</a> on his right and <a href="William%20le%20Gros%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Albemarle">William of Aumale</a> on his left. Robert and Ranulf's forces had a superiority in cavalry and Stephen dismounted many of his own knights to form a solid infantry block. After an initial success in which William's forces destroyed the Angevins' Welsh infantry, the battle went well for Matilda's forces. Robert and Ranulf's cavalry encircled Stephen's centre, and the King found himself surrounded by the Angevin army. After much fighting, Robert's soldiers finally overwhelmed Stephen and he was taken away from the field in custody.

Matilda received Stephen in person at her court in Gloucester, before having him moved to <a href="Bristol%20Castle">Bristol Castle</a>, traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. Matilda now began to take the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen in his place, which would require the agreement of the Church and her coronation at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a>. Stephen's brother Henry summoned a council at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> before Easter in his capacity as papal legate to consider the clergy's view. Matilda had made a private deal with Henry that he would deliver the support of the Church in exchange for being granted control over Church affairs. Henry handed over the royal treasury to her, which proved to be rather depleted except for Stephen's crown, and he excommunicated many of her enemies who refused to switch sides. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen so rapidly, however, and a delegation of clergy and nobles, headed by Theobald, travelled to Bristol to see Stephen, who agreed that, given the situation, he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.

The clergy gathered again in Winchester after Easter and declared Matilda the "Lady of England and Normandy" as a precursor to her coronation. Although Matilda's own followers attended the event, few other major nobles seem to have attended and the delegation from London procrastinated. Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, wrote to complain and demand her husband's release. Nonetheless, Matilda then advanced to London to arrange her coronation in June, where her position became precarious. Despite securing the support of <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Mandeville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Geoffrey de Mandeville</a>, who controlled the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, forces loyal to Stephen and Queen Matilda remained close to the city and the citizens were fearful about welcoming the Empress. On 24 June, shortly before the planned coronation, the city rose up against the Empress and Geoffrey de Mandeville; Matilda and her followers fled just in time, making a chaotic retreat back to Oxford.

Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou invaded Normandy again and, in the absence of <a href="Waleran%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Waleran of Beaumont</a>, who was still fighting in England, Geoffrey took all the Duchy south of the <a href="River%20Seine">River Seine</a> and east of the <a href="Risle">Risle</a>. No help was forthcoming from Stephen's brother Theobald this time either, who appears to have been preoccupied with his own problems with France—the new French king, <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII</a>, had rejected his father's regional alliance, improving relations with Anjou and taking a more bellicose line with Theobald, which would result in war the following year. Geoffrey's success in Normandy and Stephen's weakness in England began to influence the loyalty of many Anglo-Norman barons, who feared losing their lands in England to Robert and the Empress, and their possessions in Normandy to Geoffrey. Many started to leave Stephen's faction. His friend and advisor Waleran was one of those who decided to defect in mid-1141, crossing into Normandy to secure his ancestral possessions by allying himself with the Angevins, and bringing Worcestershire into the Empress's camp. Waleran's twin brother, <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert of Leicester</a>, effectively withdrew from fighting in the conflict at the same time. Other supporters of the Empress were restored in their former strongholds, such as Bishop Nigel of Ely, and still others received new earldoms in the west of England. The royal control over the <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">minting</a> of coins broke down, leading to coins being struck by local barons and bishops across the country.

Matilda's position was transformed by her defeat at the <a href="Rout%20of%20Winchester">Rout of Winchester</a>. Her alliance with Henry of Blois proved short-lived and they soon fell out over political patronage and ecclesiastical policy; the Bishop transferred his support back to Stephen's cause. In response, in July Matilda and Robert of Gloucester besieged Henry of Blois in his episcopal castle at Winchester, using the royal castle in the city as the base for their operations. Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, had kept his cause alive in the south-east of England, and the Queen, backed by her lieutenant <a href="William%20of%20Ypres">William of Ypres</a> and reinforced with fresh troops from London, took the opportunity to advance on Winchester. Their forces encircled Matilda's army. Matilda decided to escape from the city with Fitz Count and <a href="Reginald%20de%20Dunstanville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Reginald of Cornwall</a>, while the rest of her army delayed the royal forces. In the subsequent battle the Empress's forces were defeated and Robert of Gloucester himself was taken prisoner during the retreat, although Matilda herself escaped, exhausted, to her fortress at Devizes.

With both Stephen and Robert held prisoner, negotiations were held to try to come to agreement on a long-term peace settlement, but Queen Matilda was unwilling to offer any compromise to the Empress, and Robert refused to accept any offer to encourage him to change sides to Stephen. Instead, in November the two sides simply exchanged the two leaders, Stephen returning to his queen, and Robert to the Empress in Oxford. Henry held another church council, which reversed its previous decision and reaffirmed Stephen's legitimacy to rule, and a fresh coronation of Stephen and Matilda occurred at Christmas 1141. Stephen travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully persuade Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including <a href="Cirencester%20Castle">Cirencester</a>, <a href="Bampton%20Castle%2C%20Oxfordshire">Bampton</a> and Wareham.

During the summer of 1142 Robert returned to Normandy to assist Geoffrey with operations against some of Stephen's remaining followers there, before returning in the autumn. Matilda came under increased pressure from Stephen's forces and was surrounded at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the <a href="River%20Isis">River Isis</a>, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping Matilda in the castle. <a href="Oxford%20Castle">Oxford Castle</a> was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen decided to settle down for a long siege. Just before Christmas, Matilda sneaked out of the castle with a handful of knights (probably via a <a href="postern%20gate">postern gate</a>), crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape past the royal army to safety at Wallingford, leaving the castle garrison free to surrender the next day.

In the aftermath of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at <a href="Devizes%20Castle">Devizes Castle</a>, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those that had lost lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. Backed by the pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a drawn-out struggle, and the war soon entered a stalemate.

At first, the balance of power appeared to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at <a href="Wilton%20Castle">Wilton Castle</a>, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wilton%20%281143%29">Battle of Wilton</a>. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.
Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy, and in January 1144 he advanced into <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, the capital of the Duchy, concluding his campaign. Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after.

Despite these successes, Matilda was unable to consolidate her position. Miles of Gloucester, one of the most talented of her military commanders, had died while hunting over the previous Christmas. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion against Stephen in the east ended with his death in September 1144 during an attack on <a href="Burwell%20Castle">Burwell Castle</a>. As a result, Stephen made progress against Matilda's forces in the west in 1145, recapturing <a href="Faringdon%20Castle">Faringdon Castle</a> in Oxfordshire. Matilda authorised Reginald, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Earl of Cornwall</a>, to attempt fresh peace negotiations, but neither side was prepared to compromise.

The character of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; by the late 1140s, the major fighting in the war was over, giving way to an intractable stalemate, with only the occasional outbreak of fresh fighting. Several of Matilda's key supporters died: in 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and Brian Fitz Count gradually withdrew from public life, probably eventually joining a monastery; by 1151 he was dead. Many of Matilda's other followers joined the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a> when it was announced in 1145, leaving the region for several years. Some of the Anglo-Norman barons made individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains, and many were not keen to pursue any further conflict.

Matilda's eldest son Henry slowly began to assume a leading role in the conflict. He had remained in France when the Empress first left for England. He crossed over to England in 1142, before returning to Anjou in 1144. Geoffrey of Anjou expected Henry to become the King of England and began to involve him in the government of the family lands. In 1147, Henry intervened in England with a small mercenary army but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Henry asked his mother for money, but she refused, stating that she had none available. In the end Stephen himself ended up paying off Henry's mercenaries, allowing him to return home safely; his reasons for doing so remain unclear.

Matilda decided to return to Normandy in 1148, partially due to her difficulties with the Church. The Empress had occupied the strategically essential Devizes Castle in 1142, maintaining her court there, but legally it still belonged to <a href="Josceline%20de%20Bohon">Josceline de Bohon</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and in late 1146 <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Pope Eugene III</a> intervened to support his claims, threatening Matilda with excommunication if she did not return it. Matilda first played for time, then left for Normandy in early 1148, leaving the castle to Henry, who then procrastinated over its return for many years. Matilda re-established her court in Rouen, where she met with her sons and husband and probably made arrangements for her future life in Normandy, and for Henry's next expedition to England. Matilda chose to live in the priory of Notre Dame du Pré, situated just south of Rouen, where she lived in personal quarters attached to the priory and in a nearby palace built by Henry.

Matilda increasingly devoted her efforts to the administration of Normandy, rather than the war in England. Geoffrey sent the <a href="Ancient%20Diocese%20of%20Th%C3%A9rouanne">Bishop of Thérouanne</a> to Rome in 1148 to campaign for Henry's right to the English throne, and opinion within the English Church gradually shifted in Henry's favour. Matilda and Geoffrey made peace with Louis VII, who in return supported Henry's rights to Normandy. Geoffrey died unexpectedly in 1151, and Henry claimed the family lands. Henry returned to England once again at the start of 1153 with a small army, winning the support of some of the major regional barons. Neither side's army was keen to fight, however, and the Church <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wallingford">brokered a truce</a>; a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Winchester">permanent peace followed</a>, under which Henry recognised Stephen as king, but became Stephen's adopted son and successor. Meanwhile, Normandy faced considerable disorder and the threat of baronial revolt, which Matilda was unable to totally suppress. Stephen died the next year, and Henry assumed the throne; his coronation used the grander of the two imperial crowns that Matilda had brought back from Germany in 1125. Once Henry had been crowned, the troubles facing Matilda in Normandy died away.

Matilda spent the rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's representative and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.

Matilda helped to deal with several diplomatic crises. The first of these involved the Hand of St James, the relic which Matilda had brought back with her from Germany many years before. <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick I</a>, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered the hand to be part of the imperial regalia and requested that Henry return it to Germany. Matilda and Henry were equally insistent that it should remain at Reading Abbey, where it had become a popular attraction for visiting pilgrims. Frederick was bought off with an alternative set of expensive gifts from England, including a huge, luxurious tent, probably chosen by Matilda, which Frederick used for court events in Italy. She was also approached by Louis VII of France, in 1164, and helped to defuse a growing diplomatic row over the handling of Crusading funds.

In her old age Matilda paid increasing attention to Church affairs and her personal faith, although she remained involved in governing Normandy throughout her life. Matilda appears to have had particular fondness for her youngest son William. She opposed Henry's proposal in 1155 to invade Ireland and give the lands to William, however, possibly on the grounds that the project was impractical, and instead William received large grants of land in England. Matilda was more easy-going in her later life than in her youth, but the chronicler of Mont St Jacques, who met her during this period, still felt that she appeared to be "of the stock of tyrants".

Matilda died on 10 September 1167, and her remaining wealth was given to the Church. She was buried under the high altar at the abbey of Bec-Hellouin in a service led by <a href="Rotrou%20%28archbishop%20of%20Rouen%29">Rotrou</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rouen">Archbishop of Rouen</a>. Her tomb's <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> included the lines "Great by birth, greater by marriage, greatest in her offspring: here lies Matilda, the daughter, wife, and mother of Henry", which became a famous phrase among her contemporaries. This tomb was damaged in a fire in 1263 and later restored in 1282, before finally being destroyed by an English army in 1421. In 1684 the <a href="Congregation%20of%20St.%20Maur">Congregation of St. Maur</a> identified some of her remaining bones and reburied them at Bec-Hellouin in a new coffin. Her remains were lost again after the destruction of Bec-Hellouin's church by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, but were found once more in 1846 and this time reburied at Rouen Cathedral, where they remain.

In the Holy Roman Empire, the young Matilda's court included knights, chaplains and ladies-in-waiting, although, unlike some queens of the period, she did not have her own personal chancellor to run her household, instead using the imperial chancellor. When acting as regent in Italy, she found the local rulers were prepared to accept a female ruler. Her Italian administration included the Italian chancellor, backed by experienced administrators. She was not called upon to make any major decisions, instead dealing with smaller matters and acting as the symbolic representative of her absent husband, meeting with and helping to negotiate with magnates and clergy.

On her return from Germany to Normandy and Anjou, she styled herself as empress and the daughter of King Henry. During the civil war for England, her status was uncertain. The Anglo-Saxon queens of England had <a href="England%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%23Women%20in%20society">exercised considerable formal power</a>, but this tradition had diminished under the Normans: at most their queens ruled temporarily as regents on their husbands' behalf when they were away travelling, rather than in their own right. Initially between 1139 and 1141 Matilda referred to herself as acting as a "<a href="feme%20sole">feme sole</a>", "a woman acting alone", highlighting her autonomy and independence from her husband Geoffrey. She had an imperial great seal created, which was round like the seal of a king – queens used an oval seal – but which showed Matilda enthroned as an empress and titled as the Queen of the Romans. The seal did not show her on horseback, however, as a male ruler would have been depicted. Since she was never crowned at Westminster, during the rest of the war she appears to have used her title of Lady of the English, rather than that of the Queen of England, although some contemporaries referred to her by the royal title.

Matilda presented herself as continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, and attempted to maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor. Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her cause. She appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen. She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks went on to become bishops in Normandy. Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales. The first were initially minted in Oxford during her stay there, and the design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln. A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.

On returning to Normandy for the last time in 1148, Matilda ceased to use the title Lady of the English, simply styling herself as empress again; she never adopted the title of Countess of Anjou. Matilda's household became smaller, and often merged with Henry's own court when the two were co-located in Rouen. She continued to play a special role in the government of the area around Argentan, where she held feudal rights from the grants made at the time of her second marriage.

It is unclear how strong Matilda's personal piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like other members of the Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> monastery of <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluny</a> alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the <a href="School%20of%20Saint%20Victor">Victorines</a> and <a href="Premonstratensians">Premonstratensians</a>. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>.

As time went by, Matilda directed more of her attention to the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> order. This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian <a href="Mortemer%20Abbey">Mortemer Abbey</a> in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.

Contemporary chroniclers in England, France, Germany and Italy documented many aspects of Matilda's life, although the only biography of her, apparently written by Arnulf of Lisieux, has been lost. The chroniclers took a range of perspectives on her. In Germany, the chroniclers praised Matilda extensively and her reputation as the "good Matilda" remained positive. During the years of the Anarchy, works such as the "Gesta Stephani" took a much more negative tone, praising Stephen and condemning Matilda. Once Henry II assumed the throne, the tone of the chroniclers towards Matilda became more positive. Legends spread in the years after Matilda's death, including the suggestion that her first husband, Henry, had not died but had in fact secretly become a hermit – making Matilda's second marriage illegitimate – and a tale that Matilda had an affair with Stephen, resulting in the conception of Henry II.

Tudor scholars were interested in Matilda's right of succession. According to 16th century standards, Matilda had a clear right to the English throne, and academics therefore struggled to explain why Matilda had acquiesced to her son Henry's kingship at the end of the war, rather than ruling directly herself. By the 18th century, historians such as <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> had a much better understanding of the irregular nature of 12th century law and custom and this question became less relevant. By the 19th century, the archival sources on Matilda's life, including charters, foundation histories, and letters, were being uncovered and analysed. Historians <a href="Kate%20Norgate">Kate Norgate</a>, Sir James Ramsay and <a href="J.%20H.%20Round">J. H. Round</a> used these to produce new, richer accounts of Matilda and the civil war; Ramsay's account, using the "Gesta Stephani", was not complimentary, while Norgate, drawing on French sources, was more neutral in tone. The German academic Oskar Rössler's 1897 biography drew heavily on German charters, not extensively used by Anglophone historians.

Matilda has attracted relatively little attention from modern English academics, being treated as a marginal figure in comparison to other contemporaries, particularly her rival Stephen, in contrast to the work carried out by German scholars on her time in the Empire. Popular, but not always accurate, biographies were written by the <a href="Richard%20Onslow%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Onslow">Earl of Onslow</a> in 1939 and Nesta Pain in 1978, but the only major academic biography in English remains <a href="Marjorie%20Chibnall">Marjorie Chibnall</a>'s 1991 work. Interpretations of Matilda's character have shifted over time, but there is, as Chibnall describes, a "general agreement that she was either proud or at least keenly conscious of the high status of an empress". Like both Henry I and Henry II, Matilda had a certain autocratic grandeur, which was combined with a firm moral belief in her cause; ultimately however she was limited by the political conventions of the 12th century. The treatment of Matilda by modern historians has been challenged by feminist scholars, including Fiona Tolhurst, who believe some traditional assumptions about her role and personality show gender bias. In this interpretation, Matilda has been unfairly criticised for showing qualities that have been considered praiseworthy when seen in her male contemporaries.

The civil war years of Matilda's life have been the subject of <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>. Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in <a href="Ellis%20Peters">Ellis Peters</a>'s historical detective series about <a href="Brother%20Cadfael">Brother Cadfael</a>, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>'s decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem "<a href="Maud%20and%20Other%20Poems">Maud</a>".

Phoenix (constellation)

Phoenix is a minor <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="southern%20sky">southern sky</a>. Named after the mythical <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">phoenix</a>, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in his 1603 "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted the brighter stars and gave their <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° <a href="declination">declination</a>, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a>. The constellations Phoenix, <a href="Grus%20%28constellation%29">Grus</a>, <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> and <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a>, are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, <a href="Alpha%20Phoenicis">Alpha Phoenicis</a>, is named Ankaa, an <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is <a href="Beta%20Phoenicis">Beta Phoenicis</a>, actually a <a href="Binary%20star">binary</a> system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. <a href="Nu%20Phoenicis">Nu Phoenicis</a> has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a>s <a href="El%20Gordo%20%28galaxy%20cluster%29">El Gordo</a> and the <a href="Phoenix%20Cluster">Phoenix Cluster</a>—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the <a href="visible%20universe">visible universe</a>. Phoenix is the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> of two annual <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s: the <a href="Phoenicids">Phoenicids</a> in December, and the July Phoenicids.

Phoenix was the largest of the twelve constellations established by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name "Den voghel Fenicx", "The Bird Phoenix", symbolising the <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">phoenix</a> of classical mythology. One name of the brightest star <a href="Alpha%20Phoenicis">Alpha Phoenicis</a>—Ankaa—is derived from the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> العنقاء "al-‘anqā’" "the phoenix", and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and <a href="La%20Caille">La Caille</a>, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, "Al Ri'āl", or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, "Al Zaurak", on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed, "the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention."

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, <a href="Ankaa">Ankaa</a> (<a href="Alpha%20Phoenicis">Alpha Phoenicis</a>), and stars from the adjacent constellation <a href="Sculptor%20%28constellation%29">Sculptor</a> to depict "Bakui", a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of <a href="Grus%20%28constellation%29">Grus</a> together were seen by <a href="Julius%20Schiller">Julius Schiller</a> as portraying <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a> the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> and <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a>, are called the Southern Birds.

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by <a href="Fornax">Fornax</a> and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of <a href="Hydrus">Hydrus</a> to the south, and <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a> to the east and southeast. The bright star <a href="Achernar">Achernar</a> is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Phe'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the <a href="40th%20parallel%20north">40th parallel</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the <a href="equator">equator</a>. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, <a href="Fomalhaut">Fomalhaut</a> and <a href="Beta%20Ceti">Beta Ceti</a>—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.

A curved line of stars comprising Alpha, <a href="Kappa%20Phoenicis">Kappa</a>, <a href="Mu%20Phoenicis">Mu</a>, <a href="Beta%20Phoenicis">Beta</a>, <a href="Nu%20Phoenicis">Nu</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Phoenicis">Gamma Phoenicis</a> was seen as a boat by the ancient Arabs. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted and designated 27 stars with the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.

Ankaa is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant of <a href="apparent%20visual%20magnitude">apparent visual magnitude</a> 2.37 and <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> K0.5IIIb, 77 light years distant from Earth and orbited by a secondary object about which little is known. Lying close by Ankaa is <a href="Kappa%20Phoenicis">Kappa Phoenicis</a>, a <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star of spectral type A5IVn and apparent magnitude 3.90. Located centrally in the asterism, <a href="Beta%20Phoenicis">Beta Phoenicis</a> is the second brightest star in the constellation and another <a href="Binary%20star">binary</a> star. Together the stars, both yellow giants of spectral type G8, shine with an apparent magnitude of 3.31, though the components are of individual apparent magnitudes of 4.0 and 4.1 and orbit each other every 168 years. <a href="Zeta%20Phoenicis">Zeta Phoenicis</a> or "Wurren" is an <a href="Algol%20variable">Algol</a>-type <a href="Binary%20star%23Eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary</a>, with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> fluctuating between 3.9 and 4.4 with a period of around 1.7 days (40 hours); its dimming results from the component two blue-white B-type stars, which orbit and block out each other from Earth. The two stars are 0.05 AU from each other, while a third star is around 600 AU away from the pair, and has an orbital period exceeding 5000 years. The system is around 300 light years distant. In 1976, researchers Clausen, Gyldenkerne, and Grønbech calculated that a nearby 8th magnitude star is a fourth member of the system.

Gamma Phoenicis is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M0IIIa and varies between magnitudes 3.39 and 3.49. It lies 235 light years away. <a href="Psi%20Phoenicis">Psi Phoenicis</a> is another red giant, this time of spectral type M4III, and has an apparent magnitude that ranges between 4.3 and 4.5 over a period of around 30 days. Lying 340 light years away, it has around 85 times the diameter, but only 85% of the mass, of our sun. <a href="W%20Phoenicis">W Phoenicis</a> is a <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a>, ranging from magnitude 8.1 to 14.4 over 333.95 days. A red giant, its spectrum ranges between M5e and M6e. Located 6.5 degrees west of Ankaa is <a href="SX%20Phoenicis">SX Phoenicis</a>, a variable star which ranges from magnitude 7.1 to 7.5 over a period of a mere 79 minutes. Its spectral type varies between A2 and F4. It gives its name to a group of stars known as <a href="SX%20Phoenicis%20variable">SX Phoenicis variable</a>s. <a href="Rho%20Phoenicis">Rho</a> and <a href="BD%20Phoenicis">BD Phoenicis</a> are <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>s—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="astroseismology">astroseismology</a>. Rho is spectral type F2III, and ranges between magnitudes 5.20 and 5.26 over a period of 2.85 hours. BD is of spectral type A1V, and ranges between magnitudes 5.90 and 5.94.

<a href="Nu%20Phoenicis">Nu Phoenicis</a> is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. <a href="Gliese%20915">Gliese 915</a> is a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a> of 10 (2.45 · 10) <a href="centimetre">cm</a>·<a href="second">s</a>, or approximately 250,000 of <a href="Earth%27s%20gravity">Earth's</a>.

Ten stars have been found to have planets to date, and four planetary systems have been discovered with the <a href="SuperWASP">SuperWASP</a> project. <a href="HD%20142">HD 142</a> is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (<a href="HD%20142%20b">HD 142 b</a>)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. <a href="HD%202039">HD 2039</a> is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (<a href="HD%202039%20b">HD 2039 b</a>) six times the mass of Jupiter. <a href="WASP-18">WASP-18</a> is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (<a href="WASP-18b">WASP-18b</a>) taking less than a day to orbit the star.

Gustav Holst

Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874 – 25 May 1934) was an English composer, arranger and teacher. Best known for his orchestral suite "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>", he composed a large number of other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> and <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the <a href="English%20folk%20music%23Folk%20revivals%201890%E2%80%931969">English folksong revival</a> of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.

There were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by <a href="neuritis">neuritis</a> in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> under <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the <a href="trombone">trombone</a> professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.

Holst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of "The Planets" in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including <a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Edmund Rubbra</a>, <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>. Apart from "The Planets" and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.

Holst was born in <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, "née" Lediard. She was of mostly British descent, daughter of a respected <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a> solicitor; the Holst side of the family was of mixed Swedish, Latvian and German ancestry, with at least one professional musician in each of the previous three generations.

One of Holst's great-grandfathers, Matthias Holst, born in Riga, Latvia, <a href="Baltic%20Germans">was of German origin</a>; he served as composer and harp-teacher to the Imperial Russian Court in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">St Petersburg</a>. Matthias's son Gustavus, who moved to England with his parents as a child in 1802, was a composer of salon-style music and a well-known harp teacher. He appropriated the aristocratic prefix "von" and added it to the family name in the hope of gaining enhanced prestige and attracting pupils.

Holst's father, Adolph von Holst, became organist and choirmaster at <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Cheltenham">All Saints' Church</a>, Cheltenham; he also taught, and gave piano recitals. His wife, Clara, a former pupil, was a talented singer and pianist. They had two sons; Gustav's younger brother, Emil Gottfried, became known as <a href="Ernest%20Cossart">Ernest Cossart</a>, a successful actor in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>, New York and <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>. Clara died in February 1882, and the family moved to another house in Cheltenham, where Adolph recruited his sister Nina to help raise the boys. Gustav recognised her devotion to the family and dedicated several of his early compositions to her. In 1885 Adolph married Mary Thorley Stone, another of his pupils. They had two sons, Matthias (known as "Max") and Evelyn ("Thorley"). Mary von Holst was absorbed in <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophy</a> and not greatly interested in domestic matters. All four of Adolph's sons were subject to what one biographer calls "benign neglect", and Gustav in particular was "not overburdened with attention or understanding, with a weak sight and a weak chest, both neglected—he was 'miserable and scared'."

Holst was taught to play the piano and the violin; he enjoyed the former but hated the latter. At the age of twelve he took up the trombone at Adolph's suggestion, thinking that playing a brass instrument might improve his <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. Holst was educated at <a href="Pate%27s%20Grammar%20School">Cheltenham Grammar School</a> between 1886 and 1891. He started composing in or about 1886; inspired by <a href="Thomas%20Babington%20Macaulay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Macaulay">Macaulay</a>'s poem "" he began, but soon abandoned, an ambitious setting of the work for chorus and orchestra. His early compositions included piano pieces, organ voluntaries, songs, anthems and a symphony (from 1892). His main influences at this stage were <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a> and above all <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a>.

Adolph tried to steer his son away from composition, hoping that he would have a career as a pianist. Holst was oversensitive and miserable. His eyes were weak, but no one realized that he needed to wear spectacles. Holst's health played a decisive part in his musical future; he had never been strong, and in addition to his asthma and poor eyesight he suffered from <a href="neuritis">neuritis</a>, which made playing the piano difficult. He said that the affected arm was "like a jelly overcharged with electricity".

After Holst left school in 1891, Adolph paid for him to spend four months in Oxford studying <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> with George Frederick Sims, organist of <a href="Merton%20College%2C%20Oxford">Merton College</a>. On his return, Holst obtained his first professional appointment, aged seventeen, as organist and choirmaster at <a href="Wyck%20Rissington">Wyck Rissington</a>, Gloucestershire. The post brought with it the conductorship of the <a href="Bourton-on-the-Water">Bourton-on-the-Water</a> Choral Society, which offered no extra remuneration but provided valuable experience that enabled him to hone his conducting skills. In November 1891 Holst gave what was perhaps his first public performance as a pianist; he and his father played the <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> "<a href="Hungarian%20Dances%20%28Brahms%29">Hungarian Dances</a>" at a concert in Cheltenham. The programme for the event gives his name as "Gustav" rather than "Gustavus"; he was called by the shorter version from his early years.

In 1892 Holst wrote the music for an operetta in the style of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>, "Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury". The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by <a href="Samuel%20Coleridge-Taylor">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a>. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from frugality and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.

Holst's professors at the RCM were Frederick Sharpe (piano), William Stephenson Hoyte (organ), George Case (trombone), <a href="Georges%20Jacobi">Georges Jacobi</a> (instrumentation) and the director of the college, <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a> (history). After preliminary lessons with <a href="W.%20S.%20Rockstro">W. S. Rockstro</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Bridge">Frederick Bridge</a>, Holst was granted his wish to study composition with <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>.

To support himself during his studies Holst played the trombone professionally, at seaside resorts in the summer and in London theatres in the winter. His daughter and biographer, <a href="Imogen%20Holst">Imogen Holst</a>, records that from his fees as a player "he was able to afford the necessities of life: board and lodging, manuscript paper, and tickets for standing room in the gallery at Covent Garden Opera House on Wagner evenings". He secured an occasional engagement in symphony concerts, playing in 1897 under the baton of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>.

Like many musicians of his generation, Holst came under <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s spell. He had recoiled from the music of "<a href="G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung">Götterdämmerung</a>" when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but encouraged by his friend and fellow-student <a href="Fritz%20Hart">Fritz Hart</a> he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, "ill-assimilated wisps of "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan</a>" inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, <a href="Herbert%20Howells">Herbert Howells</a>, as "the one man who could get any one of us out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.

In 1895, shortly after celebrating his twenty-first birthday, Holst met <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, who became a lifelong friend and had more influence on Holst's music than anybody else. Stanford emphasised the need for his students to be self-critical, but Holst and Vaughan Williams became one another's chief critics; each would play his latest composition to the other while still working on it. Vaughan Williams later observed, "What one really learns from an Academy or College is not so much from one's official teachers as from one's fellow-students ... [we discussed] every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of "<a href="Jude%20the%20Obscure">Jude the Obscure</a>". In 1949 he wrote of their relationship, "Holst declared that his music was influenced by that of his friend: the converse is certainly true."

The year 1895 was also the bicentenary of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>, which was marked by various performances including Stanford conducting "<a href="Dido%20and%20Aeneas">Dido and Aeneas</a>" at the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre</a>; the work profoundly impressed Holst, who over twenty years later confessed to a friend that his search for "the (or a) musical idiom of the English language" had been inspired "unconsciously" by "hearing the <a href="Recitative">recits</a> in Purcell's "Dido"".

Another early influence was <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a>. In Vaughan Williams's words, "It was now that Holst discovered the feeling of unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a great teacher. A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House <a href="Socialist">Socialist</a> Club in Hammersmith." At <a href="Kelmscott%20House">Kelmscott House</a>, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according to the amount of money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them <a href="madrigals">madrigals</a> by <a href="Thomas%20Morley">Thomas Morley</a>, choruses by <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>, and works by <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful <a href="soprano">soprano</a> two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.

In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year's scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to "learn by doing". Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" had praised his song "Light Leaves Whisper", "a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling".

Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that "man cannot live by composition alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and "<a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a>" with the <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa Opera Company</a> and toured with the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20National%20Orchestra">Scottish Orchestra</a>. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.

Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing <a href="rubato">rubato</a> from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for "the Worm" or any other light orchestra "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was "trashy" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: "To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience."

With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, <a href="Imogen%20Holst">Imogen</a>, born in 1907. In 1902 <a href="Dan%20Godfrey">Dan Godfrey</a> and the <a href="Bournemouth%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra</a> premiered Holst's symphony "The Cotswolds" (Op. 8), the slow movement of which is a lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that "as they were always hard up the only thing to do was to spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany".

While in Germany, Holst reappraised his professional life, and in 1903 he decided to abandon orchestral playing to concentrate on composition. His earnings as a composer were too little to live on, and two years later he accepted the offer of a teaching post at <a href="James%20Allen%27s%20Girls%27%20School">James Allen's Girls' School</a>, <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a>, which he held until 1921. He also taught at the <a href="Mary%20Ward%20Centre">Passmore Edwards Settlement</a>, where among other innovations he gave the British premieres of two Bach cantatas. The two teaching posts for which he is probably best known were director of music at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Girls%27%20School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>, <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, from 1905 until his death, and director of music at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a> from 1907 to 1924.

Vaughan Williams wrote of the former establishment: "Here he did away with the childish sentimentality which schoolgirls were supposed to appreciate and substituted Bach and <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Luis%20de%20Victoria">Vittoria</a>; a splendid background for immature minds." Several of Holst's pupils at St Paul's went on to distinguished careers, including the soprano <a href="Joan%20Cross">Joan Cross</a>, and the oboist and <a href="cor%20anglais">cor anglais</a> player Helen Gaskell.

Of Holst's impact on Morley College, Vaughan Williams wrote: "[A] bad tradition had to be broken down. The results were at first discouraging, but soon a new spirit appeared and the music of Morley College, together with its offshoot the 'Whitsuntide festival' ... became a force to be reckoned with". Before Holst's appointment, Morley College had not treated music very seriously (Vaughan Williams's "bad tradition"), and at first Holst's exacting demands drove many students away. He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.

According to the composer <a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Edmund Rubbra</a>, who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was "a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of <a href="Ebenezer%20Prout">Prout</a> and <a href="John%20Stainer">Stainer</a>, but with a miniature score of "<a href="Petrushka">Petrushka</a>" or the then recently published <a href="Mass%20in%20G%20minor%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Mass in G minor</a> of Vaughan Williams". He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. "I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon ... He frequently took away [because of] his abhorrence of unessentials."
As a composer Holst was frequently inspired by literature. He set poetry by <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> and <a href="Robert%20Bridges">Robert Bridges</a> and, a particular influence, <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, whose words he set in "Dirge for Two Veterans" and "The Mystic Trumpeter" (1904). He wrote an orchestral "Walt Whitman Overture" in 1899. While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had read some of <a href="Max%20M%C3%BCller">Max Müller</a>'s books, which inspired in him a keen interest in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> texts, particularly the <a href="Rigveda">Rig Veda</a> hymns. He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing, and decided to make his own translations, despite his lack of skills as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College, London</a>, to study the language.

Imogen commented on his translations: "He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem naïve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be 'clear and dignified' and that would 'lead the listener into another world'". His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included "Sita" (1899–1906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the "<a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>" (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher <a href="Casa%20Ricordi">Tito Ricordi</a>); "<a href="Savitri%20%28opera%29">Savitri</a>" (1908), a <a href="chamber%20opera">chamber opera</a> based on a tale from the "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>"; four groups of "Hymns from the Rig Veda" (1908–14); and two texts originally by <a href="K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa">Kālidāsa</a>: "Two Eastern Pictures" (1909–10) and "The Cloud Messenger" (1913).

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, British musical circles had experienced a new interest in national folk music. Some composers, such as Sullivan and <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>, remained indifferent, but Parry, Stanford, Stainer and <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28composer%29">Alexander Mackenzie</a> were founding members of the <a href="English%20Folk%20Dance%20and%20Song%20Society">Folk-Song Society</a>. Parry considered that by recovering English folk song, English composers would find an authentic national voice; he commented, "in true folk-songs there is no sham, no got-up glitter, and no vulgarity". Vaughan Williams was an early and enthusiastic convert to this cause, going round the English countryside collecting and noting down folk songs. These had an influence on Holst. Though not as passionate on the subject as his friend, he incorporated a number of folk melodies in his own compositions and made several arrangements of folk songs collected by others. The "Somerset Rhapsody" (1906–07), was written at the suggestion of the folk-song collector <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a> and made use of tunes that Sharp had noted down. Holst described its performance at the Queen's Hall in 1910 as "my first real success". A few years later Holst became excited by another musical renaissance—the rediscovery of English madrigal composers. <a href="Thomas%20Weelkes">Weelkes</a> was his favourite of all the Tudor composers, but <a href="William%20Byrd">Byrd</a> also meant much to him.
Holst was a keen <a href="Ramblers">rambler</a>. He walked extensively in England, Italy, France and Algeria. In 1908 he travelled to Algeria on medical advice as a treatment for asthma and the depression that he suffered after his opera "Sita" failed to win the Ricordi prize. This trip inspired the suite "<a href="Beni%20Mora">Beni Mora</a>", which incorporated music he heard in the Algerian streets. Vaughan Williams wrote of this exotic work, "if it had been played in Paris rather than London it would have given its composer a European reputation, and played in Italy would probably have caused a riot."

In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's "<a href="The%20Fairy-Queen">The Fairy-Queen</a>". The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at <a href="The%20Old%20Vic">The Old Vic</a>, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. "The Times" praised Holst and his forces for "a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work".

After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work "The Cloud Messenger". He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from <a href="H.%20Balfour%20Gardiner">H. Balfour Gardiner</a> to join him and the brothers <a href="Clifford%20Bax">Clifford</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Arnold Bax</a> in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, an interest that later inspired his suite "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>". Holst cast his friends' <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his "pet vice".

In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed "<a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Suite">St Paul's Suite</a>" for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in <a href="Brook%20Green">Brook Green</a>, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a> at <a href="Barnes%2C%20London">Barnes</a>, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in <a href="Thaxted">Thaxted</a>, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.
At Thaxted, Holst became friendly with the Rev <a href="Conrad%20Noel">Conrad Noel</a>, known as the "Red Vicar", who supported the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church; he also developed an interest in bell-ringing. He started an annual music festival at Whitsuntide in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School performed together with local participants.

Holst's "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" carol, "This Have I Done For My True Love", was dedicated to Noel in recognition of his interest in the ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as "The Dancing Day"). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>, demanded in a Saturday message during the service that there should be a greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely "camp followers" caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Holst tried to enlist but was rejected as unfit for military service. He felt frustrated that he could not contribute to the war effort. His wife became a volunteer ambulance driver; Vaughan Williams went on active service to France as did Holst's brother Emil; Holst's friends the composers <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a> and <a href="Cecil%20Coles">Cecil Coles</a> were killed in battle. He continued to teach and compose; he worked on "The Planets" and prepared his chamber opera "<a href="Savitri%20%28opera%29">Savitri</a>" for performance. It was first given in December 1916 by students of the London School of Opera at the Wellington Hall in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>. It attracted no attention at the time from the main newspapers, though when professionally staged five years later it was greeted as "a perfect little masterpiece." In 1917 he wrote "The Hymn of Jesus" for chorus and orchestra, a work which remained unperformed until after the war.

In 1918, as the war neared its end, Holst finally had the prospect of a job that offered him the chance to serve. The music section of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>'s education department needed volunteers to work with British troops stationed in Europe awaiting demobilisation. Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School offered him a year's leave of absence, but there remained one obstacle: the YMCA felt that his surname looked too German to be acceptable in such a role. He formally changed "von Holst" to "Holst" by <a href="deed%20poll">deed poll</a> in September 1918. He was appointed as the YMCA's musical organiser for the Near East, based in <a href="Thessaloniki">Salonica</a>.
Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a> recalled, "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do "The Planets", and you've got to conduct'." There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.

The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including <a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced "The Planets" to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.

Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: "it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use". He returned to England in June 1919.

On his return from Greece, Holst resumed his teaching and composing. In addition to his existing work he accepted a lectureship in composition at the <a href="University%20of%20Reading">University of Reading</a> and joined Vaughan Williams in teaching composition at their "alma mater" the RCM. Inspired by Adrian Boult's conducting classes at the RCM, Holst tried to further pioneer music education for women by proposing to the High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School that he should invite Boult to give classes at the school: "It would be glorious if the SPGS turned out the only women conductors in the world!" In his soundproof room at SPGS he composed the "<a href="Ode%20to%20Death">Ode to Death</a>", a setting of a poem by Whitman, which according to Vaughan Williams is considered by many to be Holst's most beautiful choral work.
Holst, in his forties, suddenly found himself in demand. The <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a> vied to be the first to play "The Planets" in the US. The success of that work was followed in 1920 by an enthusiastic reception for "The Hymn of Jesus", described in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" as "one of the most brilliant and one of the most sincere pieces of choral and orchestral expression heard for some years." "The Times" called it "undoubtedly the most strikingly original choral work which has been produced in this country for many years."

To his surprise and dismay Holst was becoming famous. Celebrity was something wholly foreign to his nature. As the music scholar <a href="Byron%20Adams">Byron Adams</a> puts it, "he struggled for the rest of his life to extricate himself from the web of garish publicity, public incomprehension and professional envy woven about him by this unsought-for success." He turned down honours and awards proffered to him, and refused to grant interviews or sign autographs.

Holst's comic opera "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Fool">The Perfect Fool</a>" (1923) was widely seen as a satire of "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>", though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with <a href="Maggie%20Teyte">Maggie Teyte</a> in the leading soprano role and <a href="Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Eugene Goossens</a> conducting, was enthusiastically received at its premiere in the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering <a href="concussion">concussion</a>. He seemed to make a good recovery, and he felt up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.

Holst's productivity as a composer benefited almost at once from his release from other work. His works from this period include the "<a href="Choral%20Symphony%20%28Holst%29">Choral Symphony</a>" to words by <a href="John%20Keats">Keats</a> (a "Second Choral Symphony" to words by George Meredith exists only in fragments). A short Shakespearian opera, "<a href="At%20the%20Boar%27s%20Head">At the Boar's Head</a>", followed; neither had the immediate popular appeal of "<a href="A%20Moorside%20Suite">A Moorside Suite</a>" for brass band of 1928.

In 1927 Holst was commissioned by the <a href="New%20York%20Symphony%20Orchestra">New York Symphony Orchestra</a> to write a symphony. Instead, he wrote an orchestral piece "<a href="Egdon%20Heath%20%28Holst%29">Egdon Heath</a>", inspired by <a href="Thomas%20Hardy%27s%20Wessex">Thomas Hardy's Wessex</a>. It was first performed in February 1928, a month after Hardy's death, at a memorial concert. By this time the public's brief enthusiasm for everything Holstian was waning, and the piece was not well received in New York. <a href="Olin%20Downes">Olin Downes</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" opined that "the new score seemed long and undistinguished". The day after the American performance, Holst conducted the <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Orchestra</a> in the British premiere. "The Times" acknowledged the bleakness of the work but allowed that it matched Hardy's grim view of the world: ""Egdon Heath" is not likely to be popular, but it says what the composer wants to say, whether we like it or not, and truth is one aspect of duty." Holst had been distressed by hostile reviews of some of his earlier works, but he was indifferent to critical opinion of "Egdon Heath", which he regarded as, in Adams's phrase, his "most perfectly realized composition".

Towards the end of his life Holst wrote the "<a href="A%20Choral%20Fantasia%20%28Holst%29">Choral Fantasia</a>" (1930) and he was commissioned by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> to write a piece for military band; the resulting prelude and scherzo "Hammersmith" was a tribute to the place where he had spent most of his life. The composer and critic <a href="Colin%20Matthews">Colin Matthews</a> considers the work "as uncompromising in its way as "Egdon Heath", discovering, in the words of Imogen Holst, 'in the middle of an over-crowded London ... the same tranquillity that he had found in the solitude of Egdon Heath'". The work was unlucky in being premiered at a concert that also featured the London premiere of <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>'s "<a href="Belshazzar%27s%20Feast%20%28Walton%29">Belshazzar's Feast</a>", by which it was somewhat overshadowed.

Holst wrote a score for a British film, "<a href="The%20Bells%20%281931%20film%29">The Bells</a>" (1931), and was amused to be recruited as an extra in a crowd scene. Both film and score are now lost. He wrote a "jazz band piece" that Imogen later arranged for orchestra as "Capriccio". Having composed operas throughout his life with varying success, Holst found for his last opera, "<a href="The%20Wandering%20Scholar">The Wandering Scholar</a>", what Matthews calls "the right medium for his oblique sense of humour, writing with economy and directness".

<a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> offered Holst a lectureship for the first six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a <a href="duodenal%20ulcer">duodenal ulcer</a> prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the <a href="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a>. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the "<a href="Brook%20Green%20Suite">Brook Green Suite</a>", in March 1934.

Holst died in London on 25 May 1934, at the age of 59, of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> following an operation on his ulcer. His ashes were interred at <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a> in Sussex, close to the memorial to Thomas Weelkes, his favourite Tudor composer. Bishop <a href="George%20Bell%20%28bishop%29">George Bell</a> gave the memorial oration at the funeral, and Vaughan Williams conducted music by Holst and himself.

Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with "The Planets", which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic "sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass", while <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a> points to the 12 <a href="Humbert%20Wolfe">Humbert Wolfe</a> settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.

Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional <a href="time%20signatures">time signatures</a>, rising and falling scales, <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a>, <a href="bitonality">bitonality</a> and occasional <a href="polytonality">polytonality</a> — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; "He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: "the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil <a href="Jane%20Joseph">Jane Joseph</a>, Holst fostered in performance "a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible".

Although Holst wrote a large number of works—particularly songs—during his student days and early adulthood, almost everything he wrote before 1904 he later classified as derivative "early horrors". Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an "instinctive orchestral flair". Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst. Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the "Elegy" movement in "The Cotswold Symphony" (1899–1900) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works, and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father's real self in the 1899 "Suite de ballet" and the "Ave Maria" of 1900. She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine voice in his setting of Whitman's verses, "The Mystic Trumpeter" (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in "The Planets" are briefly anticipated. In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality—the use of two keys simultaneously.

At the beginning of the 20th century, according to Matthews, it appeared that Holst might follow <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a> into late <a href="Romantic%20music">Romanticism</a>. Instead, as Holst recognised afterwards, his encounter with Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas" prompted his searching for a "musical idiom of the English language"; the folksong revival became a further catalyst for Holst to seek inspiration from other sources during the first decade or so of the new century.

Holst's interest in Indian mythology, shared by many of his contemporaries, first became musically evident in the opera "Sita" (1901–06). During the opera's long gestation, Holst worked on other Indian-themed pieces. These included "Maya" (1901) for violin and piano, regarded by the composer and writer Raymond Head as "an insipid salon-piece whose musical language is dangerously close to Stephen Adams". Then, through Vaughan Williams, Holst discovered and became an admirer of the music of <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>, whom he considered a "model of purity" on the level with Haydn, another composer he greatly admired.

The combined influence of Ravel, <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> spiritualism and English folk tunes enabled Holst to get beyond the once all-consuming influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss and to forge his own style. Imogen Holst has acknowledged Holst's own suggestion (written to Vaughan Williams): "[O]ne ought to follow Wagner until he leads you to fresh things". She notes that although much of his grand opera, "Sita", is "'good old Wagnerian bawling' ... towards the end a change comes over the music, and the beautifully calm phrases of the hidden chorus representing the Voice of the Earth are in Holst's own language."

According to Rubbra, the publication in 1911 of Holst's Rig Veda Hymns was a landmark event in the composer's development: "Before this, Holst's music had, indeed, shown the clarity of utterance which has always been his characteristic, but harmonically there was little to single him out as an important figure in modern music." Dickinson describes these <a href="Vedas">vedic</a> settings as pictorial rather than religious; although the quality is variable the sacred texts clearly "touched vital springs in the composer's imagination". While the music of Holst's Indian verse settings remained generally western in character, in some of the vedic settings he experimented with Indian "raga" (scales).

The chamber opera "<a href="Savitri%20%28opera%29">Savitri</a>" (1908) is written for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an instrumental combination of two flutes, a cor anglais and a double string quartet. The music critic <a href="John%20Warrack">John Warrack</a> comments on the "extraordinary expressive subtlety" with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: "... [T]he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull." Head describes the work as unique in its time for its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst's most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a> in his music. Dickinson considers it a significant step, "not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [Holst's] vision". Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses "The Cloud Messenger" (1910–12) as an "accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings" which illustrate the composer's creative confusion during that period; the "Two Eastern Pictures" (1911), in Dickinson's view, provide "a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa".

Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite "A Somerset Rhapsody" (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's "Norfolk Rhapsody", Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition "rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs "transformed his orchestral writing", and that the composition of "A Somerset Rhapsody" did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the "Two Songs without Words" of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy "Songs of the West", also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by <a href="James%20Curnow">James Curnow</a>.

In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the "<a href="Beni%20Mora">Beni Mora</a>" suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of <a href="Minimal%20music">minimalism</a> in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in <a href="First%20Suite%20in%20E-flat%20for%20Military%20Band">E flat (1909)</a> and <a href="Second%20Suite%20in%20F%20for%20Military%20Band">F major (1911)</a> respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as "the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire". Also in 1911 he wrote "Hecuba's Lament", a setting of <a href="Gilbert%20Murray">Gilbert Murray</a>'s translation from <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>'s defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with <a href="plainsong">plainsong</a>; the same year saw the enduringly popular "St Paul's Suite" (a "gay but retrogressive" piece according to Dickinson), and the failure of his large scale orchestral work "Phantastes".

Holst conceived the idea of "The Planets" in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology, and also from his determination, despite the failure of "Phantastes", to produce a large-scale orchestral work. The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's <a href="Five%20Pieces%20for%20Orchestra">"Fünf Orchesterstücke"</a>, and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Nocturnes%20%28Debussy%29">Nocturnes</a>" or "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>". Holst began composing "The Planets" in 1914; the movements appeared not quite in their final sequence; "Mars" was the first to be written, followed by "Venus" and "Jupiter". "Saturn", "Uranus" and "Neptune" were all composed during 1915, and "Mercury" was completed in 1916.

Each planet is represented with a distinct character; Dickinson observes that "no planet borrows colour from another". In "Mars", a persistent, uneven <a href="Cell%20%28music%29">rhythmic cell</a> consisting of five beats, combined with trumpet calls and harmonic dissonance provides battle music which Short asserts is unique in its expression of violence and sheer terror, "... Holst's intention being to portray the reality of warfare rather than to glorify deeds of heroism". In "Venus", Holst incorporated music from an abandoned vocal work, "A Vigil of Pentecost", to provide the opening; the prevalent mood within the movement is of peaceful resignation and nostalgia. "Mercury" is dominated by uneven metres and rapid changes of theme, to represent the speedy flight of the winged messenger. "Jupiter" is renowned for its central melody, "<a href="Thaxted%20%28tune%29">Thaxted</a>", in Dickinson's view "a fantastic relaxation in which many retain a far from sneaking delight". Dickinson and other critics have decried the later use of the tune in the patriotic hymn "<a href="I%20Vow%20to%20Thee%2C%20My%20Country">I Vow to Thee, My Country</a>"—despite Holst's full complicity.

For "Saturn", Holst again used a previously-composed vocal piece, "Dirge and Hymeneal", as the basis for the movement, where repeated chords represent the relentless approach of old age. "Uranus", which follows, has elements of <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>'s "<a href="Symphonie%20fantastique">Symphonie fantastique</a>" and <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Dukas</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sorcerer%27s%20Apprentice">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>", in its depiction of the magician who "disappears in a whiff of smoke as the sonic impetus of the movement diminishes from <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29%23Relative%20loudness">fff</a> to <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29%23Relative%20loudness">ppp</a> in the space of a few bars". "Neptune", the final movement, concludes with a wordless female chorus gradually receding, an effect which Warrack likens to "unresolved timelessness ... never ending, since space does not end, but drifting away into eternal silence". Apart from his concession with "I Vow to Thee..."', Holst insisted on the unity of the whole work, and opposed the performance of individual movements. Nevertheless, Imogen wrote that the piece had "suffered from being quoted in snippets as background music".

During and after the composition of "The Planets", Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the "Six Choral Folksongs" of 1916, based on <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> tunes, of which "Swansea Town", with its "sophisticated tone", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as "a limited form of art" in which "mannerisms are almost inevitable"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's "Five English Folk Songs" of 1913.

Holst's first major work after "The Planets" was the "Hymn of Jesus", completed in 1917. The words are from a <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the "Hymn": "At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that <a href="John%20Tavener">John Tavener</a>, for example, was to write in the 1970s". Matthews has written that the "Hymn"s "ecstatic" quality is matched in English music "perhaps only by Tippett's "The Vision of Saint Augustine""; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and "explosive chordal dislocations".

In the "Ode to Death" (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an "abrupt volte-face" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the "Hymn". Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the "Ode" expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer <a href="Ernest%20Walker%20%28composer%29">Ernest Walker</a> thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.

The influential critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> considered "The Perfect Fool" "the best of modern British operas", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by "The Times" as "a brilliant puzzle"—put it outside the operatic mainstream. Only the ballet music from the opera, which "The Times" called "the most brilliant thing in a work glittering with brilliant moments", has been regularly performed since 1923. Holst's libretto attracted much criticism, although <a href="Edwin%20Evans%20%28music%20critic%29">Edwin Evans</a> remarked on the rare treat in opera of being able to hear the words being sung.

Before his enforced rest in 1924, Holst demonstrated a new interest in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, in his "Fugal Overture" of 1922 for full orchestra and the <a href="Neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neo-classical</a>" Fugal Concerto" of 1923, for flute, oboe and strings. In his final decade he mixed song settings and minor pieces with major works and occasional new departures; the 1925 "Terzetto" for flute, violin and oboe, each instrument playing in a different key, is cited by Imogen as Holst's only successful <a href="chamber%20music">chamber work</a>. Of the "Choral Symphony" completed in 1924, Matthews writes that, after several movements of real quality, the finale is a rambling anticlimax. Holst's penultimate opera, "At the Boar's Head" (1924), is based on tavern scenes from Shakespeare's "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Parts 1</a>" and "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">2</a>". The music, which is largely derived from old English melodies gleaned from Cecil Sharp and other collections, has pace and verve; the contemporary critic Harvey Grace discounted the lack of originality, a facet which he said "can be shown no less convincingly by a composer's handling of material than by its invention".

"Egdon Heath" (1927) was Holst's first major orchestral work after "The Planets". Matthews summarises the music as "elusive and unpredictable [with] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody [for strings], a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe." The mysterious dance towards the end is, says Matthews, "the strangest moment in a strange work". Richard Greene in "<a href="Music%20%26amp%3B%20Letters">Music & Letters</a>" describes the piece as "a <a href="Tempo">larghetto</a> dance in a <a href="Siciliana">siciliano</a> rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody", but lacking the power of "The Planets" and, at times, monotonous to the listener. A more popular success was "<a href="A%20Moorside%20Suite">A Moorside Suite</a>" for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, "from the skipping <a href="Time%20signature%23Most%20frequent%20time%20signatures">6/8</a> of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of "Saturn"". 'A Moorside Suite' has undergone major revisionism in the article 'Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of 'The Musical Times'. As with 'Egdon Heath' – commissioned as a symphony – the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.

After this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with "The Wandering Scholar" (1929–30), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as "Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind"; Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: "Do you think there's a "little" bit too much 6/8 in the opera?" Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.

Holst composed few large-scale works in his final years. "A Choral Fantasia" of 1930 was written for the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, "knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of "Egdon Heath"". Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight "Canons" of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The "Brook Green Suite" (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the "St Paul's Suite". The "Lyric Movement" for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for <a href="Lionel%20Tertis">Lionel Tertis</a>. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists. Robin Hull, in "Penguin Music Magazine", praised the work's "clear beauty—impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains "a frail creation". Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music—"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art", according to Short. Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.

Holst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a> company he recorded "Beni Mora", the "Marching Song" and the complete "Planets" with the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> (LSO) in 1922, using the <a href="Recording%20studio%231890s%20to%201930s">acoustic process</a>. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of "Neptune", and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound. With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the "St Paul's Suite" and "Country Song" in 1925. Columbia's main rival, <a href="the%20Gramophone%20Company">HMV</a>, issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by <a href="Albert%20Coates%20%28musician%29">Albert Coates</a>. When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded "The Planets" for Columbia in 1926.

In the early <a href="Long%20playing%20record">LP</a> era little of Holst's music was available on disc. Only six of his works are listed in the 1955 issue of "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>": "The Planets" (recordings under Boult on HMV and <a href="Nixa%20Records">Nixa</a>, and another under <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a> on <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>); the "Perfect Fool" ballet music; the "St Paul's Suite"; and three short choral pieces. In the stereo LP and CD eras numerous recordings of "The Planets" were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Recorded%20Classical%20Music">The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music</a>" contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD. Of the operas, "Savitri", "The Wandering Scholar", and "At the Boar's Head" have been recorded.

Warrack emphasises that Holst acquired an instinctive understanding—perhaps more so than any English composer—of the importance of folksong. In it he found "a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as "the greatest influence on my music", although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a> is acknowledged by Short as Holst's "most significant artistic successor", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: "Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision". Kennedy observes that "a new generation of listeners ... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: "With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone".

Short cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield. Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes—festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, "many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works ... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '<a href="In%20the%20Bleak%20Midwinter">In the Bleak Midwinter</a>'".

On 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death. It is inscribed with words from the text of "The Hymn of Jesus": "The heavenly spheres make music for us". In April 2011 a BBC television documentary, "Holst: In the Bleak Midwinter", charted Holst's life with particular reference to his support for socialism and the cause of working people.

Osiris myth

The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20mythology">ancient Egyptian mythology</a>. It concerns the murder of the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">god</a> <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, a primeval <a href="pharaoh">king of Egypt</a>, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Set</a>, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife <a href="Isis">Isis</a> restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive their son, <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores <a href="Maat">Maat</a> (cosmic and social order) to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to ancient Egyptian conceptions of kingship and <a href="order%20of%20succession">succession</a>, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife</a>. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a> were derived from the myth.

The Osiris myth reached its basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its elements originated in religious ideas, but the struggle between Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Egypt%29">Early Dynastic</a> or <a href="Prehistoric%20Egypt">Prehistoric Egypt</a>. Scholars have tried to discern the exact nature of the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.

Parts of the myth appear in a wide variety of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">Egyptian texts</a>, from <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a> and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more detailed and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account of the myth, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> writings, particularly "<a href="On%20Isis%20and%20Osiris">On Isis and Osiris</a>" by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.

The myth of Osiris was deeply influential in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a> and was popular among ordinary people. One reason for this popularity is the myth's primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife. Another reason is that the characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace. In particular, the myth conveys a "strong sense of family loyalty and devotion", as the Egyptologist <a href="J.%20Gwyn%20Griffiths">J. Gwyn Griffiths</a> put it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

With this widespread appeal, the myth appears in more ancient texts than any other myth and in an exceptionally broad range of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">Egyptian literary styles</a>. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.
The earliest mentions of the Osiris myth are in the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>", the first <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">Egyptian funerary texts</a>, which appeared on the walls of burial chambers in <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a> at the end of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a>, during the 24th century BCE. These texts, made up of disparate <a href="Spell%20%28paranormal%29">spells</a> or "utterances", contain ideas that are presumed to date from still earlier times. The texts are concerned with the afterlife of the <a href="pharaoh">king</a> buried in the pyramid, so they frequently refer to the Osiris myth, which is deeply involved with kingship and the afterlife. Major elements of the story, such as the death and restoration of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> and the strife between <a href="Horus">Horus</a> and <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Set</a>, appear in the utterances of the "Pyramid Texts". Funerary texts written in later times, such as the "<a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>" from the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a>" from the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BCE), also contain elements of the myth.

Other types of religious texts give evidence for the myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the <a href="Dramatic%20Ramesseum%20Papyrus">Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus</a> and the <a href="Ikhernofret%20Stela">Ikhernofret Stela</a>. The papyrus describes the coronation of <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a>, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth Dynasty</a> (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the <a href="Memphite%20Theology">Memphite Theology</a>, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death as well as the resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a>, the <a href="creator%20deity">creator deity</a> of <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>. The text was long thought to date back to the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages in the development of the myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.

Rituals in honor of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found on the walls of <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a> that date from the New Kingdom, the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic</a> era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the deceased person—to live again.

Magical healing spells, which were used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an important portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so that he or she can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone <a href="stela">stela</a> called a "<a href="cippus">cippus</a>". People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.

Episodes from the myth were also recorded in writings that may have been intended as entertainment. Prominent among these texts is "<a href="The%20Contendings%20of%20Horus%20and%20Set">The Contendings of Horus and Set</a>", a humorous retelling of several episodes of the struggle between the two deities, which dates to the <a href="Twentieth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth Dynasty</a> (c. 1190–1070 BCE). It vividly characterizes the deities involved; as the Egyptologist <a href="Donald%20B.%20Redford">Donald B. Redford</a> says, "Horus appears as a physically weak but clever Puck-like figure, Seth [Set] as a strong-man buffoon of limited intelligence, Re-Horakhty <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Ra">Ra</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> as a prejudiced, sulky judge, and Osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue." Despite its atypical nature, "Contendings" includes many of the oldest episodes in the divine conflict, and many events appear in the same order as in much later accounts, suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming at the time that the story was written.

Ancient <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> writers, who described Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded much of the Osiris myth. <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">The Histories</a>", and four centuries later, <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> provided a summary of the myth in his "<a href="Bibliotheca%20historica">Bibliotheca historica</a>". In the early 2nd century AD, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> wrote the most complete ancient account of the myth in "<a href="On%20Isis%20and%20Osiris">On Isis and Osiris</a>", an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch's account of the myth is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, "On Isis and Osiris" includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophies</a>, and its account of the myth contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague <a href="John%20Baines%20%28Egyptologist%29">John Baines</a>, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.

At the start of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having inherited the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or <a href="Atum">Atum</a>. His queen is <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, who, along with Osiris and his murderer, <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Set</a>, is one of the children of the earth god <a href="Geb">Geb</a> and the sky goddess <a href="Nut%20%28goddess%29">Nut</a>. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of "<a href="maat">maat</a>", the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order and disorder, and the disruption of life by death.

Some versions of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the "Pyramid Texts", Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with <a href="Nephthys">Nephthys</a>, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words had the power to affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set takes the form of a wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> were sacred. Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.

By the end of the New Kingdom, a tradition had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two <a href="nome%20%28Egypt%29">nome</a>s, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.
Osiris's death is followed either by an <a href="interregnum">interregnum</a> or by a period in which Set assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband's body with the aid of Nephthys. When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses are often likened to <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s or <a href="kite%20%28bird%29">kites</a>, possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion, because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses' connection with Horus, who is often represented as a falcon. In the New Kingdom, when Osiris's death and renewal came to be associated with the annual <a href="flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">flooding of the Nile</a> that fertilized Egypt, the waters of the Nile were equated with Isis's tears of mourning and/or with Osiris's bodily fluids. Osiris thus represented the life-giving divine power that was present in the river's water and in the plants that grew after the flood.

The goddesses find and restore Osiris's body, often with the help of other deities, including <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, the god of embalming and <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">funerary rites</a>. Osiris becomes the first <a href="mummy">mummy</a>, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.

The cohesive account by Plutarch, which deals mainly with this portion of the myth, differs in many respects from the known Egyptian sources. Set—whom Plutarch, using Greek names for many of the Egyptian deities, refers to as "<a href="Typhon">Typhon</a>"—conspires against Osiris with seventy-two unspecified accomplices, as well as a queen from ancient <a href="Aethiopia">Aethiopia</a> (<a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>). Set has an elaborate chest made to fit Osiris's exact measurements and then, at a banquet, declares that he will give the chest as a gift to whoever fits inside it. The guests, in turn, lie inside the coffin, but none fit inside except Osiris. When he lies down in the chest, Set and his accomplices slam the cover shut, seal it, and throw it into the Nile. With Osiris's corpse inside, the chest floats out into the sea, arriving at the city of <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, where a tree grows around it. The king of Byblos has the tree cut down and made into a pillar for his palace, still with the chest inside. Isis must remove the chest from within the tree in order to retrieve her husband's body. Having taken the chest, she leaves the tree in Byblos, where it becomes an object of worship for the locals. This episode, which is not known from Egyptian sources, gives an <a href="etiology">etiological</a> explanation for a <a href="Cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> of Isis and Osiris that existed in Byblos in Plutarch's time and possibly as early as the New Kingdom.

Plutarch also states that Set steals and dismembers the corpse only after Isis has retrieved it. Isis then finds and buries each piece of her husband's body, with the exception of the penis, which she has to reconstruct with magic, because the original was eaten by fish in the river. According to Plutarch, this is the reason the Egyptians had a <a href="taboo">taboo</a> against eating fish. In Egyptian accounts, however, the penis of Osiris is found intact, and the only close parallel with this part of Plutarch's story is in "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Brothers">The Tale of Two Brothers</a>", a folk tale from the New Kingdom with similarities to the Osiris myth.

A final difference in Plutarch's account is Horus's birth. The form of Horus that avenges his father has been conceived and born before Osiris's death. It is a premature and weak second child, <a href="Harpocrates">Harpocrates</a>, who is born from Osiris's posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus that exist in Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch's version of the myth.

In Egyptian accounts, the pregnant Isis hides from Set, to whom the unborn child is a threat, in a thicket of papyrus in the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>. This place is called "Akh-bity", meaning "papyrus thicket of the king of <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>" in <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a>. Greek writers call this place "Khemmis" and indicate that it is near the city of <a href="Buto">Buto</a>, but in the myth, the physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety. The thicket's special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus and raises him, and hence it is also called the "nest of Horus". The image of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian art</a>.

There are texts in which Isis travels in the wider world. She moves among ordinary humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As in the first phase of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.

In this stage of the myth, Horus is a vulnerable child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the <a href="archtype">archetypal</a> mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.

The next phase of the myth begins when the adult Horus challenges Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the <a href="Ennead">Ennead</a>, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should <a href="royal%20succession">inherit</a> the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in "Contendings", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.

The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the "Pyramid Texts", the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.
The divine struggle involves many episodes. "Contendings" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a <a href="origin%20myth">mythical origin</a> for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.

In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result "gives birth" to the disk. In "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.

Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen <a href="Eye%20of%20Horus">Eye of Horus</a> represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during <a href="lunar%20eclipse">eclipses</a>. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.

In any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of "maat". Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.

As with so many other parts of the myth, the resolution is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.

A different view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him as an integral part of natural order.

With great celebration among the gods, Horus takes the throne, and Egypt at last has a rightful king. The divine decision that Set is in the wrong corrects the injustice created by Osiris's murder and completes the process of his restoration after death. Sometimes Set is made to carry Osiris's body to its tomb as part of his punishment. The new king performs funerary rites for his father and gives food offerings to sustain him—often including the Eye of Horus, which in this instance represents life and plenty. According to some sources, only through these acts can Osiris be fully enlivened in the afterlife and take his place as king of the dead, paralleling his son's role as king of the living. Thereafter, Osiris is deeply involved with natural cycles of death and renewal, such as the annual growth of crops, that parallel his own resurrection.

As the Osiris myth first appears in the "Pyramid Texts", most of its essential features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story by the time of the "Pyramid Texts", which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain "maat", and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.

There are, however, important points of disagreement. The origins of Osiris are much debated, and the basis for the myth of his death is also somewhat uncertain. One influential hypothesis was given by the anthropologist <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a>, who in 1906 said that Osiris, like other "<a href="dying%20and%20rising%20god">dying and rising god</a>s" across the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>, began as a personification of vegetation. His death and restoration, therefore, were based on the yearly death and re-growth of plants. Many Egyptologists adopted this explanation. But in the late 20th century, J. Gwyn Griffiths, who extensively studied Osiris and his mythology, argued that Osiris originated as a divine ruler of the dead, and his connection with vegetation was a secondary development. Meanwhile, scholars of <a href="comparative%20religion">comparative religion</a> have criticized the overarching concept of "dying and rising gods", or at least Frazer's assumption that all these gods closely fit the same pattern. More recently, the Egyptologist Rosalie David maintains that Osiris originally "personified the annual rebirth of the trees and plants after the [Nile] inundation."
Another continuing debate concerns the opposition of Horus and Set, which Egyptologists have often tried to connect with political events early in Egypt's <a href="History%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">history</a> or <a href="Prehistoric%20Egypt">prehistory</a>. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves "followers of Horus", and Horus became the patron god of the unified nation and its kings. Yet Horus and Set cannot be easily equated with the two halves of the country. Both deities had several cult centers in each region, and Horus is often associated with Lower Egypt and Set with Upper Egypt. One of the better-known explanations for these discrepancies was proposed by <a href="Kurt%20Sethe">Kurt Sethe</a> in 1930. He argued that Osiris was originally the human ruler of a unified Egypt in prehistoric times, before a rebellion of Upper Egyptian Set-worshippers. The Lower Egyptian followers of Horus then forcibly reunified the land, inspiring the myth of Horus's triumph, before Upper Egypt, now led by Horus worshippers, became prominent again at the start of the Early Dynastic Period.

In the late 20th century, Griffiths focused on the inconsistent portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, in the early stages of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the "Pyramid Texts". With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess <a href="Nut%20%28goddess%29">Nut</a> or the goddess <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as <a href="Jan%20Assmann">Jan Assmann</a> and George Hart.

Griffiths sought a historical origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, to account for it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were <a href="Nekhen">Nekhen</a>, in the far south, and <a href="Naqada">Naqada</a>, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the <a href="Second%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Second Dynasty</a> (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King <a href="Peribsen">Peribsen</a> used the <a href="Set%20animal">Set animal</a> in writing his "<a href="serekh">serekh</a>"-name, in place of the traditional falcon <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyph</a> representing Horus. His successor <a href="Khasekhemwy">Khasekhemwy</a> used both Horus and Set in the writing of his "serekh". This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.

Noting the uncertainty surrounding these events, Herman te Velde argues that the historical roots of the conflict are too obscure to be very useful in understanding the myth and are not as significant as its religious meaning. He says that "the origin of the myth of Horus and Seth is lost in the mists of the religious traditions of prehistory."

The effect of the Osiris myth on Egyptian culture was greater and more widespread than that of any other myth. In literature, the myth was not only the basis for a retelling such as "Contendings"; it also provided the basis for more distantly related stories. "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Brothers">The Tale of Two Brothers</a>", a folk tale with human protagonists, includes elements similar to the myth of Osiris. One character's penis is eaten by a fish, and he later dies and is resurrected. Another story, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Truth%20and%20Falsehood">The Tale of Truth and Falsehood</a>", adapts the conflict of Horus and Set into an <a href="allegory">allegory</a>, in which the characters are direct <a href="personification">personification</a>s of truth and lies rather than deities associated with those concepts.

From at least the time of the "Pyramid Texts", kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's restoration to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">funerary rites</a> that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife</a>. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with "maat", Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the "<a href="Amduat">Amduat</a>" and the "<a href="Book%20of%20Gates">Book of Gates</a>" liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and "maat", and thus renewed the world itself.

As the importance of Osiris grew, so did his popularity. By late in the Middle Kingdom, the centuries-old tomb of the First Dynasty ruler <a href="Djer">Djer</a>, near Osiris's main center of worship in the city of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>, was seen as Osiris's tomb. Accordingly, it became a major focus of Osiris worship. For the next 1,500 years, an annual festival procession traveled from Osiris's main temple to the tomb site. Kings and commoners from across Egypt built chapels, which served as <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>s, near the processional route. In doing so they sought to strengthen their connection with Osiris in the afterlife.

Another major funerary festival, a national event spread over several days in the month of Khoiak in the <a href="Egyptian%20calendar">Egyptian calendar</a>, became linked with Osiris during the Middle Kingdom. During Khoiak the "<a href="djed">djed</a>" pillar, an emblem of Osiris, was ritually raised into an upright position, symbolizing Osiris's restoration. By Ptolemaic times (305–30 BCE), Khoiak also included the planting of seeds in an "Osiris bed", a mummy-shaped bed of soil, connecting the resurrection of Osiris with the seasonal growth of plants.

The myth's religious importance extended beyond the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which family members or hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took on the role of Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.

The myth influenced popular religion as well. One example is the magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. Another is the use of the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal <a href="apotropaic">apotropaic</a> <a href="amulets">amulets</a>. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.

The ideology surrounding the living king was also affected by the Osiris myth. The Egyptians envisioned the events of the Osiris myth as taking place sometime in Egypt's dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the <a href="Turin%20Royal%20Canon">Turin Royal Canon</a>. Horus, as a primeval king and as the personification of kingship, was regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His assumption of his father's throne and pious actions to sustain his spirit in the afterlife were the model for all pharaonic successions to emulate. Each new king was believed to renew "maat" after the death of the preceding king, just as Horus had done. In <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">royal coronations</a>, rituals alluded to Osiris's burial, and hymns celebrated the new king's accession as the equivalent of Horus's own.

The Osiris myth contributed to the frequent characterization of Set as a disruptive, harmful god. Although other elements of Egyptian tradition credit Set with positive traits, in the Osiris myth the sinister aspects of his character predominate. He and Horus were often juxtaposed in art to represent opposite principles, such as good and evil, intellect and instinct, and the different regions of the world that they rule in the myth. <a href="sebayt">Egyptian wisdom texts</a> contrast the character of the ideal person with the opposite type—the calm and sensible "Silent One" and the impulsive, disruptive "Hothead"—and one description of these two characters calls them the Horus-type and the Set-type. Yet the two gods were often treated as part of a harmonious whole. In some local cults they were worshipped together; in art they were often shown tying together the emblems of Upper and Lower Egypt to symbolize the unity of the nation; and in funerary texts they appear as a single deity with the heads of Horus and Set, apparently representing the mysterious, all-encompassing nature of the Duat.

Overall Set was viewed with ambivalence, until during the first millennium BCE he came to be seen as a totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.

Both Isis and Nephthys were seen as protectors of the dead in the afterlife because of their protection and restoration of Osiris's body. The motif of Isis and Nephthys protecting Osiris or the mummy of the deceased person was very common in funerary art. Khoiak celebrations made reference to, and may have ritually reenacted, Isis's and Nephthys's mourning, restoration, and revival of their murdered brother. As Horus's mother, Isis was also the mother of every king according to royal ideology, and kings were said to have nursed at her breast as a symbol of their divine legitimacy. Her appeal to the general populace was based in her protective character, as exemplified by the magical healing spells. In the Late Period, she was credited with ever greater magical power, and her maternal devotion was believed to extend to everyone. By Roman times she had become the most important goddess in Egypt. The image of the goddess holding her child was used prominently in her worship—for example, in <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a>s that were used in household shrines dedicated to her. Isis's <a href="iconography">iconography</a> in these paintings closely resembles and may have influenced the earliest <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="icon">icon</a>s of <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a> holding <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>.

In the late centuries BCE, the worship of Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she became one of the most popular deities in the region. Although this new, multicultural form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of <a href="mysteries%20of%20Isis">initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris</a>, based on earlier <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">Greco-Roman mystery rites</a> but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.

Through the work of classical writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after the middle of the first millennium AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of the <a href="Writing%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">writing systems</a> that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a major part of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt%20in%20the%20Western%20imagination">Western impressions of ancient Egypt</a>. In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a>s.
