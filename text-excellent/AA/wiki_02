Caesium

Caesium (IUPAC spelling) or cesium (American spelling) is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Cs and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 55. It is a soft, silvery-golden <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a> with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental <a href="metal">metal</a>s that are liquid at or near <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>. Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a>. The most reactive of all metals, it is <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a> and reacts with water even at −116 °C (−177 °F). It is the least <a href="electronegativity">electronegative</a> element, with a value of 0.79 on the <a href="Pauling%20scale">Pauling scale</a>. It has only one stable isotope, <a href="caesium-133">caesium-133</a>. Caesium is mined mostly from <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a>, while the <a href="Radionuclide">radioisotopes</a>, especially <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a>, a <a href="fission%20product">fission product</a>, are extracted from waste produced by <a href="nuclear%20reactor%20technology">nuclear reactors</a>.

The German chemist <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> and physicist <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of <a href="Atomic%20emission%20spectroscopy%23Flame%20emission%20spectroscopy">flame spectroscopy</a>. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "<a href="getter">getter</a>" in <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s and in <a href="Solar%20cell">photoelectric cells</a>. In 1967, acting on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein's</a> proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe, the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> used two specific wave counts from an <a href="emission%20spectrum">emission spectrum</a> of caesium-133 to co-define the <a href="second">second</a> and the <a href="metre">metre</a>. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s.

Since the 1990s, the largest <a href="%23Applications">application of the element</a> has been as <a href="caesium%20formate">caesium formate</a> for <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a>s, but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly <a href="Toxicity">toxic</a>, but the pure metal's tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material, and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.

Caesium is the softest element (it has a hardness of 0.2 Mohs). It is a very <a href="ductility">ductile</a>, pale metal, which darkens in the presence of trace amounts of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. When in the presence of <a href="mineral%20oil">mineral oil</a> (where it is best kept during transport), it loses its metallic <a href="lustre%20%28mineralogy%29">lustre</a> and takes on a duller, grey appearance. It has a <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> of , making it one of the few elemental metals that are liquid near <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>. <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">Mercury</a> is the only elemental metal with a known melting point lower than caesium. In addition, the metal has a rather low <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>, , the <a href="list%20of%20elements%20by%20boiling%20point">lowest</a> of all metals other than mercury. Its compounds burn with a blue or violet colour.

Caesium forms <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s with the other alkali metals, <a href="gold">gold</a>, and mercury (<a href="amalgam%20%28chemistry%29">amalgams</a>). At temperatures below , it does not alloy with <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a>, or <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>. It forms well-defined <a href="intermetallics">intermetallic compounds</a> with <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="indium">indium</a>, and <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, which are <a href="photosensitive">photosensitive</a>. It mixes with all the other alkali metals (except lithium); the alloy with a <a href="molar%20concentration">molar</a> distribution of 41% caesium, 47% <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, and 12% <a href="sodium">sodium</a> has the lowest melting point of any known metal alloy, at . A few amalgams have been studied: is black with a purple metallic <a href="lustre%20%28mineralogy%29">lustre</a>, while CsHg is golden-coloured, also with a metallic lustre.

The golden colour of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group is descended. For lithium through rubidium this frequency is in the ultraviolet, but for caesium it enters the blue–violet end of the spectrum; in other words, the <a href="plasma%20oscillation">plasmonic frequency</a> of the alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium. Thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours (having lower frequency) are reflected; hence it appears yellowish.

Caesium metal is highly reactive and very <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a>. It ignites spontaneously in air, and reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than the other alkali metals (<a href="Alkali%20metal">first group</a> of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>). It reacts with solid water at temperatures as low as . Because of this high reactivity, caesium metal is classified as a <a href="hazardous%20material">hazardous material</a>. It is stored and shipped in dry, saturated hydrocarbons such as <a href="mineral%20oil">mineral oil</a>. It can be handled only under <a href="inert%20gas">inert gas</a>, such as <a href="argon">argon</a>. However, a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a <a href="sodium">sodium</a>-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium. This is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water, leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate. Caesium can be stored in vacuum-sealed <a href="borosilicate%20glass">borosilicate glass</a> <a href="ampoule">ampoule</a>s. In quantities of more than about 100 grams (3.5 <a href="ounce">oz</a>), caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed, stainless steel containers.

The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals, in particular <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a>, the element above caesium in the periodic table. As expected for an alkali metal, the only common oxidation state is +1. Some small differences arise from the fact that it has a higher <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> and is more <a href="Electronegativity">electropositive</a> than other (nonradioactive) alkali metals. Caesium is the most electropositive chemical element. The caesium ion is also larger and <a href="HSAB%20theory">less "hard"</a> than those of the lighter <a href="alkali%20metals">alkali metals</a>.

Most caesium compounds contain the element as the <a href="cation">cation</a> , which <a href="ionic%20bond">binds ionically</a> to a wide variety of <a href="anion">anion</a>s. One noteworthy exception is the <a href="alkalide">caeside</a> anion (), and others are the several suboxides (see section on oxides below).

Salts of Cs are usually colourless unless the anion itself is coloured. Many of the simple salts are <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>, but less so than the corresponding salts of lighter alkali metals. The <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>, <a href="acetate">acetate</a>, <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>, <a href="halide">halide</a>s, <a href="oxide">oxide</a>, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, and <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a> salts are water-soluble. <a href="Double%20salt">Double salt</a>s are often less soluble, and the low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in refining Cs from ores. The double salt with antimony (such as ), <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, and <a href="lead">lead</a> are also poorly <a href="Dissolution%20%28chemistry%29">soluble</a>.

<a href="Caesium%20hydroxide">Caesium hydroxide</a> (CsOH) is hygroscopic and strongly <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a>. It rapidly <a href="etching">etches</a> the surface of <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s such as <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. CsOH has been previously regarded by chemists as the "strongest base", reflecting the relatively weak attraction between the large Cs ion and OH; it is indeed the strongest <a href="Arrhenius%20base">Arrhenius base</a>, but a number of compounds that do not dissolve in water, such as <a href="N-Butyllithium">"n"-butyllithium</a> and <a href="sodium%20amide">sodium amide</a>, are more basic.

A <a href="Stoichiometry">stoichiometric</a> mixture of caesium and <a href="gold">gold</a> will react to form yellow <a href="caesium%20auride">caesium auride</a> (CsAu) upon heating. The auride anion here behaves as a <a href="pseudohalogen">pseudohalogen</a>. The compound reacts violently with water, yielding <a href="caesium%20hydroxide">caesium hydroxide</a>, metallic gold, and hydrogen gas; in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium-specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride. The analogous <a href="platinum">platinum</a> compound, red caesium platinide (CsPt), contains the platinide ion that behaves as a pseudo<a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>.

Like all metal cations, Cs forms complexes with <a href="Lewis%20base">Lewis base</a>s in solution. Because of its large size, Cs usually adopts <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a>s greater than 6, the number typical for the smaller alkali metal cations. This difference is apparent in the 8-coordination of CsCl. This high coordination number and <a href="HSAB">softness</a> (tendency to form covalent bonds) are properties exploited in separating Cs from other cations in the remediation of nuclear wastes, where Cs must be separated from large amounts of nonradioactive K.

<a href="Caesium%20fluoride">Caesium fluoride</a> (CsF) is a <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> white solid that is widely used in <a href="organofluorine%20chemistry">organofluorine chemistry</a> as a source of <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> anions. Caesium fluoride has the halite structure, which means that the Cs and F pack in a <a href="cubic%20closest%20packed">cubic closest packed</a> array as do Na and Cl in <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>. Notably, caesium and fluorine have the lowest and highest <a href="electronegativity">electronegativities</a>, respectively, among all the known elements.

<a href="Caesium%20chloride">Caesium chloride</a> (CsCl) crystallizes in the simple <a href="cubic%20crystal%20system">cubic crystal system</a>. Also called the "caesium chloride structure", this structural motif is composed of a <a href="primitive%20cell">primitive</a> cubic lattice with a two-atom basis, each with an eightfold <a href="coordination%20number">coordination</a>; the chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube, while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the centre of the cubes. This structure is shared with <a href="caesium%20bromide">CsBr</a> and <a href="caesium%20iodide">CsI</a>, and many other compounds that do not contain Cs. In contrast, most other alkaline halides have the <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> (NaCl) structure. The CsCl structure is preferred because Cs has an <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radius</a> of 174 <a href="picometer">pm</a> and 181 pm.

More so than the other alkali metals, caesium forms numerous binary compounds with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. When caesium burns in air, the <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> is the main product. The "normal" <a href="caesium%20oxide">caesium oxide</a> () forms yellow-orange <a href="hexagonal%20crystal%20system">hexagonal</a> crystals, and is the only oxide of the anti-<a href="cadmium%20chloride"></a> type. It vaporizes at , and decomposes to caesium metal and the <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a> at temperatures above . In addition to the superoxide and the <a href="ozonide">ozonide</a> , several brightly coloured <a href="suboxide">suboxide</a>s have also been studied. These include , , , (dark-green), CsO, , as well as . The latter may be heated in a vacuum to generate . Binary compounds with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a> also exist.

Caesium has 39 known <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s, ranging in <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> (i.e. number of <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s in the nucleus) from 112 to 151. Several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by the slow neutron capture process (<a href="S-process">S-process</a>) inside old stars and by the <a href="R-process">R-process</a> in <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions. The only <a href="stable%20nuclide">stable</a> caesium isotope is Cs, with 78 <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. Although it has a large <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a> (+), <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> studies can use this isotope at a resonating frequency of 11.7 <a href="hertz">MHz</a>.

The radioactive <a href="caesium-135">Cs</a> has a very long half-life of about 2.3 million years, the longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium. <a href="caesium-137">Cs</a> and <a href="caesium-134">Cs</a> have half-lives of 30 and two years, respectively. Cs decomposes to a short-lived <a href="barium-137m">Ba</a> by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, and then to nonradioactive barium, while Cs transforms into Ba directly. The isotopes with mass numbers of 129, 131, 132 and 136, have half-lives between a day and two weeks, while most of the other isotopes have half-lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second. At least 21 metastable <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s exist. Other than Cs (with a half-life of just under 3 hours), all are very unstable and decay with half-lives of a few minutes or less.

The isotope Cs is one of the <a href="long-lived%20fission%20product">long-lived fission product</a>s of <a href="uranium">uranium</a> produced in <a href="nuclear%20reactor%20technology">nuclear reactors</a>. However, this <a href="fission%20product%20yield">fission product yield</a> is reduced in most reactors because the predecessor, <a href="xenon-135">Xe</a>, is a potent <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a> and frequently transmutes to stable <a href="xenon-136">Xe</a> before it can decay to Cs.

The <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> from Cs to Ba is a strong emission of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma radiation</a>. Cs and <a href="strontium-90">Sr</a> are the principal <a href="medium-lived%20fission%20product">medium-lived</a> products of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>, and the prime sources of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactivity</a> from <a href="spent%20nuclear%20fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a> after several years of cooling, lasting several hundred years. Those two isotopes are the largest source of residual radioactivity in the area of the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>. Because of the low capture rate, disposing of Cs through <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> is not feasible and the only current solution is to allow it to decay over time.

Almost all caesium produced from nuclear fission comes from the <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of originally more neutron-rich fission products, passing through various <a href="isotopes%20of%20iodine">isotopes of iodine</a> and <a href="isotopes%20of%20xenon">xenon</a>. Because iodine and xenon are volatile and can diffuse through nuclear fuel or air, radioactive caesium is often created far from the original site of fission. With <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear weapons testing</a> in the 1950s through the 1980s, Cs was released into the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">atmosphere</a> and returned to the surface of the earth as a component of <a href="Nuclear%20fallout">radioactive fallout</a>. It is a ready marker of the movement of soil and sediment from those times.

Caesium is a relatively rare element, estimated to average 3 <a href="parts%20per%20million">parts per million</a> in the <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>. It is the 45th most abundant element and the 36th among the metals. Nevertheless, it is more abundant than such elements as <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, and <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and <a href="silver">silver</a>; it is 3.3% as abundant as <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a>, with which it is closely associated, chemically.

Due to its large <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radius</a>, caesium is one of the "<a href="incompatible%20element">incompatible element</a>s". During <a href="Fractional%20crystallization%20%28geology%29">magma crystallization</a>, caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a> ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for <a href="potassium">potassium</a> as readily as rubidium does, the alkali evaporite minerals <a href="sylvite">sylvite</a> (KCl) and <a href="carnallite">carnallite</a> () may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals. Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in <a href="beryl">beryl</a> () and <a href="avogadrite">avogadrite</a> (), up to 15 wt% CsO in the closely related mineral <a href="pezzottaite">pezzottaite</a> (Cs(BeLi)AlSiO), up to 8.4 wt% CsO in the rare mineral <a href="londonite">londonite</a> (), and less in the more widespread <a href="rhodizite">rhodizite</a>. The only economically important ore for caesium is <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a> , which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites, associated with the more commercially important <a href="lithium">lithium</a> minerals, <a href="lepidolite">lepidolite</a> and <a href="petalite">petalite</a>. Within the pegmatites, the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals results in high-grade ore for mining.

One of the world's most significant and richest sources of caesium is the <a href="Tanco%20Mine">Tanco Mine</a> at <a href="Bernic%20Lake">Bernic Lake</a> in <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, Canada, estimated to contain 350,000 <a href="tonne">metric tons</a> of pollucite ore, representing more than two-thirds of the world's reserve base. Although the stoichiometric content of caesium in pollucite is 42.6%, pure pollucite samples from this deposit contain only about 34% caesium, while the average content is 24 wt%. Commercial pollucite contains more than 19% caesium. The <a href="Bikita%20District">Bikita</a> pegmatite deposit in <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> is mined for its petalite, but it also contains a significant amount of pollucite. Another notable source of pollucite is in the <a href="Erongo%20Region">Karibib Desert</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>. At the present rate of world mine production of 5 to 10 metric tons per year, reserves will last for thousands of years.

Mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.

In the acid digestion, the <a href="silicate">silicate</a> pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids, such as <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric</a> (HCl), <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric</a> (), <a href="hydrobromic%20acid">hydrobromic</a> (HBr), or <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric</a> (HF) acids. With hydrochloric acid, a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced, and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride (), caesium iodine chloride (), or caesium hexachlorocerate (). After separation, the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed, and pure CsCl is precipitated by evaporating the water.

The sulfuric acid method yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium <a href="alum">alum</a> (). The <a href="aluminium%20sulfate">aluminium sulfate</a> component is converted to insoluble <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> by roasting the alum with <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, and the resulting product is <a href="leaching%20%28metallurgy%29">leached</a> with water to yield a solution.

Roasting pollucite with <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> and <a href="calcium%20chloride">calcium chloride</a> yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride. Leaching with water or dilute <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> () yields a dilute chloride (CsCl) solution. This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate. Though not commercially feasible, the ore can be directly reduced with potassium, sodium, or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly.

Most of the mined caesium (as salts) is directly converted into <a href="formate">caesium formate</a> (HCOOCs) for applications such as <a href="oil%20drilling">oil drilling</a>. To supply the developing market, <a href="Cabot%20Corporation">Cabot Corporation</a> built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba, with a capacity of per year of caesium formate solution. The primary smaller-scale commercial compounds of caesium are <a href="caesium%20chloride">caesium chloride</a> and <a href="Caesium%20nitrate">nitrate</a>.

Alternatively, caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore. Caesium chloride and the other caesium halides can be reduced at with calcium or <a href="barium">barium</a>, and caesium metal distilled from the result. In the same way, the aluminate, carbonate, or hydroxide may be reduced by <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>.

The metal can also be isolated by <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of fused caesium <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> (CsCN). Exceptionally pure and gas-free caesium can be produced by thermal decomposition of caesium <a href="azide">azide</a> , which can be produced from aqueous caesium sulfate and barium azide. In vacuum applications, caesium <a href="dichromate">dichromate</a> can be reacted with <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a> to produce pure caesium metal without other gaseous products.

The price of 99.8% pure caesium (metal basis) in 2009 was about US$10 per gram ($280 per ounce), but the compounds are significantly cheaper.

In 1860, <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> discovered caesium in the <a href="mineral%20water">mineral water</a> from <a href="Bad%20D%C3%BCrkheim">Dürkheim</a>, Germany. Because of the bright blue lines in the <a href="emission%20spectrum">emission spectrum</a>, they derived the name from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "caesius", meaning sky-blue. Caesium was the first element to be discovered with a <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscope</a>, which had been invented by Bunsen and Kirchhoff only a year previously.

To obtain a pure sample of caesium, of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield of concentrated salt solution. The <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s were precipitated either as sulfates or <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a>s, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After conversion to the <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s and extraction with <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>, a sodium-free mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated by <a href="ammonium%20carbonate">ammonium carbonate</a>. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium form insoluble salts with <a href="chloroplatinic%20acid">chloroplatinic acid</a>, but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water, and the less-soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)PtCl) were obtained by <a href="fractional%20crystallization%20%28chemistry%29">fractional crystallization</a>. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, caesium and rubidium were separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol. The process yielded of <a href="rubidium%20chloride">rubidium chloride</a> and of caesium chloride from the initial 44,000 litres of mineral water.

From the caesium chloride, the two scientists estimated the <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> of the new element at 123.35 (compared to the currently accepted one of 132.9). They tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which "neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance"; as a result, they assigned it as a <a href="Non-stoichiometric%20compound">subchloride</a> (). In reality, the product was probably a <a href="colloid">colloid</a>al mixture of the metal and caesium chloride. The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury cathode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under the aqueous conditions. The pure metal was eventually isolated by the German chemist <a href="Carl%20Setterberg">Carl Setterberg</a> while working on his doctorate with <a href="Friedrich%20August%20Kekul%C3%A9%20von%20Stradonitz">Kekulé</a> and Bunsen. In 1882, he produced caesium metal by electrolysing <a href="caesium%20cyanide">caesium cyanide</a>, avoiding the problems with the chloride.

Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came into use in radio <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s, where it had two functions; as a <a href="getter">getter</a>, it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated <a href="cathode">cathode</a>, it increased the <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>. Caesium was not recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s. Applications for nonradioactive caesium included <a href="Solar%20cell">photoelectric cells</a>, <a href="photomultiplier">photomultiplier</a> tubes, optical components of <a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectrophotometers</a>, catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for <a href="scintillation%20counter">scintillation counter</a>s, and in <a href="MHD%20generator">magnetohydrodynamic power generators</a>. Caesium also was, and still is, used as a source of positive ions in <a href="secondary%20ion%20mass%20spectrometry">secondary ion mass spectrometry</a> (SIMS).

Since 1967, the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Measurements</a> has based the primary unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles at the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> <a href="frequency">frequency</a> of the <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a> corresponding to the transition between two <a href="hyperfine%20structure">hyperfine</a> <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s of the <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a> of <a href="caesium-133">caesium-133</a>. The 13th <a href="General%20Conference%20on%20Weights%20and%20Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> of 1967 defined a second as: "the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields".

The largest present-day use of nonradioactive caesium is in <a href="formate">caesium formate</a> <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a>s for the <a href="extractive%20oil%20industry">extractive oil industry</a>. Aqueous solutions of caesium formate (HCOOCs)—made by reacting caesium hydroxide with <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>—were developed in the mid-1990s for use as oil well drilling and <a href="completion%20%28oil%20and%20gas%20wells%29">completion fluids</a>. The function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits, to bring rock cuttings to the surface, and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well. Completion fluids assist the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining the pressure.

The high density of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3 g/cm, or 19.2 pounds per gallon), coupled with the relatively benign nature of most caesium compounds, reduces the requirement for toxic high-density suspended solids in the drilling fluid—a significant technological, engineering and environmental advantage. Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly. Caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease the density of the fluids to that of water (1.0 g/cm, or 8.3 pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000 per <a href="Barrel%20%28volume%29%23Oil%20barrel">barrel</a> in 2001). Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as <a href="zinc%20bromide">zinc bromide</a> solutions) sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs.

Caesium-based <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s use the <a href="Electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic transitions</a> in the <a href="hyperfine%20structure">hyperfine structure</a> of caesium-133 atoms as a reference point. The first accurate caesium clock was built by <a href="Louis%20Essen">Louis Essen</a> in 1955 at the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%2C%20UK">National Physical Laboratory</a> in the UK. Caesium clocks have improved over the past half-century and are regarded as "the most accurate realization of a unit that mankind has yet achieved." These clocks measure frequency with an error of 2 to 3 parts in 10, which corresponding to an accuracy of 2 <a href="nanosecond">nanosecond</a>s per day, or one second in 1.4 million years. The latest versions are more accurate than 1 part in 10, about 1 second in 20 million years. The <a href="Caesium%20standard">Caesium standard</a> is the primary standard for standards-compliant time and frequency measurements. Caesium clocks regulate the timing of cell phone networks and the Internet.

It is currently (2018) being <a href="2019%20redefinition%20of%20SI%20base%20units">proposed</a> by the <a href="International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (CIPM) that the second, symbol s, the <a href="SI%20unit">SI unit</a> of time, be defined using the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency Δ"ν", the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom.

Caesium vapour <a href="thermionic%20converter">thermionic generators</a> are low-power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy. In the two-electrode <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a> converter, caesium neutralizes the space charge near the cathode and enhances the current flow.

Caesium is also important for its <a href="Photoelectric%20effect">photoemissive</a> properties, converting light to electron flow. It is used in <a href="Solar%20cell">photoelectric cells</a> because caesium-based cathodes, such as the intermetallic compound , have a low threshold voltage for emission of <a href="electron">electron</a>s. The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include <a href="optical%20character%20recognition">optical character recognition</a> devices, <a href="photomultiplier">photomultiplier tubes</a>, and <a href="video%20camera%20tube">video camera tube</a>s. Nevertheless, <a href="germanium">germanium</a>, rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials.

<a href="Caesium%20iodide">Caesium iodide</a> (CsI), <a href="caesium%20bromide">bromide</a> (CsBr) and caesium fluoride (CsF) crystals are employed for <a href="scintillator">scintillator</a>s in <a href="scintillation%20counter">scintillation counter</a>s widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research to detect <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma</a> and <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> radiation. Being a heavy element, caesium provides good stopping power with better detection. Caesium compounds may provide a faster response (CsF) and be less hygroscopic (CsI).

Caesium vapour is used in many common <a href="magnetometer">magnetometer</a>s.

The element is used as an <a href="internal%20standard">internal standard</a> in <a href="spectrophotometry">spectrophotometry</a>. Like other <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>s, caesium has a great affinity for <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and is used as a "<a href="getter">getter</a>" in <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s. Other uses of the metal include high-energy <a href="laser">laser</a>s, <a href="fluorescent%20lamp">vapour glow lamps</a>, and vapour <a href="rectifier">rectifier</a>s.

The high density of the caesium ion makes solutions of caesium chloride, caesium sulfate, and caesium <a href="trifluoroacetic%20acid">trifluoroacetate</a> () useful in molecular biology for density gradient <a href="Differential%20centrifugation">ultracentrifugation</a>. This technology is used primarily in the isolation of <a href="virus">viral particles</a>, subcellular <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s and fractions, and <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s from biological samples.

Relatively few chemical applications use caesium. Doping with caesium compounds enhances the effectiveness of several metal-ion catalysts for chemical synthesis, such as <a href="acrylic%20acid">acrylic acid</a>, <a href="anthraquinone">anthraquinone</a>, <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a>, <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, <a href="phthalic%20anhydride">phthalic anhydride</a>, <a href="styrene">styrene</a>, <a href="methyl%20methacrylate">methyl methacrylate</a> monomers, and various <a href="Alkene">olefins</a>. It is also used in the catalytic conversion of <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> into <a href="sulfur%20trioxide">sulfur trioxide</a> in the production of <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>. 

<a href="Caesium%20fluoride">Caesium fluoride</a> enjoys a niche use in <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a> as a <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a> and as an <a href="anhydrous">anhydrous</a> source of <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> ion. Caesium salts sometimes replace potassium or sodium salts in <a href="organic%20synthesis">organic synthesis</a>, such as <a href="cyclic%20compound">cyclization</a>, <a href="esterification">esterification</a>, and <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a>. Caesium has also been used in thermoluminescent radiation <a href="dosimetry">dosimetry</a> : When exposed to radiation, it acquires crystal defects that, when heated, revert with emission of light proportionate to the received dose. Thus, measuring the light pulse with a <a href="photomultiplier%20tube">photomultiplier tube</a> can allow the accumulated radiation dose to be quantified.

<a href="Caesium-137">Caesium-137</a> is a <a href="Radionuclide">radioisotope</a> commonly used as a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma</a>-emitter in industrial applications. Its advantages include a half-life of roughly 30 years, its availability from the <a href="nuclear%20fuel%20cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a>, and having <a href="Isotopes%20of%20barium">Ba</a> as a stable end product. The high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool irradiators for food and medical supplies. It has been used in agriculture, cancer treatment, and the <a href="sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilization</a> of food, sewage sludge, and surgical equipment. Radioactive <a href="isotopes%20of%20caesium">isotopes of caesium</a> in <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation devices</a> were used in the medical field to treat certain types of cancer, but emergence of better alternatives and the use of water-soluble caesium chloride in the sources, which could create wide-ranging contamination, gradually put some of these caesium sources out of use. Caesium-137 has been employed in a variety of industrial measurement gauges, including moisture, density, levelling, and thickness gauges. It has also been used in <a href="well%20logging">well logging</a> devices for measuring the <a href="electron%20density">electron density</a> of the rock formations, which is analogous to the bulk density of the formations.

Caesium-137 has been used in <a href="hydrology">hydrologic</a> studies analogous to those with <a href="tritium">tritium</a>. As a daughter product of fission bomb testing from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere, where it was absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, and to a lesser extent caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry. While they are less prevalent than either caesium-133 or caesium-137, these bellwether isotopes are produced solely from anthropogenic sources.

Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early <a href="ion%20thruster">ion engines</a> designed for <a href="spacecraft%20propulsion">spacecraft propulsion</a> on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The fuel was ionized by contact with a charged <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> electrode. But corrosion by caesium on spacecraft components has pushed development in the direction of inert gas propellants, such as <a href="xenon">xenon</a>, which are easier to handle in ground-based tests and do less potential damage to the spacecraft. Xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft <a href="Deep%20Space%201">Deep Space 1</a> launched in 1998. Nevertheless, <a href="field-emission%20electric%20propulsion">field-emission electric propulsion</a> thrusters that accelerate liquid metal ions such as caesium have been built.

<a href="Caesium%20nitrate">Caesium nitrate</a> is used as an <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizer</a> and <a href="pyrotechnic%20colorant">pyrotechnic colorant</a> to burn <a href="silicon">silicon</a> in <a href="infrared">infrared</a> <a href="Flare%20%28pyrotechnic%29">flares</a>, such as the LUU-19 flare, because it emits much of its light in the <a href="infrared">near infrared</a> spectrum. Caesium is used to reduce the <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar signature</a> of <a href="exhaust%20gas">exhaust plumes</a> in the <a href="SR-71%20Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a> military aircraft. Caesium and rubidium have been added as a <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> to glass because they reduce electrical conductivity and improve stability and durability of <a href="optical%20fiber">fibre optics</a> and <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a> devices. Caesium fluoride or caesium aluminium fluoride are used in fluxes formulated for brazing <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> alloys that contain <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>.

<a href="MHD%20generator">Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power</a>-generating systems were researched, but failed to gain widespread acceptance. Caesium metal has also been considered as the working fluid in high-temperature <a href="Rankine%20cycle">Rankine cycle</a> turboelectric generators.

Caesium salts have been evaluated as antishock reagents following the administration of <a href="arsenic%20toxicity">arsenical drugs</a>. Because of their effect on heart rhythms, however, they are less likely to be used than potassium or rubidium salts. They have also been used to treat <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>.

Caesium-133 can be <a href="Laser%20cooling">laser cooled</a> and used to probe fundamental and <a href="Quantum%20technology">technological</a> problems in <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum physics</a>. It has a particularly convenient <a href="Feshbach%20resonance">Feshbach</a> spectrum to enable studies of <a href="ultracold%20atom">ultracold atom</a>s requiring tunable interactions.

Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic, and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard. Because biochemical processes can confuse and substitute caesium with <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, excess caesium can lead to <a href="hypokalemia">hypokalemia</a>, <a href="Heart%20arrhythmia">arrhythmia</a>, and acute <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a>. But such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources.

The <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) for <a href="caesium%20chloride">caesium chloride</a> in mice is 2.3 g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD values of <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a> and <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>. The principal use of nonradioactive caesium is as caesium formate in petroleum <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a>s because it is much less toxic than alternatives, though it is more costly.

Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly <a href="explosive%20material">explosive</a> in the presence of water. The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time, causing ignition and a violent explosion. This can occur with other alkali metals, but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can be triggered even by cold water.

It is highly <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a>: the <a href="autoignition%20temperature">autoignition temperature</a> of caesium is −116 °C, and it ignites explosively in air to form <a href="caesium%20hydroxide">caesium hydroxide</a> and various oxides. Caesium hydroxide is a very strong <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>, and will rapidly corrode glass.

The <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s <a href="Caesium-134">134</a> and 137 are present in the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> in small amounts from human activities, differing by location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as readily as other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium). About 10% of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine. The remaining 90% has a biological half-life between 50 and 150 days. Radiocaesium follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues, including fruits and vegetables. Plants vary widely in the absorption of caesium, sometimes displaying great resistance to it. It is also well-documented that mushrooms from contaminated forests accumulate radiocaesium (caesium-137) in the fungal <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">sporocarps</a>. Accumulation of caesium-137 in lakes has been a great concern after the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>. Experiments with dogs showed that a single dose of 3.8 <a href="Curie">millicuries</a> (140 <a href="Becquerel">MBq</a>, 4.1 μg of caesium-137) per kilogram is lethal within three weeks; smaller amounts may cause infertility and cancer. The <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> and other sources have warned that radioactive materials, such as caesium-137, could be used in radiological dispersion devices, or "<a href="dirty%20bomb">dirty bomb</a>s".

Claudio Monteverdi

Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian <a href="composer">composer</a>, <a href="string%20instrument">string player</a> and <a href="choirmaster">choirmaster</a>. A composer of both <a href="Secular%20music">secular</a> and <a href="Religious%20music">sacred music</a>, and a pioneer in the development of <a href="opera">opera</a>, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the <a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> periods of music history.

Born in <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a>, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> where he was "maestro di capella" at the basilica of <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">San Marco</a>. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.

Much of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, <a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi">has been lost</a>. His surviving music includes nine books of <a href="madrigal">madrigal</a>s, large-scale sacred works such as his "<a href="Vespro%20della%20Beata%20Vergine">Vespro della Beata Vergine</a>" ("Vespers") of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera "<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>" (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>" and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>".

While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a>, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a> technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a "<a href="seconda%20pratica">seconda pratica</a>", contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the "<a href="prima%20pratica">prima pratica</a>". Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.

Monteverdi is usually described as an "Italian" composer, even though in his lifetime the concept of "Italy" existed only as a geographical entity. Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced various layers of (mostly foreign) authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families such as the <a href="House%20of%20Gonzaga">Gonzagas</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Medici">Medicis</a>. Above them were the imperial powers – in the sixteenth century primarily Spain – and also the authority of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburgs of Vienna</a>, in their role as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>s, guardians of the Catholic faith.

Monteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as "Claudio Zuan Antonio" the son of "Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo". He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (née Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio's brother <a href="Giulio%20Cesare%20Monteverdi">Giulio Cesare Monteverdi</a> (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona lay under the jurisdiction of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, a Spanish possession, so that Monteverdi was technically born a Spanish subject. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>, in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.

There is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of <a href="motets">motets</a>, " (Sacred Songs)" for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of <a href="Marc%27Antonio%20Ingegneri">Marc'Antonio Ingegneri</a>, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the "<a href="maestro%20di%20cappella">maestro di cappella</a>" at <a href="Cremona%20Cathedral">Cremona Cathedral</a>. The musicologist <a href="Tim%20Carter%20%28musicologist%29">Tim Carter</a> deduces that Ingegneri "gave him a solid grounding in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and composition", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the <a href="viol">viol</a> family and singing.

Monteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, "Madrigali spirituali" (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part <a href="madrigal">madrigal</a>s, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri "the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century ... the secular genre "par excellence"". The first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verità of <a href="Verona">Verona</a>; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the <a href="Senate">Senate</a> of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the <a href="viola%20da%20braccio">viola da braccio</a> in 1587.

 In the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the "vivuola" (which could mean either <a href="viola%20da%20gamba">viola da gamba</a> or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke <a href="Vincenzo%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Vincenzo I Gonzaga</a> of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that "the most noble exercise of the "vivuola" opened to me the fortunate way into your service." In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to "flowers" and his compositions as "fruit" which as it matures "can more worthily and more perfectly serve you", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.

Duke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the "maestro di capella" at the court was the <a href="Flanders">Flemish</a> musician <a href="Giaches%20de%20Wert">Giaches de Wert</a>. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist <a href="Salomone%20Rossi">Salomone Rossi</a>, Rossi's sister the singer <a href="Madama%20Europa">Madama Europa</a>, and the <a href="tenor">tenor</a> Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.

When Wert died in 1596, his post was given to <a href="Benedetto%20Pallavicino">Benedetto Pallavicino</a>, but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599. Here at the town of <a href="Spa">Spa</a> he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the "canto alla francese". (The meaning of this, literally "song in the French style", is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of <a href="Gabriello%20Chiabrera">Gabriello Chiabrera</a>, some of which was set by Monteverdi in his "Scherzi musicali", and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at <a href="Florence">Florence</a> in 1600 for the marriage of <a href="Marie%20de%27%20Medici">Maria de' Medici</a> and <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a>, at which celebrations <a href="Jacopo%20Peri">Jacopo Peri</a>'s opera "<a href="Euridice%20%28Peri%29">Euridice</a>" (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601 Monteverdi was confirmed as the new "maestro di capella".

At the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of musical controversy. The influential <a href="Bologna">Bolognese</a> theorist <a href="Giovanni%20Maria%20Artusi">Giovanni Maria Artusi</a> attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work "L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)" of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of <a href="harmony">harmony</a> and their innovations in use of musical <a href="mode%20%28music%29">modes</a>, compared to orthodox <a href="polyphony">polyphonic</a> practice of the sixteenth century. Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ous supporter, "L'Ottuso Academico" ("The Obtuse Academic"). Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to "the studious reader", he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, "Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music)." This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the "<a href="seconda%20pratica">seconda pratica</a>" which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles ("<a href="prima%20pratica">prima pratica</a>") which was complementary to them.

This debate seems in any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were published in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem "O sirene de' fiumi". The composer of <a href="madrigal%20comedy">madrigal comedies</a> and theorist <a href="Adriano%20Banchieri">Adriano Banchieri</a> wrote in 1609: "I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi ... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation ... enhanced by comparable harmonies." The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi's artistic development: "If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown".

The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the "seconda pratica" was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Doni">Giovanni Battista Doni</a> of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the "seconda practica", in a treatise entitled "Melodia"; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.

In 1606 Vincenzo's heir <a href="Francesco%20IV%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Francesco</a> commissioned from Monteverdi the opera "<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>", to a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio%20the%20Younger">Alessandro Striggio</a>, for the <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a> season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of "Euridice" witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera "<a href="L%27Arianna">L'Arianna</a>" (libretto by <a href="Ottavio%20Rinuccini">Ottavio Rinuccini</a>), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to <a href="Margaret%20of%20Savoy%2C%20Vicereine%20of%20Portugal">Margherita of Savoy</a>. All the music for this opera is lost apart from "Ariadne's Lament", which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment "<a href="Il%20ballo%20delle%20ingrate">Il ballo delle ingrate</a>".

The strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer <a href="Caterina%20Martinelli">Caterina Martinelli</a>, intended for the title role of "Arianna", died of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) "an honourable dismissal". Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his "Vespers" in 1610, which were dedicated to <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a>, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a <a href="seminary">seminary</a>, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.

Duke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting led to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother <a href="Ferdinando%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga</a>. In 1613, following the death of <a href="Giulio%20Cesare%20Martinengo">Giulio Cesare Martinengo</a>, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as "maestro" at the <a href="basilica%20of%20San%20Marco">basilica of San Marco</a> in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 <a href="ducats">ducats</a> for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at <a href="Sanguinetto">Sanguinetto</a> on his return to Cremona).

Martinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the "capella"), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was <a href="Francesco%20Cavalli">Francesco Cavalli</a>, who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of <a href="basso%20continuo">continuo</a> and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new <a href="Mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">mass</a> each year for <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Day">Holy Cross Day</a> and <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s in honour of the Venetian <a href="Doge">Doge</a>, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The <a href="Procurator%20of%20San%20Marco">Procurators of San Marco</a>, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s to 400.

The relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the "<a href="Ballo%23The%20baroque%20ballo">balli</a>" "Tirsi e Clori" (1616) and "Apollo" (1620), an opera "<a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi%23Andromeda%20%281618%E2%80%9320%29">Andromeda</a>" (1620) and an "<a href="intermedio">intermedio</a>", "<a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi%23Le%20nozze%20di%20Tetide%20%281616%E2%80%9317%29">Le nozze di Tetide</a>", for the marriage of Ferdinando with <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Governor%20of%20Siena">Caterina de' Medici</a> (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from "Tirsi e Clori", which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera "<a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi%23La%20finta%20pazza%20Licori">La finta pazza Licori</a>", to a libretto by <a href="Giulio%20Strozzi">Giulio Strozzi</a>, was completed for Fernando's successor <a href="Vincenzo%20II%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Vincenzo II</a>, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.

Monteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of <a href="St.%20Charles%20Borromeo">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, and for the <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> community a <a href="Requiem%20Mass">Requiem Mass</a> for <a href="Cosimo%20II%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Cosimo II de' Medici</a> (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of <a href="Bracciano">Bracciano</a>, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment "<a href="Il%20combattimento%20di%20Tancredi%20e%20Clorinda">Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda</a>" based on an episode from <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>'s "<a href="La%20Gerusalemme%20liberata">La Gerusalemme liberata</a>". In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from <a href="Odoardo%20Farnese%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma">Odoardo Farnese</a>, Duke of <a href="Parma">Parma</a>, for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.

Monteverdi's musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician <a href="Constantijn%20Huygens">Constantijn Huygens</a>, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni and Lucia, wrote that he "heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi ... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four <a href="theorbo">theorbo</a>s, two <a href="cornett">cornett</a>os, two <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s, one "basso de viola" of huge size, organs and other instruments ...". Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20IV%20Vasa">Crown Prince Władysław</a> of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw. He also provided chamber music for <a href="Wolfgang%20Wilhelm%2C%20Count%20Palatine%20of%20Neuburg">Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg</a>, when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.

Correspondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at <a href="Murano">Murano</a>.

Despite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at <a href="University%20of%20Padua">Padua</a> in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the <a href="University%20of%20Bologna">University of Bologna</a>. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the <a href="Roman%20Inquisition">Inquisition</a> in Mantua in 1627 for reading <a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">forbidden literature</a>. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canonry</a>.

A series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the <a href="bubonic%20plague">plague</a>-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, <a href="Alessandro%20Grandi">Alessandro Grandi</a>. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.

By this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's "<a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi%23Proserpina%20rapita%20%281630%29">Proserpina rapita</a> (<a href="Persephone%23Abduction%20myth">The Abduction of Proserpina</a>)", now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of "Scherzi musicali" was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>, and was ordained <a href="deacon">deacon</a>, and later <a href="Priesthood%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">priest</a>, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of the clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.

The opening of the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Cassiano">opera house of San Cassiano</a> in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life and coincided with a new burst of the composer's activity. 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the "Ballo delle ingrate". The eighth book contains a "ballo", "Volgendi il ciel", which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, <a href="Ferdinand%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand III</a>, to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640–1641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, "<a href="Selva%20morale%20e%20spirituale">Selva morale e spirituale</a>". Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's "Accademia degli Unisoni" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, "La vittoria d'Amore", for the court of <a href="Piacenza">Piacenza</a>.

Monteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: "I, Claudio Monteverdi ... come humbly ... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati ... a <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>, yesterday morning ... at the time of the greatest concourse of people ... spoke these exact words ...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat ... and I shit on him and whoever protects him ...

Monteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera "L'Arianna" in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of <a href="Odysseus">Ulysses</a> to his Homeland", 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), "<a href="Lost%20operas%20by%20Claudio%20Monteverdi%23Le%20nozze%20d%27Enea%20con%20Lavinia%20%281641%E2%88%922%29">Le nozze d'Enea e Lavinia</a> (The Marriage of <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> and <a href="Lavinia">Lavinia</a>", 1641, music now lost), and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>" ("The Coronation of <a href="Poppea">Poppea</a>", 1643). The introduction to the printed scenario of "Le nozze d'Enea", by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that "he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time."

In his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Gloriosa%20dei%20Frari">Church of the Frari</a>. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.

There is a consensus among music historians that a period extending from the mid-15th century to around 1625, characterised in <a href="Lewis%20Lockwood">Lewis Lockwood</a>'s phrase by "substantial unity of outlook and language", should be identified as the period of "<a href="Renaissance%20music">Renaissance music</a>". Musical literature has also defined the succeeding period (covering music from approximately 1580 to 1750) as the era of "<a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque music</a>". It is in the late-16th to early-17th-century overlap of these periods that much of Monteverdi's creativity flourished; he stands as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque.

In the Renaissance era, music had developed as a formal discipline, a "pure science of relationships" in the words of Lockwood. In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s ideal, the music was subordinated to the text. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or <a href="monody">monody</a>, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression. This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. <a href="Percy%20Scholes">Percy Scholes</a> in his "<a href="The%20Oxford%20Companion%20to%20Music">Oxford Companion to Music</a>" describes the "new music" thus: "[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were <a href="homophonic">homophonic</a> rather than polyphonic."

Ingegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was a master of the "<a href="musica%20reservata">musica reservata</a>" vocal style, which involved the use of <a href="chromatic">chromatic</a> progressions and <a href="word-painting">word-painting</a>; Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style. Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, "something of an anachronism" according to Arnold, but Monteverdi also studied the work of more "modern" composers such as <a href="Luca%20Marenzio">Luca Marenzio</a>, <a href="Luzzasco%20Luzzaschi">Luzzasco Luzzaschi</a>, and a little later, Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion. He was a precocious and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582–83. <a href="Paul%20Ringer">Paul Ringer</a> writes that "these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality. <a href="Geoffrey%20Chew%20%28musicologist%29">Geoffrey Chew</a> classifies them as "not in the most modern vein for the period", acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the "Canzonette" collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: "These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the <a href="villanella">villanella</a>s of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms".

The <a href="canzonetta">canzonetta</a> form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, Torquato Tasso's "Non si levav' ancor", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: <a href="Pietro%20Bembo">Pietro Bembo</a>'s "Cantai un tempo". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead <a href="Cipriano%20de%20Rore">Cipriano de Rore</a>. Between them is "Ecco mormorar l'onde", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.

A thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi's use of the technique of "imitatio", a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.

Monteverdi's first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.
The third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert, by that time Monteverdi's direct superior as "maestro de capella" at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from "<a href="Jerusalem%20Delivered">Gerusalemme liberata</a>", and <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Guarini">Giovanni Battista Guarini</a>, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses. Of the Guarini settings Chew writes: "The epigrammatic style ... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period ... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances". Chew cites the setting of "Stracciami pur il core" as "a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice". Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.

As the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the "seconda pratica". <a href="Claude%20V.%20Palisca">Claude V. Palisca</a> quotes the madrigal "Ohimè, se tanto amate", published in the fourth book but written before 1600 – it is among the works attacked by Artusi – as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as "échappé". Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, "like a forbidden pleasure". In this and in other settings the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.

The fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their "modernism". However, Ossi describes it as "an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century", closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. There is evidence of the composer's familiarity with the works of <a href="Carlo%20Gesualdo">Carlo Gesualdo</a>, and with composers of the school of <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the "Accademici Intrepidi".

The fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the "<a href="concertato">concertato</a>" style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a "sinfonia" (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.

In Monteverdi's final five years' service in Mantua he completed the operas "L'Orfeo" (1607) and "L'Arianna" (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music, including the "Messa in illo tempore" (1610) and also the collection known as "Vespro della Beata Vergine" which is often referred to as "Monteverdi's "Vespers"" (1610). He also published "Scherzi musicale a tre voci" (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzaga heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the "Scherzi" comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental <a href="ritornello">ritornello</a>s. According to Bowers the music "reflected the modesty of the prince's resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way".

The opera opens with a brief trumpet <a href="toccata">toccata</a>. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the "power of music" – one of the earliest examples of an operatic <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>. Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice's death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.

Act 3 is dominated by Orfeo's aria "Possente spirto e formidabil nume" by which he attempts to persuade <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Caronte</a> to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as "one of the most compelling visual and aural representations" in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally "looks back". The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively <a href="moresca">moresca</a> that brings the audience back to their everyday world.

Throughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a>. He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.

The music for this opera is lost except for the "Lamento d'Arianna", which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.

The musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi "creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera ... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" in the text of Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words "Lasciatemi morire" (Let me die) are accompanied by a <a href="dominant%20seventh%20chord">dominant seventh chord</a> which Ringer describes as "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the <a href="Liebestod">Liebestod</a> in "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" announced <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner's</a> discovery of new expressive frontiers.

Rinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by <a href="Alexander%20Goehr">Alexander Goehr</a> ("<a href="Arianna%20%28Goehr%29">Arianna</a>", 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's "Lament".

The "Vespro della Beata Vergine", Monteverdi's first published sacred music since the "Madrigali spirituali" of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five "sacred concertos" (Monteverdi's term), a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a Vespers service on any <a href="Marian%20feast%20days">feast day of the Virgin</a>. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as <a href="cantus%20firmus">cantus firmus</a>, <a href="falsobordone">falsobordone</a> and Venetian <a href="canzone">canzone</a>, are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of "L'Orfeo", written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.

In this work the "sacred concertos" fulfil the role of the <a href="antiphons">antiphons</a> which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's "Vespers" (for example, those of <a href="Denis%20Stevens">Denis Stevens</a>) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although <a href="John%20Whenham">John Whenham</a> in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.

All the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a> psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional cantus firmus, and is most evident in the "Sonata sopra Sancta Maria", written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures; yet, according to <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a>, "for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre", Monteverdi's chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.

The actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua – concertato had been used by <a href="Lodovico%20Grossi%20da%20Viadana">Lodovico Grossi da Viadana</a>, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the "Sonata sopra" had been anticipated by <a href="Archangelo%20Crotti">Archangelo Crotti</a> in his "Sancta Maria" published in 1608. It is, writes <a href="Denis%20Arnold">Denis Arnold</a>, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.

During his years in Venice Monteverdi published his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. <a href="Hans%20Redlich">Hans Redlich</a> sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the "prima pratica", together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607–08. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of "Lamento d'Arianna", which, says Massimo Ossi, gives "an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by <a href="Giambattista%20Marino">Giambattista Marino</a>, and two settings of <a href="Petrarch">Petrarch</a> which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some "stunning musical moments".

While Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets. There are exceptions, such the two solo "lettere amorose" (love letters) "Se i languidi miei sguardi" and "Se pur destina e vole", written to be performed "genere rapresentativo" – acted as well as sung. Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights "Ohimé, dov'è il mio ben, dov'è il mio core", a <a href="romanesca">romanesca</a> in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet "Tirsi e Clori". This was the height of Monteverdi's "Marino period"; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet's verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi "embraced Marino's madrigalian kisses and love-bites with ... the enthusiasm typical of the period". Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.

The eighth book, subtitled "Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi ..." ("Madrigals of war and love") is structured in two symmetrical halves, one for "war" and one for "love". Each half begins with a six-voice setting, followed by an equally large-scale Petrarch setting, then a series of duets mainly for tenor voices, and concludes with a theatrical number and a final ballet. The "war" half contains several items written as tributes to the emperor Ferdinand III, who had succeeded to the Habsburg throne in 1637. Many of Monteverdi's familiar poets – Strozzi, Rinuccini, Tasso, Marino, Guarini – are represented in the settings.

It is difficult to gauge when many of the pieces were composed, although the ballet "Mascherata dell' ingrate" that ends the book dates back to 1608 and the celebration of the Gonzaga-Savoy marriage. The "Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda", centrepiece of the "war" settings, had been written and performed in Venice in 1624; on its publication in the eighth book, Monteverdi explicitly linked it to his concept of "concitato genera" (otherwise "<a href="stile%20concitato">stile concitato</a>" – "aroused style") that would "fittingly imitate the utterance and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare", and implied that since he had originated this style, others had begun to copy it. The work employed for the first time instructions for the use of <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a> string chords, and also evocations of fanfares and other sounds of combat.

The critic Andrew Clements describes the eighth book as "a statement of artistic principles and compositional authority", in which Monteverdi "shaped and expanded the madrigal form to accommodate what he wanted to do ... the pieces collected in Book Eight make up a treasury of what music in the first half the 17th century could possibly express."

During this period of his Venetian residency Monteverdi composed quantities of sacred music. Numerous motets and other short works were included in anthologies by local publishers such as Giulio Cesare Bianchi (a former student of Monteverdi) and Lorenzo Calvi, and others were published elsewhere in Italy and Austria. The range of styles in the motets is broad, from simple <a href="strophic">strophic</a> arias with string accompaniment to full-scale declamations with an alleluia finale.

Monteverdi retained emotional and political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, large amounts of stage music including at least four operas. The ballet "Tirsi e Clori" survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, but the rest of the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Mantuan%20Succession">wars that overcame Mantua in 1630</a>. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: "Without these links ... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage". Likewise, <a href="Janet%20Beat">Janet Beat</a> regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.

Apart from the madrigal books, Monteverdi's only published collection during this period was the volume of "Scherzi musicale" in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolemeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the <a href="chaconne">chaconne</a> for two tenors, "Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti", as the outstanding item in the collection: "[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work".

"Main articles": "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>"; "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>"; "<a href="Selva%20morale%20e%20spirituale">Selva morale e spirituale</a>"

The last years of Monteverdi's life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. <a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a>, in his "<a href="Oxford%20History%20of%20Western%20Music">Oxford History of Western Music</a>", gives his chapter on this topic the title "Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi." This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian <a href="Nino%20Pirrotta">Nino Pirrotta</a>, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with "Orfeo" in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera "L'incoronazione di Poppea" (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria" and "L'incoronazione" are held by Arnold to be the first "modern" operas; "Il ritorno" is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms "the mythological pastoral". However, David Johnson in "The North American Review" warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> or <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a>: "You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence."

"Il ritorno", says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from "L'Arianna", while the martial episodes recall "Il combattimento". "Stile concitato" is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of <a href="Suitors%20of%20Penelope">Penelope's suitors</a>. In "L'incoronazione", Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; "stile concitato" represents rage. There is continuing debate about how much of the extant "L'incoronazione" music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).

The "Selva morale e spirituale" of 1641, and the posthumous "Messa et salmi" published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure – much else was likely written but not published. The "Selva morale" volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as "the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself". They are followed by a Mass in conservative style ("<a href="Prima%20pratica">stile antico</a>"), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice "Gloria". Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the <a href="1629%E2%80%9331%20Italian%20plague">1631 plague</a>. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two <a href="Magnificats">Magnificats</a> and three "<a href="Salve%20Regina">Salve Regina</a>s". The "Messa et salmi" volume includes a "stile antico" Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm "<a href="I%20was%20glad">Laetatus Sum</a>", and a version of the <a href="Litany%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Litany of Lareto</a> that Monteverdi had originally published in 1620.

The posthumous ninth book of madrigals was published in 1651, a miscellany dating back to the early 1630s, some items being repeats of previously published pieces, such as the popular duet "O sia tranquillo il mare" from 1638. The book includes a trio for three sopranos, "Come dolce oggi l'auretta", which is the only surviving music from the 1630 lost opera "Proserpina rapita".

In his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: "[W]ith truly royal pomp a <a href="catafalque">catafalque</a> was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars". This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator. In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death; according to Severo Bonini writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the "Lamento d'Arianna".

The German composer <a href="Heinrich%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Heinrich Schütz</a>, who had studied in Venice under <a href="Giovanni%20Gabrieli">Giovanni Gabrieli</a> shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there, possessed a copy of "Il combattimento" and himself took up elements of the "stile concitato". On his second visit to Venice in 1628–1629, Arnold believes, Schütz absorbed the concepts of "basso continuo" and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Schütz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and <a href="Giovanni%20Rovetta">Giovanni Rovetta</a> (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco). Schütz published a first book of <a href="Symphoniae%20sacrae%20I">Symphonia sacrae</a>, settings of biblical texts in the style of "seconda pratica", in Venice in 1629. "Es steh Gott auf", from his Symphoniae sacrae II, published in Dresden in 1647, contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.

After the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the "Lamento", prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.
Interest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when <a href="Robert%20Eitner">Robert Eitner</a> published a shortened version of the "Orfeo" score. Around this time <a href="Kurt%20Vogel%20%28musicologist%29">Kurt Vogel</a> scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the "L'incoronazione" manuscript in 1888 and that of "Il ritorno" in 1904. Largely through the efforts of <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during the first quarter of the 20th century: "L'Orfeo" in May 1911, "L'incoronazione" in February 1913 and "Il ritorno" in May 1925.

The <a href="Italian%20nationalism%23Post-Risorgimento%2C%20World%20War%20I%20and%20aftermath%20%281870%20to%201922%29">Italian nationalist</a> poet <a href="Gabriele%20D%27Annunzio">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a> lauded Monteverdi and in his novel "Il fuoco" (1900) wrote of ""il divino Claudio" ... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> (1922–1945), including <a href="Francesco%20Malipiero">Francesco Malipiero</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Dallapiccola">Luigi Dallapiccola</a>, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a> and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>.

In the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 "Vespers" were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the "Selva morales" and "Missa e Salmi" volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.
The revival of public interest in Monteverdi's music gathered pace in the second half of the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards "authentic" performance using historical instruments. The magazine "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" notes over 30 recordings of the "Vespers" between 1976 and 2011, and 27 of "Il combattimento di Tancredo e Clorinda" between 1971 and 2013. Monteverdi's surviving operas are today regularly performed; the website <a href="Operabase">Operabase</a> notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions worldwide in the seasons 2011–2016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers. In 1985 Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi's works, the <a href="Stattkus-Verzeichnis">Stattkus-Verzeichnis</a>, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an "SV" number, to be used for cataloguing and references.

Monteverdi is lauded by modern critics as "the most significant composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; "one of the principal composers in the history of Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, "showing what can only be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a "modern": "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the "stile antico". Thus, says Chew, "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. "And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music."

Cell nucleus

In <a href="cell%20biology">cell biology</a>, the  nucleus (pl. nuclei; from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> or , meaning "kernel" or "seed") is a <a href="biological%20membrane%23Function">membrane-bound</a> <a href="organelle">organelle</a> found in <a href="eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, have <a href="%23Anucleated_cells">no nuclei</a>, and a few others including <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s have <a href="Multinucleate">many</a>.

The cell nucleus contains all of the cell's <a href="genome">genome</a>, except for a small fraction of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, organized as multiple long linear <a href="DNA">DNA</a> molecules in a <a href="protein%20complex">complex</a> with a large variety of <a href="protein">protein</a>s, such as <a href="histone">histone</a>s, to form <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. The <a href="gene">gene</a>s within these chromosomes are <a href="Nuclear%20organization">structured</a> in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the <a href="nuclear%20envelope">nuclear envelope</a>, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>, and the <a href="nuclear%20matrix">nuclear matrix</a> (which includes the <a href="nuclear%20lamina">nuclear lamina</a>), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, which supports the cell as a whole.

Because the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, <a href="nuclear%20pore">nuclear pore</a>s are required to regulate <a href="nuclear%20transport">nuclear transport</a> of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a <a href="Ion%20channel">channel</a> through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and <a href="ion">ion</a>s. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and <a href="RNA">RNA</a> through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of <a href="nuclear%20bodies">nuclear bodies</a> exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a>, which is mainly involved in the assembly of <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate <a href="mRNA">mRNA</a>.

The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist <a href="Antonie%20van%20Leeuwenhoek">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a> (1632–1723). He observed a "lumen", the nucleus, in the <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s of <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.

The nucleus was also described by <a href="Franz%20Bauer">Franz Bauer</a> in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish <a href="botanist">botanist</a> <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> in a talk at the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a>. Brown was studying <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the "areola" or "nucleus", in the cells of the flower's outer layer.

He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, <a href="Matthias%20Schleiden">Matthias Schleiden</a> proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name "cytoblast" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around "cytoblasts". <a href="Franz%20Meyen">Franz Meyen</a> was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the "cytoblast" or otherwise, contradicted work by <a href="Robert%20Remak">Robert Remak</a> (1852) and <a href="Rudolf%20Virchow">Rudolf Virchow</a> (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells ("Omnis cellula e cellula"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.

Between 1877 and 1878, <a href="Oscar%20Hertwig">Oscar Hertwig</a> published several studies on the <a href="fertilization">fertilization</a> of <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a> eggs, showing that the nucleus of the <a href="sperm">sperm</a> enters the <a href="oocyte">oocyte</a> and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a>'s theory that the complete <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a "monerula", a structureless mass of primordial mucus ("Urschleim"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including <a href="amphibians">amphibians</a> and <a href="molluscs">molluscs</a>. <a href="Eduard%20Strasburger">Eduard Strasburger</a> produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, <a href="August%20Weismann">August Weismann</a> postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ "cells" for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> was discovered and the <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian rules</a> were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the <a href="chromosome%20theory%20of%20heredity">chromosome theory of heredity</a> was therefore developed.

The nucleus is the largest <a href="organelle">organelle</a> in animal cells.
In <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The contents of the 
nucleus are held in the <a href="nucleoplasm">nucleoplasm</a> similar to the <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> in the rest of the cell. The fluid component of this is termed the nucleosol, similar to the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> in the cytoplasm.

In most types of <a href="granulocyte">granulocyte</a>, a <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>, the nucleus is <a href="lobation">lobated</a> and can be bi-lobed, tri-lobed or multi-lobed.

The <a href="nuclear%20envelope">nuclear envelope</a>, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two <a href="cell%20membrane">cellular membranes</a>, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the <a href="rough%20endoplasmic%20reticulum">rough endoplasmic reticulum</a> (RER), and is similarly studded with <a href="ribosomes">ribosomes</a>. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER <a href="Lumen%20%28anatomy%29">lumen</a>.

<a href="Nuclear%20pores">Nuclear pores</a>, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as <a href="nucleoporin">nucleoporin</a>s. The pores are about 125 million <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">daltons</a> in <a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a> and consist of around 50 (in <a href="yeast">yeast</a>) to several hundred proteins (in <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s). The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the "nuclear basket" that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.

Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as <a href="karyopherin">karyopherin</a>s. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use <a href="Signal%20transducing%20adaptor%20protein">adaptor proteins</a>. <a href="Steroid%20hormone">Steroid hormone</a>s such as <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a> and <a href="aldosterone">aldosterone</a>, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular <a href="cell%20signaling">signaling</a>, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind <a href="nuclear%20receptor">nuclear receptor</a> proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s when bound to their <a href="Ligand%20%28biochemistry%29">ligand</a>; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as <a href="histone%20deacetylase">histone deacetylase</a>s that repress gene expression.

In animal cells, two networks of <a href="intermediate%20filaments">intermediate filaments</a> provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The <a href="nuclear%20lamina">nuclear lamina</a> forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.

The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of <a href="lamin">lamin</a> proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as <a href="emerin">emerin</a> and <a href="nesprin">nesprin</a>, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the "nucleoplasmic veil", that is visible using <a href="fluorescence%20microscopy">fluorescence microscopy</a>. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a> and is present during <a href="interphase">interphase</a>. Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as <a href="LEM%20domain-containing%20protein%203">LEM3</a>, bind <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a> and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.

Like the components of other <a href="intermediate%20filament">intermediate filament</a>s, the lamin <a href="monomer">monomer</a> contains an <a href="alpha-helix">alpha-helical</a> domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a <a href="protein%20dimer">dimer</a> structure called a <a href="coiled%20coil">coiled coil</a>. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an <a href="Antiparallel%20%28biochemistry%29">antiparallel</a> arrangement, to form a <a href="tetramer%20protein">tetramer</a> called a "protofilament". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike "filament". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.

Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as "<a href="laminopathies">laminopathies</a>". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as <a href="progeria">progeria</a>, which causes the appearance of premature <a href="aging">aging</a> in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated <a href="biochemistry">biochemical</a> changes give rise to the aged <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> is not well understood.

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear <a href="DNA">DNA</a> molecules organized into structures called <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a>, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s familiar from a <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a>. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>.

There are two types of chromatin. <a href="Euchromatin">Euchromatin</a> is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently <a href="gene%20expression">expressed</a> by the cell. The other type, <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a>, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into <a href="Facultative%20heterochromatin%23Facultative%20heterochromatin">"facultative" heterochromatin</a>, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and <a href="Constitutive%20heterochromatin">"constitutive" heterochromatin</a> that consists of chromosome structural components such as <a href="telomere">telomere</a>s and <a href="centromere">centromere</a>s. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called "chromosome territories". Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.

Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, <a href="nucleosome">nucleosome</a>s, have been associated with a number of <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s, such as <a href="systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>. These are known as <a href="anti-nuclear%20antibody">anti-nuclear antibodies</a> (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a> as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of <a href="progeria">progeria</a>, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.

The <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a> is the largest of the discrete densely stained, membraneless structures known as <a href="nuclear%20bodies">nuclear bodies</a> found in the nucleus. It forms around <a href="tandem%20repeat">tandem repeat</a>s of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">rDNA</a>, DNA coding for <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> (rRNA). These regions are called <a href="nucleolar%20organizer%20regions">nucleolar organizer regions</a> (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and <a href="Nucleolus%23Function%20and%20ribosome%20assembly">assemble ribosomes</a>. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.

In the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20I">RNA polymerase I</a> transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits <a href="5.8S%20ribosomal%20RNA">5.8S</a>, <a href="18S%20ribosomal%20RNA">18S</a>, and <a href="28S%20ribosomal%20RNA">28S</a> rRNA. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by <a href="small%20nucleolar%20RNA">small nucleolar RNA</a> (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced <a href="intron">intron</a>s from <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a>s encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the <a href="nuclear%20pore">nuclear pore</a>s.

When observed under the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost "fibrillar centers" (FCs), surrounded by the "dense fibrillar component" (DFC) (that contains <a href="fibrillarin">fibrillarin</a> and <a href="nucleolin">nucleolin</a>), which in turn is bordered by the "granular component" (GC) (that contains the protein <a href="nucleophosmin">nucleophosmin</a>). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.

Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies. These include <a href="Cajal%20body">Cajal bodies</a>, gemini of Cajal bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, <a href="paraspeckle">paraspeckle</a>s, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.

Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of <a href="nemaline%20myopathy">nemaline myopathy</a>. This condition typically results from mutations in <a href="actin">actin</a>, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.

A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called <a href="Cajal%20body">Cajal bodies</a> or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2 µm and 2.0 µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein <a href="coilin">coilin</a>. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically <a href="snoRNA">small nucleolar RNA</a> (snoRNA) and <a href="small%20nuclear%20RNA">small nuclear RNA</a> (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.

Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini constellation</a> in reference to their close "twin" relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain <a href="snRNP">small nuclear ribonucleoproteins</a> (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called <a href="survival%20of%20motor%20neuron%20protein">survival of motor neuron</a> (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the <a href="coilin">coilin</a> component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.

PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> PTF, which promotes transcription of <a href="small%20nuclear%20RNA">small nuclear RNA</a> (snRNA).

<a href="Promyelocytic%20leukemia%20protein">Promyelocytic leukemia bodies</a> (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the <a href="promyelocytic%20leukemia%20protein">promyelocytic leukemia protein</a> (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the <a href="nuclear%20matrix">nuclear matrix</a>, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be <a href="SUMO%20protein">SUMOylated</a>. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.

Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of <a href="interchromatin%20granules">interchromatin granules</a>. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery
splicing <a href="snRNP">snRNP</a>s and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of specific proteins.
The splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), B snurposomes.
B snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in "Drosophila melanogaster" embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei.
IGCs function as storage sites for the splicing factors.

Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, <a href="paraspeckle">paraspeckle</a>s are irregularly shaped compartments in the interchromatin space of the nucleus. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10–30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the "para" is short for parallel and the "speckles" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.

Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the <a href="nucleolus">nucleolus</a>. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>, paraspeckles are present during <a href="interphase">interphase</a> and during all of <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> except for <a href="telophase">telophase</a>. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no <a href="RNA">RNA</a> Pol II <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.

Perichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active <a href="precursor%20mRNA">pre-mRNA</a> processing.

Clastosomes are small nuclear bodies (0.2–0.5 µm) described as having a thick ring-shape due to the peripheral capsule around these bodies. This name is derived from the Greek "klastos", broken and "soma", body. Clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells, making them hard to detect. They form under high proteolysis conditions within the nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with <a href="proteasome%20inhibitor">proteasome inhibitor</a>s. The scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for <a href="proteasome">proteasome</a> function. Osmotic stress has also been shown to cause the formation of clastosomes. These nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory sub-units of the proteasome and its substrates, indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins.

The nucleus provides a site for genetic <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> that is segregated from the location of <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a> in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of <a href="gene%20regulation">gene regulation</a> that are not available to <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>.

The nucleus is an <a href="organelle">organelle</a> found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear <a href="membrane">membrane</a>, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as <a href="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="molecules">molecules</a>, along with a variety of <a href="proteins">proteins</a>, to form <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a>.

The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, a cellular pathway for breaking down <a href="glucose">glucose</a> to produce energy. <a href="Hexokinase">Hexokinase</a> is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming <a href="glucose-6-phosphate">glucose-6-phosphate</a> from glucose. At high concentrations of <a href="fructose-6-phosphate">fructose-6-phosphate</a>, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.

In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of <a href="NF-%CE%BAB">NF-κB</a>-controlled genes, which are involved in most <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> responses, transcription is induced in response to a <a href="cell%20signaling">signal pathway</a> such as that initiated by the signaling molecule <a href="TNF-%CE%B1">TNF-α</a>, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A <a href="nuclear%20localisation%20signal">nuclear localisation signal</a> on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.

The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains <a href="intron">intron</a>s that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.

Gene expression first involves <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a>, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA), which then needs to be <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translated</a> by <a href="ribosomes">ribosomes</a> to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.

Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include <a href="helicase">helicase</a>s, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a>s, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, <a href="topoisomerase">topoisomerase</a>s, which change the amount of <a href="supercoil">supercoil</a>ing in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a>s that regulate expression.

Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as <a href="primary%20transcript">primary transcript</a>s or pre-mRNA. They must undergo <a href="post-transcriptional%20modification">post-transcriptional modification</a> in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein <a href="translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a>. The three main modifications are <a href="5%27%20cap">5' cap</a>ping, 3' <a href="polyadenylation">polyadenylation</a>, and <a href="RNA%20splicing">RNA splicing</a>. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as <a href="heterogeneous%20ribonucleoprotein%20particle">heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle</a>s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-<a href="adenine">adenine</a> tail is only added after transcription is complete.

RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the <a href="spliceosome">spliceosome</a>, is the process by which <a href="intron">intron</a>s, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining <a href="exon">exon</a>s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding <a href="antibody">antibodies</a>, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different <a href="primary%20structure">protein sequences</a>. This process is known as <a href="alternative%20splicing">alternative splicing</a>, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.

The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association <a href="karyopherin">karyopherin</a>s called <a href="importin">importin</a>s to enter the nucleus and <a href="exportin">exportin</a>s to exit. "Cargo" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as <a href="nuclear%20localization%20signal">nuclear localization signal</a>s, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry <a href="nuclear%20export%20signal">nuclear export signal</a>s bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by <a href="GTPase">GTPase</a>s, enzymes that <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyze</a> the molecule <a href="guanosine%20triphosphate">guanosine triphosphate</a> (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is <a href="Ran%20%28biology%29">Ran</a>, which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.

Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.

Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.

During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> or as a consequence of <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> (the process of <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a>). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.
In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the <a href="prophase">prophase</a> of <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called <a href="closed%20mitosis">closed mitosis</a>, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo <a href="open%20mitosis">open mitosis</a>, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.

At a certain point during the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the <a href="sister%20chromatid">sister chromatid</a>s, attaching to <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a>s, which in turn are attached to different <a href="centrosome">centrosome</a>s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in <a href="prophase">prophase</a> and until around <a href="prometaphase">prometaphase</a>, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the <a href="CDC2">CDC2 protein kinase</a>. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.

However, in <a href="dinoflagellates">dinoflagellates</a>, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., <a href="ciliate">ciliate</a>s, <a href="Apicomplexa">sporozoans</a>) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.

<a href="Apoptosis">Apoptosis</a> is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic <a href="protease">protease</a>s called <a href="caspase">caspase</a>s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in <a href="assay">assay</a>s for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.

The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as <a href="herpesvirus">herpesvirus</a> replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.

Initially, it has been suspected that <a href="immunoglobulins">immunoglobulins</a> in general and <a href="autoantibodies">autoantibodies</a> in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. <a href="lupus%20erythematosus">lupus erythematosus</a>) IgG can enter the nucleus.

Most <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, or from faulty cell division.

An anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or <a href="erythrocyte">erythrocyte</a>, which also lacks other organelles such as <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> from the <a href="lungs">lungs</a> to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through <a href="erythropoiesis">erythropoiesis</a> in the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an <a href="erythroblast">erythroblast</a> to a <a href="reticulocyte">reticulocyte</a>, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of <a href="mutagen">mutagen</a>s may induce the release of some immature "micronucleated" erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.

In <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s, this condition occurs in <a href="sieve%20tube%20element">sieve tube element</a>s.

<a href="Multinucleated">Multinucleated</a> cells contain multiple nuclei. Most <a href="acantharea">acantharea</a>n species of <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> and some <a href="fungi">fungi</a> in <a href="mycorrhizae">mycorrhizae</a> have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the <a href="intestinal%20parasite">intestinal parasite</a>s in the genus "<a href="Giardia">Giardia</a>", which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a> cells, called <a href="myocyte">myocyte</a>s and <a href="syncytium">syncytium</a>, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for <a href="myofibrils">myofibrils</a>. Other multinucleate cells in the human are <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s a type of <a href="bone%20cell">bone cell</a>. Multinucleated and <a href="binucleated%20cells">binucleated cells</a> can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of <a href="monocyte">monocyte</a>s and <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s, known as <a href="giant%20multinucleated%20cell">giant multinucleated cell</a>s, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.

A number of <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a>s are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic <a href="diatom">diatom</a>. The <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> and the <a href="plastid">plastid</a>s of the diatom somehow remain functional.

As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.

The first model known as the "syntrophic model" proposes that a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship between the <a href="archaea">archaea</a> and <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern <a href="Methanogenesis">methanogenic</a> archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern <a href="myxobacteria">myxobacteria</a>, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including <a href="histone">histone</a>s. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess <a href="kinase">kinase</a>s and <a href="G%20protein">G protein</a>s similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.

A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern <a href="planctomycetes">planctomycetes</a> bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the <a href="Eukaryote%23Relationship%20to%20Archaea">chronocyte</a>, evolved first and <a href="phagocytosed">phagocytosed</a> archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.

The most controversial model, known as "<a href="viral%20eukaryogenesis">viral eukaryogenesis</a>", posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing <a href="histone">histone</a>s to <a href="viral%20envelope">viral envelope</a>s). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a> to form an early cellular "<a href="predator">predator</a>". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early <a href="archaea">archaea</a> infected by <a href="poxvirus">poxvirus</a>es, on the basis of observed similarity between the <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>s in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the <a href="evolution%20of%20sex">evolution of sex</a> could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.

A more recent proposal, the "exomembrane hypothesis", suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as <a href="ribosome">ribosomal</a> subunits.

Claude Debussy

Achille-Claude Debussy (; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first <a href="Impressionism%20in%20music">Impressionist</a> composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Born in <a href="Saint-Germain-en-Laye">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>".

Debussy's orchestral works include "<a href="Pr%C3%A9lude%20%C3%A0%20l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi%20d%27un%20faune">Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</a>" (1894), "<a href="Nocturnes%20%28Debussy%29">Nocturnes</a>" (1897–1899) and "<a href="Images%20pour%20orchestre">Images</a>" (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical <a href="symphony">symphony</a> as obsolete and sought an alternative in his "symphonic sketches", "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>" (1903–1905). His piano works include two books of <a href="Pr%C3%A9ludes%20%28Debussy%29">Préludes</a> and two of <a href="%C3%89tudes%20%28Debussy%29">Études</a>. Throughout his career he wrote "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>s" based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the <a href="Symbolist">Symbolist</a> poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early "<a href="La%20Damoiselle%20%C3%A9lue">La Damoiselle élue</a>" and the late "<a href="Le%20Martyre%20de%20saint%20S%C3%A9bastien">Le Martyre de saint Sébastien</a>" have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.

With early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a>, <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a>, <a href="George%20Benjamin%20%28composer%29">George Benjamin</a>, and the jazz pianist and composer <a href="Bill%20Evans">Bill Evans</a>. Debussy died from <a href="colorectal%20cancer">cancer</a> at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.

Debussy was born on 22 August 1862 in <a href="Saint-Germain-en-Laye">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, <a href="Seine-et-Oise">Seine-et-Oise</a>, on the north-west fringes of Paris. He was the eldest of the five children of Manuel-Achille Debussy and his wife, Victorine, "née" Manoury. Debussy senior ran a china shop and his wife was a seamstress. The shop was unsuccessful, and closed in 1864; the family moved to Paris, first living with Victorine's mother, in <a href="Clichy%2C%20Hauts-de-Seine">Clichy</a>, and, from 1868, in their own apartment in the <a href="Rue%20Saint-Honor%C3%A9">Rue Saint-Honoré</a>. Manuel worked in a printing factory.

In 1870, to escape the <a href="Siege%20of%20Paris%20%281870%E2%80%9371%29">Siege of Paris</a> during the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, Debussy's pregnant mother took him and his sister Adéle to their paternal aunt's home in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, where they remained until the following year. During his stay in Cannes, the seven-year-old Debussy had his first piano lessons; his aunt paid for him to study with an Italian musician, Jean Cerutti. Manuel Debussy remained in Paris and joined the forces of the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Commune</a>; after its defeat by French government troops in 1871 he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, although he only served one year. Among his fellow Communard prisoners was his friend Charles de Sivry, a musician. Sivry's mother, Antoinette Mauté de Fleurville, gave piano lessons, and at his instigation the young Debussy became one of her pupils.

Debussy's talents soon became evident, and in 1872, aged ten, he was admitted to the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>, where he remained a student for the next eleven years. He first joined the piano class of <a href="Antoine%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marmontel">Antoine François Marmontel</a>, and studied <a href="solf%C3%A8ge">solfège</a> with <a href="Albert%20Lavignac">Albert Lavignac</a> and, later, composition with <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a>, harmony with <a href="%C3%89mile%20Durand">Émile Durand</a>, and organ with <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>. The course included music history and theory studies with <a href="Louis-Albert%20Bourgault-Ducoudray">Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray</a>, but it is not certain that Debussy, who was apt to skip classes, actually attended these.

At the Conservatoire, Debussy initially made good progress. Marmontel said of him "A charming child, a truly artistic temperament; much can be expected of him". Another teacher was less impressed: Emile Durand wrote in a report "Debussy would be an excellent pupil if he were less sketchy and less cavalier." A year later he described Debussy as "desperately careless". In July 1874 Debussy received the award of "deuxième accessit" for his performance as soloist in the first movement of <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Chopin's Second Piano Concerto</a> at the Conservatoire's annual competition. He was a fine pianist and an outstanding <a href="sight-reading">sight reader</a>, who could have had a professional career had he wished, but he was only intermittently diligent in his studies. He advanced to "premier accessit" in 1875 and second prize in 1877, but failed at the competitions in 1878 and 1879. These failures made him ineligible to continue in the Conservatoire's piano classes, but he remained a student for harmony, solfège and, later, composition.

With Marmontel's help Debussy secured a summer vacation job in 1879 as resident pianist at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chenonceau">Château de Chenonceau</a>, where he rapidly acquired a taste for luxury that was to remain with him all his life. His first compositions date from this period, two settings of poems by <a href="Alfred%20de%20Musset">Alfred de Musset</a>: "Ballade à la lune" and "Madrid, princesse des Espagnes". The following year he secured a job as pianist in the household of <a href="Nadezhda%20von%20Meck">Nadezhda von Meck</a>, the patroness of <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>. He travelled with her family for the summers of 1880 to 1882, staying at various places in France, Switzerland and Italy, as well as at her home in Moscow. He composed his <a href="Piano%20Trio%20%28Debussy%29">Piano Trio in G major</a> for von Meck's ensemble, and made a transcription for piano duet of three dances from Tchaikovsky's "<a href="Swan%20Lake">Swan Lake</a>".

At the end of 1880 Debussy, while continuing in his studies at the Conservatoire, was engaged as accompanist for Marie Moreau-Sainti's singing class; he took this role for four years. Among the members of the class was Marie Vasnier; Debussy was greatly taken with her, and she inspired him to compose: he wrote 27 songs dedicated to her during their seven-year relationship. She was the wife of Henri Vasnier, a prominent civil servant, and much younger than her husband. She soon became Debussy's mistress as well as his muse. Whether Vasnier was content to tolerate his wife's affair with the young student or was simply unaware of it is not clear, but he and Debussy remained on excellent terms, and he continued to encourage the composer in his career.

At the Conservatoire, Debussy incurred the disapproval of the faculty, particularly his composition teacher, Guiraud, for his failure to follow the orthodox rules of composition then prevailing. Nevertheless, in 1884 Debussy won France's most prestigious musical award, the <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>, with his <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "<a href="L%27enfant%20prodigue">L'enfant prodigue</a>". The Prix carried with it a residence at the <a href="Villa%20Medici">Villa Medici</a>, the <a href="French%20Academy%20in%20Rome">French Academy in Rome</a>, to further the winner's studies. Debussy was there from January 1885 to March 1887, with three or possibly four absences of several weeks when he returned to France, chiefly to see Marie Vasnier.

Initially Debussy found the artistic atmosphere of the Villa Medici stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the accommodation "abominable". Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Donizetti</a> and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> not to his taste. He was much more impressed by the music of the 16th-century composers <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a> and <a href="Orlande%20de%20Lassus">Lassus</a>, which he heard at <a href="Santa%20Maria%20dell%27Anima">Santa Maria dell'Anima</a>: "The only church music I will accept." He was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, who visited the students and played for them. In June 1885, Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, "I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!"

Debussy finally composed four pieces that were submitted to the Academy: the symphonic ode "Zuleima" (based on a text by <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>); the orchestral piece "Printemps"; the cantata "<a href="La%20Damoiselle%20%C3%A9lue">La Damoiselle élue</a>" (1887–1888), the first piece in which the stylistic features of his later music began to emerge; and the "Fantaisie" for piano and orchestra, which was heavily based on Franck's music and was eventually withdrawn by Debussy. The Academy chided him for writing music that was "bizarre, incomprehensible and unperformable". Although Debussy's works showed the influence of <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Jules Massenet</a>, the latter concluded, "He is an enigma." During his years in Rome Debussy composed – not for the Academy – most of his <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Verlaine</a> cycle, "<a href="Ariettes%20oubli%C3%A9es">Ariettes oubliées</a>", which made little impact at the time but was successfully republished in 1903 after the composer had become well known.

A week after his return to Paris in 1887, Debussy heard the first act of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" at the <a href="Concerts%20Lamoureux">Concerts Lamoureux</a>, and judged it "decidedly the finest thing I know". In 1888 and 1889 he went to the annual festivals of Wagner's operas at <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a>. He responded positively to Wagner's sensuousness, mastery of form, and striking harmonies, and was briefly influenced by them, but, unlike some other French composers of his generation, he concluded that there was no future in attempting to adopt and develop Wagner's style. He commented in 1903 that Wagner was "a beautiful sunset that was mistaken for a dawn".
In 1889, at the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281889%29">Paris Exposition Universelle</a>, Debussy first heard <a href="Java">Java</a>nese <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> music. The gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, and ensemble textures appealed to him, and echoes of them are heard in "Pagodes" in his piano suite "<a href="Estampes">Estampes</a>". He also attended two concerts of <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>'s music, conducted by the composer. This too made an impression on him, and its harmonic freedom and non-Teutonic tone colours influenced his own developing musical style.

Marie Vasnier ended her liaison with Debussy soon after his final return from Rome, although they remained on good enough terms for him to dedicate to her one more song, "Mandoline", in 1890. Later in 1890 Debussy met <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition. Both were bohemians, enjoying the same café society and struggling to stay afloat financially. In the same year Debussy began a relationship with Gabrielle (Gaby) Dupont, a tailor's daughter from <a href="Lisieux">Lisieux</a>; in July 1893 they began living together.

Debussy continued to compose songs, piano pieces and other works, some of which were publicly performed, but his music made only a modest impact, although his fellow composers recognised his potential by electing him to the committee of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a> in 1893. His <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Debussy%29">String Quartet</a> was premiered by the <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ysa%C3%BFe">Ysaÿe</a> string quartet at the Société Nationale in the same year. In May 1893 Debussy attended a theatrical event that was of key importance to his later career – the premiere of <a href="Maurice%20Maeterlinck">Maurice Maeterlinck</a>'s play "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>", which he immediately determined to turn into an opera. He travelled to Maeterlinck's home in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> in November to secure his consent to an operatic adaptation.

In February 1894 Debussy completed the first draft of Act I of his <a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">operatic version</a> of "Pelléas et Mélisande", and worked to complete the work for most of the year. While still living with Dupont, he had an affair with the singer Thérèse Roger, and in 1894 he announced their engagement. His behaviour was widely condemned; anonymous letters circulated denouncing his treatment of both women, as well as his financial irresponsibility and debts. The engagement was broken off, and several of Debussy's friends and supporters disowned him, including <a href="Ernest%20Chausson">Ernest Chausson</a>, hitherto one of his strongest supporters.

In terms of musical recognition, Debussy made a step forward in December 1894, when the <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> "<a href="Pr%C3%A9lude%20%C3%A0%20l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi%20d%27un%20faune">Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</a>", based on <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Stéphane Mallarmé</a>'s poem, was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale. The following year he completed the first draft of "Pelléas" and began efforts to get it staged. In May 1898 he made his first contacts with <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a> and <a href="Albert%20Carr%C3%A9">Albert Carré</a>, respectively the musical director and general manager of the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, Paris, about presenting the opera.
Debussy abandoned Dupont for her friend Marie-Rosalie Texier, known as "Lilly", whom he married in October 1899, after threatening suicide if she refused him. She was affectionate, practical, straightforward, and well liked by Debussy's friends and associates, but he became increasingly irritated by her intellectual limitations and lack of musical sensitivity. The marriage lasted barely five years.

In 1900 Debussy began attending meetings of <a href="Les%20Apaches">Les Apaches</a> ("The Hooligans") an informal group of innovative young artists, poets, critics, and musicians who had adopted their collective title to represent their status as "artistic outcasts". The membership was fluid, but at various times included <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, <a href="Ricardo%20Vi%C3%B1es">Ricardo Viñes</a>, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Manuel%20de%20Falla">Manuel de Falla</a>. In the same year the first two of Debussy's three orchestral "<a href="Nocturnes%20%28Debussy%29">Nocturnes</a>" were first performed. Although they did not make any great impact with the public they were well reviewed by musicians including <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Paul Dukas</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Bruneau">Alfred Bruneau</a> and <a href="Pierre%20de%20Br%C3%A9ville">Pierre de Bréville</a>. The complete set was given the following year.

Like many other composers of the time, Debussy supplemented his income by teaching and writing. For most of 1901 he had a sideline as music critic of "<a href="La%20Revue%20Blanche">La Revue Blanche</a>", adopting the pen name "Monsieur Croche". He expressed trenchant views on composers ("I hate sentimentality – his name is Camille Saint-Saëns"), institutions (on the Paris Opéra: "A stranger would take it for a railway station, and, once inside, would mistake it for a Turkish bath"), conductors ("Nikisch is a unique virtuoso, so much so that his virtuosity seems to make him forget the claims of good taste"), musical politics ("The English actually think that a musician can manage an opera house successfully!"), and audiences ("their almost drugged expression of boredom, indifference and even stupidity"). He later collected his criticisms with a view to their publication as a book; it was published after his death as "Monsieur Croche, Antidilettante".

In January 1902 rehearsals began at the Opéra-Comique for the opening of "Pelléas et Mélisande". For three months, Debussy attended rehearsals practically every day. In February there was conflict between Maeterlinck on the one hand and Debussy, Messager and Carré on the other about the casting of Mélisande. Maeterlinck wanted his mistress, <a href="Georgette%20Leblanc">Georgette Leblanc</a>, to sing the role, and was incensed when she was passed over in favour of the Scottish soprano <a href="Mary%20Garden">Mary Garden</a>. The opera opened on 30 April 1902, and although the first-night audience was divided between admirers and sceptics, the work quickly became a success. It made Debussy a well-known name in France and abroad; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented that the opera had "provoked more discussion than any work of modern times, excepting, of course, those of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>". The Apaches, led by Ravel (who attended every one of the 14 performances in the first run), were loud in their support; the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire tried in vain to stop its students from seeing the opera. The vocal score was published in early May, and the full orchestral score in 1904.

In 1903 there was public recognition of Debussy's stature when he was appointed a Chevalier of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>, but his social standing suffered a great blow when another turn in his private life caused a scandal the following year. Among his pupils was Raoul Bardac, son of <a href="Emma%20Bardac">Emma</a>, the wife of a Parisian banker, Sigismond Bardac. Raoul introduced his teacher to his mother, to whom Debussy quickly became greatly attracted. She was a sophisticate, a brilliant conversationalist, an accomplished singer, and relaxed about marital fidelity, having been the mistress and muse of <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a> a few years earlier. After despatching Lilly to her parental home at Bichain in <a href="Villeneuve-la-Guyard">Villeneuve-la-Guyard</a> on 15 July 1904, Debussy took Emma away, staying incognito in <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a> and then at <a href="Pourville">Pourville</a> in Normandy. He wrote to his wife on 11 August from <a href="Dieppe">Dieppe</a>, telling her that their marriage was over, but still making no mention of Bardac. When he returned to Paris he set up home on his own, taking a flat in a different <a href="arrondissement">arrondissement</a>. On 14 October, five days before their fifth wedding anniversary, Lilly Debussy attempted suicide, shooting herself in the chest with a revolver; she survived, although the bullet remained lodged in her <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e for the rest of her life. The ensuing scandal caused Bardac's family to disown her, and Debussy lost many good friends including Dukas and Messager. His relations with Ravel, never close, were exacerbated when the latter joined other former friends of Debussy in contributing to a fund to support the deserted Lilly.

The Bardacs divorced in May 1905. Finding the hostility in Paris intolerable, Debussy and Emma (now pregnant) went to England. They stayed at the <a href="Grand%20Hotel%2C%20Eastbourne">Grand Hotel, Eastbourne</a> in July and August, where Debussy corrected the proofs of his symphonic sketches" <a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>", celebrating his divorce on 2 August. After a brief visit to London, the couple returned to Paris in September, buying a house in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now <a href="Avenue%20Foch">Avenue Foch</a>), Debussy's home for the rest of his life.
In October 1905 "La mer", Debussy's most substantial orchestral work, was premiered in Paris by the <a href="Orchestre%20Lamoureux">Orchestre Lamoureux</a> under the direction of <a href="Camille%20Chevillard">Camille Chevillard</a>; the reception was mixed. Some praised the work, but <a href="Pierre%20Lalo">Pierre Lalo</a>, critic of "<a href="Le%20Temps">Le Temps</a>", hitherto an admirer of Debussy, wrote, "I do not hear, I do not see, I do not smell the sea". In the same month the composer's only child was born at their home. Claude-Emma, affectionately known as "Chouchou", was a musical inspiration to the composer (she was the dedicatee of his "<a href="Children%27s%20Corner">Children's Corner</a>" suite). She outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> epidemic of 1919. Mary Garden said, "I honestly don't know if Debussy ever loved anybody really. He loved his music – and perhaps himself. I think he was wrapped up in his genius", but biographers are agreed that whatever his relations with lovers and friends, Debussy was devoted to his daughter.

Debussy and Emma Bardac eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring for the rest of his life. The following year began well, when at Fauré's invitation, Debussy became a member of the governing council of the Conservatoire. His success in London was consolidated in April 1909, when he conducted "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune" and the "Nocturnes" at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>; in May he was present at the first London production of "Pelléas et Mélisande", at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a>. In the same year, Debussy was diagnosed with <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, from which he was to die nine years later.

Debussy's works began to feature increasingly in concert programmes at home and overseas. In 1910 <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> conducted the "Nocturnes" and "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune" in New York in successive months. In the same year, visiting Budapest, Debussy commented that his works were better known there than in Paris. In 1912 <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a> commissioned a new ballet score, "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>". That, and the three "<a href="Images%20pour%20orchestre">Images</a>", premiered the following year, were the composer's last orchestral works. "Jeux" was unfortunate in its timing: two weeks after the premiere, in March 1913, Diaghilev presented the first performance of Stravinsky's "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>", a sensational event that monopolised discussion in musical circles, and effectively sidelined "Jeux" along with Fauré's "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>", which had opened a week before.
In 1915 Debussy underwent one of the earliest <a href="colostomy">colostomy</a> operations. It achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration ("There are mornings when the effort of dressing seems like one of the twelve labours of Hercules"). He also had a fierce enemy at this period in the form of <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, who in a letter to Fauré condemned Debussy's "En blanc et noir": "It's incredible, and the door of the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut [de France</a>] must at all costs be barred against a man capable of such atrocities." Saint-Saëns had been a member of the Institut since 1881: Debussy never became one. His health continued to decline; he gave his final concert (the premiere of his Violin Sonata) on 14 September 1917 and became bedridden in early 1918.

Debussy died on 25 March 1918 at his home. The First World War was still raging and Paris was under German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">aerial and artillery bombardment</a>. The military situation did not permit the honour of a public funeral with ceremonious graveside orations. The funeral procession made its way through deserted streets to a temporary grave at <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a> as the <a href="Paris%20Gun">German guns</a> bombarded the city. Debussy's body was reinterred the following year in the small <a href="Passy%20Cemetery">Passy Cemetery</a> sequestered behind the <a href="Trocad%C3%A9ro">Trocadéro</a>, fulfilling his wish to rest "among the trees and the birds"; his wife and daughter are buried with him.

In a survey of Debussy's oeuvre shortly after the composer's death, the critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> wrote, "It would be hardly too much to say that Debussy spent a third of his life in the discovery of himself, a third in the free and happy realisation of himself, and the final third in the partial, painful loss of himself". Later commentators have rated some of the late works more highly than Newman and other contemporaries did, but much of the music for which Debussy is best known is from the middle years of his career.

The analyst David Cox wrote in 1974 that Debussy, admiring Wagner's attempts to combine all the creative arts, "created a new, instinctive, dreamlike world of music, lyrical and pantheistic, contemplative and objective – a kind of art, in fact, which seemed to reach out into all aspects of experience." In 1988 the composer and scholar <a href="Wilfrid%20Mellers">Wilfrid Mellers</a> wrote of Debussy:

Debussy did not give his works <a href="opus%20number">opus number</a>s, apart from his String Quartet op. 10 in G minor (also the only work where the composer's title included a <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a>). His works were catalogued and indexed by the musicologist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lesure">François Lesure</a> in 1977 (revised in 2003) and their <a href="List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Claude%20Debussy%20by%20Lesure%20number">Lesure number</a> ("L" followed by a number) is sometimes used as a suffix to their title in concert programmes and recordings.

Debussy's musical development was slow, and as a student he was adept enough to produce for his teachers at the Conservatoire works that would conform to their conservative precepts. His friend <a href="Georges%20Jean-Aubry">Georges Jean-Aubry</a> commented that Debussy "admirably imitated Massenet's melodic turns of phrase" in the cantata "<a href="L%27enfant%20prodigue">L'enfant prodigue</a>" (1884) which won him the Prix de Rome. A more characteristically Debussian work from his early years is "<a href="La%20Damoiselle%20%C3%A9lue">La Damoiselle élue</a>", recasting the traditional form for <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s and cantatas, using a chamber orchestra and a small body of choral tone and using new or long-neglected scales and harmonies. His early "<a href="m%C3%A9lodie">mélodie</a>s", inspired by Marie Vasnier, are more virtuosic in character than his later works in the genre, with extensive wordless "<a href="vocalise">vocalise</a>"; from the "<a href="Ariettes%20oubli%C3%A9es">Ariettes oubliées</a>" (1885–1887) onwards he developed a more restrained style. He wrote his own poems for the "Proses lyriques" (1892–1893) but, in the view of the musical scholar <a href="Robert%20Orledge">Robert Orledge</a>, "his literary talents were not on a par with his musical imagination".

The musicologist <a href="Jacques-Gabriel%20Prod%27homme">Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme</a> wrote that together with "La Demoiselle élue", the "Ariettes oubliées" and the "<a href="Cinq%20po%C3%A8mes%20de%20Charles%20Baudelaire">Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire</a>" (1889) show "the new, strange way which the young musician will hereafter follow". Newman concurred: "There is a good deal of Wagner, especially of "Tristan", in the idiom. But the work as a whole is distinctive, and the first in which we get a hint of the Debussy we were to know later – the lover of vague outlines, of half-lights, of mysterious consonances and dissonances of colour, the apostle of languor, the exclusivist in thought and in style." During the next few years Debussy developed his personal style, without, at this stage, breaking sharply away from French musical traditions. Much of his music from this period is on a small scale, such as the "<a href="Deux%20arabesques">Deux arabesques</a>", "<a href="Valse%20romantique">Valse romantique</a>", "<a href="Suite%20bergamasque">Suite bergamasque</a>", and the first set of "<a href="F%C3%AAtes%20galantes%20%28Debussy%29">Fêtes galantes</a>". Newman remarked that like <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, the Debussy of this period appears as a liberator from Germanic styles of composition – offering instead "an exquisite, pellucid style" capable of conveying "not only gaiety and whimsicality but emotion of a deeper sort". In a 2004 study, Mark DeVoto comments that Debussy's early works are harmonically no more adventurous than existing music by Fauré; in a 2007 book about the piano works, Margery Halford observes that "Deux arabesques" (1888–1891) and "Rêverie" (1890) have "the fluidity and warmth of Debussy's later style" but are not harmonically innovative. Halford cites the popular <a href="Debussy%27s%20Claire%20de%20Lune">"Clair de Lune"</a> (1890) from the "Suite Bergamasque" as a transitional work pointing towards the composer's mature style.

Musicians from Debussy's time onwards have regarded "<a href="Pr%C3%A9lude%20%C3%A0%20l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi%20d%27un%20faune">Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</a>" (1894) as his first orchestral masterpiece. Newman considered it "completely original in idea, absolutely personal in style, and logical and coherent from first to last, without a superfluous bar or even a superfluous note"; <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> observed, "Modern music was awakened by "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune"". Most of the major works for which Debussy is best known were written between the mid-1890s and the mid-1900s. They include the <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Debussy%29">String Quartet</a> (1893), "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" (1893–1902), the "<a href="Nocturnes%20%28Debussy%29">Nocturnes for Orchestra</a>" (1899) and "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>" (1903–1905). The suite "<a href="Pour%20le%20piano">Pour le piano</a>" (1894–1901) is, in Halford's view, one of the first examples of the mature Debussy as a composer for the piano: "a major landmark ... and an enlargement of the use of piano sonorities".

In the String Quartet (1893), the gamelan sonorities Debussy had heard four years earlier are recalled in the <a href="pizzicato">pizzicato</a>s and <a href="Cross-beat">cross-rhythms</a> of the <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a>. Debussy's biographer <a href="Edward%20Lockspeiser">Edward Lockspeiser</a> comments that this movement shows the composer's rejection of "the traditional dictum that string instruments should be predominantly lyrical". The work influenced Ravel, whose own <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Ravel%29">String Quartet</a>, written ten years later, has noticeably Debussian features. The academic and journalist Stephen Walsh calls "Pelléas et Mélisande" (begun 1893, staged 1902) "a key work for the 20th century". The composer <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a> was fascinated by its "extraordinary harmonic qualities and ... transparent instrumental texture". The opera is composed in what <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a> describes as a sustained and heightened <a href="recitative">recitative</a> style, with "sensuous, intimate" vocal lines. It influenced composers as different as <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a>.

Orledge describes the "Nocturnes" as exceptionally varied in texture, "ranging from the Musorgskian start of 'Nuages', through the approaching brass band procession in 'Fêtes', to the wordless female chorus in 'Sirènes. Orledge considers the last a pre-echo of the marine textures of "La mer". "<a href="Estampes">Estampes</a>" for piano (1903) gives impressions of exotic locations, with further echoes of the gamelan in its <a href="pentatonic">pentatonic</a> structures. Debussy believed that since Beethoven, the traditional symphonic form had become formulaic, repetitive and obsolete. The three-part, cyclic <a href="Symphony%20in%20D%20minor%20%28Franck%29">symphony by César Franck</a> (1888) was more to his liking, and its influence can be found in "La mer" (1905); this uses a quasi-symphonic form, its three sections making up a giant <a href="sonata-form">sonata-form</a> movement with, as Orledge observes, a cyclic theme, in the manner of Franck. The central "Jeux de vagues" section has the function of a symphonic <a href="Musical%20development">development section</a> leading into the final "Dialogue du vent et de la mer", "a powerful essay in orchestral colour and sonority" (Orledge) which reworks themes from the first movement. The reviews were sharply divided. Some critics thought the treatment less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works, and even a step backward; others praised its "power and charm", its "extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy", and its strong colours and definite lines.

Of the later orchestral works, "<a href="Images%20%28Debussy%29">Images</a>" (1905–1912) is better known and more often played than "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>" (1913). The former follows the tripartite form established in the "Nocturnes" and "La mer", but differs in employing traditional British and French folk tunes, and in making the central movement, "Ibéria", far longer than the outer ones, and subdividing it into three parts, all inspired by scenes from Spanish life. Although considering "Images" "the pinnacle of Debussy's achievement as a composer for orchestra", Trezise notes a contrary view that the accolade belongs to the ballet score "Jeux". The latter failed as a ballet because of what Jann Pasler describes as a banal scenario, and the score was neglected for some years. Recent analysts have found it a link between traditional continuity and thematic growth within a score and the desire to create discontinuity in a way mirrored in later 20th century music. In this piece, Debussy abandoned the <a href="whole-tone">whole-tone</a> scale he had often favoured previously in favour of the <a href="octatonic%20scale">octatonic scale</a> with what the Debussy scholar <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lesure">François Lesure</a> describes as its tonal ambiguities.

Among the late piano works are two books of "<a href="Pr%C3%A9ludes%20%28Debussy%29">Préludes</a>" (1909–10, 1911–13), short pieces that depict a wide range of subjects. Lesure comments that they range from the frolics of minstrels at Eastbourne in 1905 and the American acrobat "General Lavine" "to dead leaves and the sounds and scents of the evening air". "<a href="En%20blanc%20et%20noir">En blanc et noir</a>" (In white and black, 1915), a three-movement work for two pianos, is a predominantly sombre piece, reflecting the war and national danger. The "<a href="%C3%89tudes%20%28Debussy%29">Études</a>" (1915) for piano have divided opinion. Writing soon after Debussy's death, Newman found them laboured – "a strange last chapter in a great artist's life"; Lesure, writing eighty years later rates them among Debussy's greatest late works: "Behind a pedagogic exterior, these 12 pieces explore abstract intervals, or – in the last five – the sonorities and timbres peculiar to the piano." In 1914 Debussy started work on a planned set of <a href="Six%20sonatas%20for%20various%20instruments">six sonatas</a> for various instruments. His fatal illness prevented him from completing the set, but those for cello and piano (1915), flute, viola and harp (1915), and violin and piano (1917 – his last completed work) are all concise, three-movement pieces, more <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> in nature than some of his other late works.

"<a href="Le%20Martyre%20de%20saint%20S%C3%A9bastien">Le Martyre de saint Sébastien</a>" (1911), originally a five-act musical play to a text by <a href="Gabriele%20D%27Annunzio">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a> that took nearly five hours in performance, was not a success, and the music is now more often heard in a concert (or studio) adaptation with narrator, or as an orchestral suite of "Fragments symphoniques". Debussy enlisted the help of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Caplet">André Caplet</a> in orchestrating and arranging the score. Two late stage works, the ballets "<a href="Khamma%20%28ballet%29">Khamma</a>" (1912) and "<a href="La%20bo%C3%AEte%20%C3%A0%20joujoux">La boîte à joujoux</a>" (1913), were left with the orchestration incomplete, and were completed by <a href="Charles%20Koechlin">Charles Koechlin</a> and Caplet, respectively.

The application of the term "Impressionist" to Debussy and the music he influenced has been much debated, both in the composer's lifetime and subsequently. The analyst <a href="Richard%20Langham%20Smith">Richard Langham Smith</a> writes that Impressionism was originally a term coined to describe a <a href="Impressionism">style of late 19th-century French painting</a>, typically scenes suffused with reflected light in which the emphasis is on the overall impression rather than outline or clarity of detail, as in works by <a href="Claude%20Monet">Monet</a>, <a href="Camille%20Pissarro">Pissarro</a>, <a href="Pierre-Auguste%20Renoir">Renoir</a> and others. Langham Smith writes that the term became transferred to the compositions of Debussy and others which were "concerned with the representation of landscape or natural phenomena, particularly the water and light imagery dear to Impressionists, through subtle textures suffused with instrumental colour".

Among painters, Debussy particularly admired <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">Turner</a>, but also drew inspiration from <a href="James%20Abbott%20McNeill%20Whistler">Whistler</a>. With the latter in mind the composer wrote to the violinist <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ysa%C3%BFe">Eugène Ysaÿe</a> in 1894 describing the orchestral "Nocturnes" as "an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one colour – what a study in grey would be in painting."

Debussy strongly objected to the use of the word "Impressionism" for his (or anybody else's) music, but it has continually been attached to him since the assessors at the Conservatoire first applied it, opprobriously, to his early work "Printemps". Langham Smith comments that Debussy wrote many piano pieces with titles evocative of nature – "Reflets dans l'eau" (1905), "Les Sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir" (1910) and "Brouillards" (1913) – and suggests that the Impressionist painters' use of brush-strokes and dots is paralleled in the music of Debussy. Although Debussy said that anyone using the term (whether about painting or music) was an imbecile, some Debussy scholars have taken a less absolutist line. Lockspeiser calls "La mer" "the greatest example of an orchestral Impressionist work", and more recently in "The Cambridge Companion to Debussy" Nigel Simeone comments, "It does not seem unduly far-fetched to see a parallel in Monet's seascapes".

In this context may be placed Debussy's <a href="pantheism">pantheistic</a> eulogy to Nature, in a 1911 interview with <a href="Henry%20Malherbe">Henry Malherbe</a>:
In contrast to the "impressionistic" characterisation of Debussy's music, several writers have suggested that he structured at least some of his music on rigorous mathematical lines. In 1983 the pianist and scholar <a href="Roy%20Howat">Roy Howat</a> published a book contending that certain of Debussy's works are proportioned using mathematical models, even while using an apparent classical structure such as <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>. Howat suggests that some of Debussy's pieces can be divided into sections that reflect the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a>, which is approximated by ratios of consecutive numbers in the <a href="Fibonacci%20sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a>. Simon Trezise, in his 1994 book "Debussy: La Mer", finds the intrinsic evidence "remarkable," with the caveat that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy deliberately sought such proportions. Lesure takes a similar view, endorsing Howat's conclusions while not taking a view on Debussy's conscious intentions.

 Debussy wrote "We must agree that the beauty of a work of art will always remain a mystery [...] we can never be absolutely sure "how it's made". We must at all costs preserve this magic which is peculiar to music and to which music, by its nature, is of all the arts the most receptive".

Nevertheless, there are many indicators of the sources and elements of Debussy's idiom. Writing in 1958, the critic <a href="Rudolph%20Reti">Rudolph Reti</a> summarised six features of Debussy's music, which he asserted "established a new concept of tonality in European music": the frequent use of lengthy <a href="pedal%20point">pedal point</a>s – "not merely bass pedals in the actual sense of the term, but sustained 'pedals' in any voice"; glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality; frequent use of <a href="parallel%20chord">parallel chord</a>s which are "in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons", described by some writers as non-functional harmonies; bitonality, or at least <a href="bitonal">bitonal</a> chords; use of the <a href="Whole%20tone%20scale">whole-tone</a> and <a href="pentatonic%20scale">pentatonic scale</a>s; and <a href="unprepared%20modulation">unprepared modulation</a>s, "without any harmonic bridge". Reti concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based "melodic tonality" with harmonies, albeit different from those of "harmonic tonality".

In 1889, Debussy held conversations with his former teacher Guiraud, which included exploration of harmonic possibilities at the piano. The discussion, and Debussy's chordal keyboard improvisations, were noted by a younger pupil of Guiraud, Maurice Emmanuel. The chord sequences played by Debussy include some of the elements identified by Reti. They may also indicate the influence on Debussy of <a href="Erik%20Satie">Satie</a>'s 1887 "<a href="Sarabandes%20%28Satie%29">Trois Sarabandes</a>". A further improvisation by Debussy during this conversation included a sequence of whole tone harmonies which may have been inspired by the music of <a href="Mikhail%20Glinka">Glinka</a> or <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a> which was becoming known in Paris at this time. During the conversation, Debussy told Guiraud, "There is no theory. You have only to listen. Pleasure is the law!" – although he also conceded, "I feel free because I have been through the mill, and I don't write in the <a href="fugue">fugal</a> style because I know it."

Among French predecessors, <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Chabrier</a> was an important influence on Debussy (as he was on Ravel and <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Poulenc</a>); Howat has written that Chabrier's piano music such as "Sous-bois" and "Mauresque" in the "<a href="Pi%C3%A8ces%20pittoresques">Pièces pittoresques</a>" explored new sound-worlds of which Debussy made effective use 30 years later. Lesure finds traces of <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a> and <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a> in some of Debussy's early songs, and remarks that it may have been from the Russians – <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="Mily%20Balakirev">Balakirev</a>, <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Borodin</a> and <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</a> – that Debussy acquired his taste for "ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules". Lesure also considers that Mussorgsky's opera "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>" directly influenced Debussy's "Pelléas et Mélisande". In the music of <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a>, Debussy found what he called "a perfect whiteness", and he felt that although Palestrina's musical forms had a "strict manner", they were more to his taste than the rigid rules prevailing among 19th-century French composers and teachers. He drew inspiration from what he called Palestrina's "harmony created by melody", finding an <a href="arabesque">arabesque</a>-like quality in the melodic lines.

Debussy opined that <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a> was "the greatest of them all, for through the piano he discovered everything"; he professed his "respectful gratitude" for Chopin's piano music. He was torn between dedicating his own Études to Chopin or to <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Couperin">François Couperin</a>, whom he also admired as a model of form, seeing himself as heir to their mastery of the genre. Howat cautions against the assumption that Debussy's Ballade (1891) and Nocturne (1892) are influenced by Chopin – in Howat's view they owe more to Debussy's early Russian models – but Chopin's influence is found in other early works such as the "Deux arabesques" (1889–1891). In 1914 the publisher <a href="Durand%20%28publisher%29">A. Durand & fils</a> began publishing scholarly new editions of the works of major composers, and Debussy undertook the supervision of the editing of Chopin's music.

Although Debussy was in no doubt of Wagner's stature, he was only briefly influenced by him in his compositions, after "La damoiselle élue" and the "Cinq poèmes de Baudelaire" (both begun in 1887). According to <a href="Pierre%20Lou%C3%BFs">Pierre Louÿs</a>, Debussy "did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan'," although he admitted that it was sometimes difficult to avoid "the ghost of old <a href="Parsifal%23Act%202">Klingsor</a>, alias Richard Wagner, appearing at the turning of a bar". After Debussy's short Wagnerian phase, he started to become interested in non-Western music and its unfamiliar approaches to composition. The piano piece "<a href="Golliwogg%27s%20Cakewalk">Golliwogg's Cakewalk</a>", from the 1908 suite "<a href="Children%27s%20Corner">Children's Corner</a>", contains a parody of music from the introduction to "Tristan", in which, in the opinion of the musicologist <a href="Lawrence%20Kramer%20%28musicologist%29">Lawrence Kramer</a>, Debussy escapes the shadow of the older composer and "smilingly relativizes Wagner into insignificance".

A contemporary influence was Erik Satie, according to Nichols Debussy's "most faithful friend" amongst French musicians. Debussy's orchestration in 1896 of Satie's "<a href="Gymnop%C3%A9dies">Gymnopédies</a>" (which had been written in 1887) "put their composer on the map" according to the musicologist <a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a>, and the Sarabande from Debussy's "Pour le piano" (1901) "shows that [Debussy] knew Satie's "<a href="Sarabandes%20%28Satie%29">Trois Sarabandes</a>" at a time when only a personal friend of the composer could have known them." (They were not published until 1911). Debussy's interest in the popular music of his time is evidenced not only by the "Golliwogg's Cakewalk" and other piano pieces featuring <a href="rag-time">rag-time</a>, such as "<a href="The%20Little%20Nigar">The Little Nigar</a>" (Debussy's spelling) (1909), but by the slow <a href="waltz">waltz</a> "<a href="La%20plus%20que%20lente">La plus que lente</a>" ("The more than slow"), based on the style of the gipsy violinist at a Paris hotel (to whom he gave the manuscript of the piece).

In addition to the composers who influenced his own compositions, Debussy held strong views about several others. He was for the most part enthusiastic about <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> and Stravinsky, respectful of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and was in awe of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, whom he called the "good God of music" ("le Bon Dieu de la musique"). His relationship to Beethoven was complex; he was said to refer to him as "le vieux sourd" (the old deaf one) and asked one young pupil not to play Beethoven's music for "it is like somebody dancing on my grave;" but he believed that Beethoven had profound things to say, yet did not know how to say them, "because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness." He was not in sympathy with <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, the latter being described as a "facile and elegant notary".

With the advent of the First World War, Debussy became ardently patriotic in his musical opinions. Writing to Stravinsky, he asked "How could we not have foreseen that these men were plotting the destruction of our art, just as they had planned the destruction of our country?" In 1915 he complained that "since <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a> we have had no purely French tradition [...] We tolerated overblown orchestras, tortuous forms [...] we were about to give the seal of approval to even more suspect naturalizations when the sound of gunfire put a sudden stop to it all." Taruskin writes that some have seen this as a reference to the composers <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>, both born Jewish. In 1912 Debussy had remarked to his publisher of the opera "<a href="Ariane%20et%20Barbe-bleue">Ariane et Barbe-bleue</a>" by the (also Jewish) composer <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Paul Dukas</a>, "You're right, [it] is a masterpiece – but it's not a masterpiece of French music."

Despite his lack of formal schooling, Debussy read widely and found inspiration in literature. Lesure writes, "The development of <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced him to think about issues of musical form." Debussy was influenced by the <a href="Symbolist">Symbolist</a> poets. These writers, who included Verlaine, Mallarmé, Maeterlinck and <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Rimbaud</a>, reacted against the realism, naturalism, objectivity and formal conservatism that prevailed in the 1870s. They favoured poetry using suggestion rather than direct statement; the literary scholar Chris Baldrick writes that they evoked "subjective moods through the use of private symbols, while avoiding the description of external reality or the expression of opinion". Debussy was much in sympathy with the Symbolists' desire to bring poetry closer to music, became friendly with several leading exponents, and set many Symbolist works throughout his career.

Debussy's literary inspirations were mostly French, but he did not overlook foreign writers. As well as Maeterlinck for "Pelléas et Mélisande", he drew on <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> for two of his Préludes for piano – "La Danse de Puck" (Book 1, 1910) and "<a href="Hommage%20%C3%A0%20S.%20Pickwick%20Esq.%20P.P.M.P.C.">Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.</a>" (Book 2, 1913). He set <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>'s "<a href="The%20Blessed%20Damozel">The Blessed Damozel</a>" in his early cantata, "La Damoiselle élue" (1888). He wrote incidental music for "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" and planned an opera based on "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", but abandoned that once he turned his attention to setting Maeterlinck's play. In 1890 he began work on an orchestral piece inspired by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Usher">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>" and later sketched the libretto for an opera, "<a href="La%20chute%20de%20la%20maison%20Usher%20%28opera%29">La chute de la maison Usher</a>". Another project inspired by Poe – an operatic version of "<a href="The%20Devil%20in%20the%20Belfry">The Devil in the Belfry</a>" did not progress beyond sketches. French writers whose words he set include <a href="Paul%20Bourget">Paul Bourget</a>, <a href="Alfred%20de%20Musset">Alfred de Musset</a>, <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20de%20Banville">Théodore de Banville</a>, <a href="Leconte%20de%20Lisle">Leconte de Lisle</a>, <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a>, <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Villon">François Villon</a>, and Mallarmé – the last of whom also provided Debussy with the inspiration for one of his most popular orchestral pieces, "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune".

Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. <a href="Roger%20Nichols%20%28musical%20scholar%29">Roger Nichols</a> writes that "if one omits Schoenberg [...] a list of 20th-century composers influenced by Debussy is practically a list of 20th-century composers "<a href="wikt%3Atout%20court">tout court</a>"."

<a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a> first encountered Debussy's music in 1907 and later said that "Debussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities". Not only Debussy's use of whole-tone scales, but also his style of word-setting in "Pelléas et Mélisande", were the subject of study by <a href="Leo%C5%A1%20Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek">Leoš Janáček</a> while he was writing his 1921 opera "<a href="K%C3%A1%C5%A5a%20Kabanov%C3%A1">Káťa Kabanová</a>". <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> was more ambivalent about Debussy's music (he thought "Pelléas" "a terrible bore...in spite of many wonderful pages") but the two composers knew each other and Stravinsky's "<a href="Symphonies%20of%20Wind%20Instruments">Symphonies d'instruments à vent</a>" (1920) was written as a memorial for Debussy.

In the aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20I">the Great War</a>, the young French composers of <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a> reacted against what they saw as the poetic, mystical quality of Debussy's music in favour of something more hard-edged. Their sympathiser and self-appointed spokesman, <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a> wrote in 1918: "Enough of "nuages", waves, aquariums, "ondines" and nocturnal perfumes," pointedly alluding to the titles of pieces by Debussy. Later generations of French composers had a much more positive relationship with his music. <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Messiaen</a> was given a score of "Pelléas et Mélisande" as a boy and said that it was "a revelation, love at first sight" and "probably the most decisive influence I have been subject to". <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Boulez</a> also discovered Debussy's music at a young age and said that it gave him his first sense of what modernity in music could mean.

Among contemporary composers <a href="George%20Benjamin%20%28composer%29">George Benjamin</a> has described "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune" as “the definition of perfection”; he has conducted "Pelléas et Mélisande" and the critic Rupert Christiansen detects the influence of the work in Benjamin's opera "<a href="Written%20on%20Skin">Written on Skin</a>" (2012). Others have made orchestrations of some of the piano and vocal works, including <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a>'s version of four of the Baudelaire songs ("Le Livre de Baudelaire", 1994), <a href="Robin%20Holloway">Robin Holloway</a>'s of "En blanc et noir" (2002), and <a href="Colin%20Matthews">Colin Matthews</a>'s of both books of "Préludes" (2001–2006).

The pianist <a href="Stephen%20Hough">Stephen Hough</a> believes that Debussy's influence also extends to jazz and suggests that "<a href="Reflets%20dans%20l%27eau">Reflets dans l'eau</a>" can be heard in the harmonies of <a href="Bill%20Evans">Bill Evans</a>.

In 1904, Debussy played the piano accompaniment for Mary Garden in recordings for the Compagnie française du Gramophone of four of his songs: three "mélodies" from the Verlaine cycle "Ariettes oubliées" – "Il pleure dans mon coeur", "L'ombre des arbres" and "Green" – and "Mes longs cheveux", from Act III of "Pelléas et Mélisande". He made a set of <a href="piano%20rolls">piano rolls</a> for the <a href="Welte-Mignon">Welte-Mignon</a> company in 1913. They contain fourteen of his pieces: "D'un cahier d'esquisses", "La plus que lente", "La soirée dans Grenade", all six movements of "Children's Corner", and five of the "Preludes": "Danseuses de Delphes", "Le vent dans la plaine", "La cathédrale engloutie", "La danse de Puck" and "Minstrels". The 1904 and 1913 sets have been transferred to compact disc.

Contemporaries of Debussy who made recordings of his music, included the pianists <a href="Ricardo%20Vi%C3%B1es">Ricardo Viñes</a> (in "Poissons d'or" from "Images" and "La soirée dans Grenade" from "Estampes"); <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a> (numerous solo pieces as well as the Violin Sonata with <a href="Jacques%20Thibaud">Jacques Thibaud</a> and the "Chansons de Bilitis" with <a href="Maggie%20Teyte">Maggie Teyte</a>); and <a href="Marguerite%20Long">Marguerite Long</a> ("Jardins sous la pluie" and "Arabesques"). Singers in Debussy's mélodies or excerpts from "Pelléas et Mélisande" included <a href="Jane%20Bathori">Jane Bathori</a>, <a href="Claire%20Croiza">Claire Croiza</a>, <a href="Charles%20Panz%C3%A9ra">Charles Panzéra</a> and <a href="Ninon%20Vallin">Ninon Vallin</a>; and among the conductors in the major orchestral works were <a href="Ernest%20Ansermet">Ernest Ansermet</a>, <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9-%C3%89mile%20Inghelbrecht">Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a> and <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, and in the "Petite Suite", <a href="Henri%20B%C3%BCsser">Henri Büsser</a>, who had prepared the orchestration for Debussy. Many of these early recordings have been reissued on CD.

In more recent times Debussy's output has been extensively recorded. In 2018, to mark the centenary of the composer's death, <a href="Warner%20Classics">Warner Classics</a>, with contributions from other companies, issued a 33-CD set that is claimed to include all the music Debussy wrote.

Canis Major

Canis Major is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern celestial hemisphere</a>. In the second century, it was included in <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "greater dog" in contrast to <a href="Canis%20Minor">Canis Minor</a>, the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> the hunter through the sky. The <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through Canis Major and several <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s lie within its borders, most notably <a href="Messier%2041">M41</a>.

Canis Major contains <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star</a> in the night sky, known as the "dog star". It is bright because of its proximity to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>. At magnitude 1.5, <a href="Epsilon%20Canis%20Majoris">Epsilon Canis Majoris</a> (Adhara) is the second-brightest star of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> and the brightest source of <a href="extreme%20ultraviolet">extreme ultraviolet</a> radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant <a href="Delta%20Canis%20Majoris">Delta</a> (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant <a href="Beta%20Canis%20Majoris">Beta</a> (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants <a href="Eta%20Canis%20Majoris">Eta</a> (Aludra) at 2.4 and <a href="Omicron1%20Canis%20Majoris">Omicron</a> at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary <a href="Zeta%20Canis%20Majoris">Zeta</a> (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant <a href="VY%20Canis%20Majoris">VY Canis Majoris</a> is one of the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20known%20stars">largest stars known</a>, while the <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> <a href="RX%20J0720.4-3125">RX J0720.4-3125</a> has a radius of a mere 5 km.

In ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>ians, was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a> were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the "<a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues%23Three%20Stars%20Each">Three Stars Each</a>" tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled "<a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>", the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior <a href="Ninurta">Ninurta</a>, and the bow with <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, daughter of <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>. Ninurta was linked to the later deity <a href="Marduk">Marduk</a>, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess <a href="Tiamat">Tiamat</a> with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.

In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog <a href="Laelaps%20%28mythology%29">Laelaps</a>, a gift from <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> to <a href="Europa%20%28mythology%29">Europa</a>; or sometimes the hound of <a href="Procris">Procris</a>, <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana's</a> nymph; or the one given by <a href="Eos">Aurora</a> to <a href="Cephalus">Cephalus</a>, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing <a href="Lepus%20%28constellation%29">Lepus</a> the <a href="Hare">Hare</a> or helping Orion fight <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> the Bull; and is referred to in this way by <a href="Aratus">Aratos</a>, <a href="Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>. The <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> refer only to one dog, but by <a href="ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> times, <a href="Canis%20Minor">Canis Minor</a> appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 "<a href="Alfonsine%20tables">Alfonsine tables</a>".

The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as "Custos Europae", the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> in the form of a bull, and as "<a href="Cerberus">Janitor Lethaeus</a>", "the watchdog". In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became "al-Kalb al-Akbar", "the Greater Dog", transcribed as "Alcheleb Alachbar" by 17th century writer <a href="Edmund%20Chilmead">Edmund Chilmead</a>. Islamic scholar <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Ray%E1%B8%A5%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī</a> referred to Orion as "Kalb al-Jabbār", "the Dog of the Giant". Among the <a href="Merazig">Merazig</a> of <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called "<a href="Merzem">Merzem</a>", includes the stars of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, the modern constellation of <a href="Canis%20Major%20%28Chinese%20astronomy%29">Canis Major</a> is located in the <a href="Vermilion%20Bird">Vermilion Bird</a> (), where the stars were classified in several separate <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>s of stars. The Military Market () was a circular pattern of stars containing <a href="Nu3%20Canis%20Majoris">Nu</a>, <a href="Beta%20Canis%20Majoris">Beta</a>, <a href="Xi1%20Canis%20Majoris">Xi</a> and <a href="Xi2%20Canis%20Majoris">Xi</a>, and some stars from Lepus. The Wild Cockerel () was at the centre of the Military Market, although it is uncertain which stars depicted what. Schlegel reported that the stars <a href="Omicron%20Canis%20Majoris">Omicron</a> and <a href="Pi%20Canis%20Majoris">Pi Canis Majoris</a> might have been them, while Beta or <a href="Nu2%20Canis%20Majoris">Nu</a> have also been proposed. <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> was ' (), the Celestial Wolf, denoting invasion and plunder. Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism ' (), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing <a href="Delta%20Canis%20Majoris">Delta</a>, <a href="Epsilon%20Canis%20Majoris">Epsilon</a>, <a href="Eta%20Canis%20Majoris">Eta</a> and <a href="Kappa%20Canis%20Majoris">Kappa Canis Majoris</a> and <a href="Delta%20Velorum">Delta Velorum</a>. Alternatively, the arrow was depicted by <a href="Omicron2%20Canis%20Majoris">Omicron</a> and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf), while the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, <a href="Sigma%20Canis%20Majoris">Sigma</a>, Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and <a href="Pi%20Puppis">Pi</a> and <a href="Omicron%20Puppis">Omicron Puppis</a>.

Both the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a> and the people of the <a href="Tuamotus">Tuamotus</a> recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. ', also called ' and ', ("The Assembly of " or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Māori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars. Related was ', also called ', the Mirror of , formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major. They called Sirius ' and ', corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though ' was a name applied to other stars in various Māori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies. The Tuamotu people called Canis Major "", "the abiding assemblage of ".

The Tharumba people of the <a href="Shoalhaven%20River">Shoalhaven River</a> saw three stars of Canis Major as ' (Bat) and his two wives ' (Mrs Brown Snake) and ' (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation '. To the <a href="Wergaia">Boorong</a> people of Victoria, <a href="Sigma%20Canis%20Majoris">Sigma Canis Majoris</a> was ' (which has become the official name of this star), and its flanking stars Delta and Epsilon were his two wives. The moon (', "<a href="Dasyurus">native cat</a>") sought to lure the further wife (Epsilon) away, but assaulted him and he has been wandering the sky ever since.

Canis Major is a constellation in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>'s summer (or northern hemisphere's winter) sky, bordered by <a href="Monoceros">Monoceros</a> (which lies between it and Canis Minor) to the north, Puppis to the east and southeast, <a href="Columba%20%28constellation%29">Columba</a> to the southwest, and Lepus to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'CMa'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a quadrilateral; in the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −11.03° and −33.25°. Covering 380 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 43rd of the 88 currently-recognized constellations in size.

Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star</a> in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0. Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another, <a href="NR%20Canis%20Majoris">NR Canis Majoris</a>, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.

The German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> used the Greek letters <a href="Alpha">Alpha</a> through <a href="Omicron">Omicron</a> to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron, while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe. Bayer's countryman <a href="Johann%20Elert%20Bode">Johann Elert Bode</a> later added Sigma, Tau and Omega; the French astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> added lettered stars a to k (though none are in use today). <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> numbered 31 stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as <a href="Delta%20Columbae">Delta Columbae</a> (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation). He also labelled two stars—his <a href="10%20Canis%20Majoris">10</a> and <a href="Kappa%20Canis%20Majoris">13 Canis Majoris</a>—as Kappa and Kappa respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a> and <a href="John%20Bevis">John Bevis</a> dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa as the sole Kappa. Flamsteed's listing of Nu, Nu, Nu, Xi, Xi, Omicron and Omicron have all remained in use.

Sirius is the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star in the night sky</a> at <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> −1.46 and one of the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">closest stars to Earth</a> at a distance of 8.6 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s. Its name comes from the Greek word for "scorching" or "searing". Sirius is also a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>; its companion <a href="Sirius%20B">Sirius B</a> is a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> with a magnitude of 8.4—10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth. The two <a href="orbit">orbit</a> each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20calendar">ancient Egyptian calendar</a>. The star marked the Great Dog's mouth on Bayer's star atlas.

Flanking Sirius are Beta and <a href="Gamma%20Canis%20Majoris">Gamma Canis Majoris</a>. Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a blue-white <a href="Beta%20Cephei%20variable">Beta Cephei variable</a> star of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over a period of six hours. Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its traditional name means "the announcer", referring to its position as the "announcer" of Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does. Gamma, also known as Muliphein, is a fainter star of magnitude 4.12, in reality a blue-white bright giant of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> B8IIe located 441 light-years from earth. <a href="Iota%20Canis%20Majoris">Iota Canis Majoris</a>, lying between Sirius and Gamma, is another star that has been classified as a Beta Cephei variable, varying from magnitude 4.36 to 4.40 over a period of 1.92 hours. It is a remote blue-white <a href="supergiant%20star">supergiant star</a> of spectral type B3Ib, around 46,000 times as luminous as the sun and, at 2500 light-years distant, 300 times further away than Sirius.

Epsilon, <a href="Omicron2%20Canis%20Majoris">Omicron</a>, Delta, and Eta Canis Majoris were called "Al Adzari" "the virgins" in medieval Arabic tradition. Marking the dog's right thigh on Bayer's atlas is Epsilon Canis Majoris, also known as Adhara. At magnitude 1.5, it is the second-brightest star in Canis Major and the 23rd-brightest star in the sky. It is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type B2Iab, around 404 light-years from Earth. This star is one of the brightest known extreme ultraviolet sources in the sky. It is a binary star; the secondary is of magnitude 7.4. Its traditional name means "the virgins", having been transferred from the group of stars to Epsilon alone. Nearby is Delta Canis Majoris, also called Wezen. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8Iab and magnitude 1.84, around 1605 light-years from Earth. With a traditional name meaning "the weight", Wezen is 17 times as massive and 50,000 times as luminous as the Sun. If located in the centre of the Solar System, it would extend out to Earth as its diameter is 200 times that of the Sun. Only around 10 million years old, Wezen has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core. Its outer envelope is beginning to expand and cool, and in the next 100,000 years it will become a red supergiant as its core fuses heavier and heavier elements. Once it has a core of iron, it will collapse and explode as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>. Nestled between Adhara and Wezen lies Sigma Canis Majoris, known as Unurgunite to the Boorong and Wotjobaluk people, a red supergiant of spectral type K7Ib that varies irregularly between magnitudes 3.43 and 3.51.

Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type B5Ia with a luminosity 176,000 times and diameter around 80 times that of the Sun. Classified as an <a href="Alpha%20Cygni%20variable">Alpha Cygni type</a> <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>, Aludra varies in brightness from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48 over a period of 4.7 days. It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies 3.0-magnitude <a href="Zeta%20Canis%20Majoris">Zeta Canis Majoris</a> or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth. It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the combined <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.

Between these stars and Sirius lie <a href="Omicron1%20Canis%20Majoris">Omicron</a>, Omicron, and <a href="Pi%20Canis%20Majoris">Pi Canis Majoris</a>. Omicron is a massive supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun. Only 7 million years old, it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium. It is an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron is an orange <a href="stellar%20classification">K-type</a> supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an <a href="irregular%20variable">irregular variable</a> star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. Around 18 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>.

North of Sirius lie <a href="Theta%20Canis%20Majoris">Theta</a> and <a href="Mu%20Canis%20Majoris">Mu Canis Majoris</a>, Theta being the most northerly star with a Bayer designation in the constellation. Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun's diameter. Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III, while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. <a href="Nu%20Canis%20Majoris">Nu Canis Majoris</a> is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is at the threshold of naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.

At the southern limits of the constellation lie Kappa and <a href="Lambda%20Canis%20Majoris">Lambda Canis Majoris</a>. Although of similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth, they are unrelated. Kappa is a <a href="Shell%20star">Gamma Cassiopeiae variable</a> of spectral type B2Vne, which brightened by 50% between 1963 and 1978, from magnitude 3.96 or so to 3.52. It is around 659 light-years distant. Lambda is a blue-white <a href="stellar%20classification">B-type</a> <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence dwarf</a> with an apparent magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. It is 3.7 times as wide as and 5.5 times as massive as the Sun, and shines with 940 times its luminosity.
Canis Major is also home to many variable stars. <a href="EZ%20Canis%20Majoris">EZ Canis Majoris</a> is a <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a> of spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766 days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation. <a href="VY%20Canis%20Majoris">VY Canis Majoris</a> is a remote <a href="red%20hypergiant">red hypergiant</a> located approximately 3,800 light-years away from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. It is one of <a href="List%20of%20largest%20stars">largest stars known</a> (sometimes described as the largest known) and is also <a href="List%20of%20most%20luminous%20stars">one of most luminous</a> with a radius varying from 1,420 to 2,200 times the Sun's radius, and a luminosity around 300,000 times greater than the Sun. Its current mass is about 17 ± 8 solar masses, having shed material from an initial mass of 25–32 solar masses. VY CMa is also surrounded by a red <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebula</a> that has been made by the material expelled by the strong stellar winds of its central star. <a href="W%20Canis%20Majoris">W Canis Majoris</a> is a type of red giant known as a <a href="carbon%20star">carbon star</a>—a semiregular variable, it ranges between magnitudes 6.27 and 7.09 over a period of 160 days. A cool star, it has a surface temperature of around 2,900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun, its distance estimated at 1,444–1,450 light-years from Earth. At the other extreme in size is <a href="RX%20J0720.4-3125">RX J0720.4-3125</a>, a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> with a radius of around 5 km. Exceedingly faint, it has an apparent magnitude of 26.6. Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously changing over several years. The nature of the changes are unclear, but it is possible they were caused by an event such as the star's absorption of an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a>.

<a href="Tau%20Canis%20Majoris">Tau Canis Majoris</a> is a <a href="Beta%20Lyrae%20variable">Beta Lyrae-type</a> eclipsing multiple star system that varies from magnitude 4.32 to 4.37 over 1.28 days. Its four main component stars are hot O-type stars, with a combined mass 80 times that of the Sun and shining with 500,000 times its luminosity, but little is known of their individual properties. A fifth component, a magnitude 10 star, lies at a distance of . The system is only 5 million years old. <a href="UW%20Canis%20Majoris">UW Canis Majoris</a> is another Beta Lyrae-type star 3000 light-years from Earth; it is an <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a> that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 5.3 to a maximum of 4.8. It has a period of 4.4 days; its components are two massive hot blue stars, one a <a href="blue%20supergiant">blue supergiant</a> of spectral type O7.5-8 Iab, while its companion is a slightly cooler, less evolved and less luminous supergiant of spectral type O9.7Ib. The stars are 200,000 and 63,000 times as luminous as the Sun. However the fainter star is the more massive at 19 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es to the primary's 16. <a href="R%20Canis%20Majoris">R Canis Majoris</a> is another eclipsing binary that varies from magnitude 5.7 to 6.34 over 1.13 days, with a third star orbiting these two every 93 years. The shortness of the orbital period and the low ratio between the two main components make this an unusual Algol-type system.

Seven star systems have been found to have planets. <a href="Nu2%20Canis%20Majoris">Nu Canis Majoris</a> is an ageing orange giant of spectral type K1III of apparent magnitude 3.91 located around 64 light-years distant. Around 1.5 times as massive and 11 times as luminous as the Sun, it is orbited over a period of 763 days by a planet 2.6 times as massive as Jupiter. <a href="HD%2047536">HD 47536</a> is likewise an ageing orange giant found to have a planetary system—echoing the fate of the Solar System in a few billion years as the Sun ages and becomes a giant. Conversely, <a href="HD%2045364">HD 45364</a> is a star 107 light-years distant that is a little smaller and cooler than the Sun, of spectral type G8V, which has two planets discovered in 2008. With orbital periods of 228 and 342 days, the planets have a 3:2 <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a>, which helps stabilise the system. <a href="HD%2047186">HD 47186</a> is another sunlike star with two planets; the inner—<a href="HD%2047186%20b">HD 47186 b</a>—takes four days to complete an orbit and has been classified as a <a href="Hot%20Neptune">Hot Neptune</a>, while the outer—<a href="HD%2047186%20c">HD 47186 c</a>—has an eccentric 3.7-year period orbit and has a similar mass to <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>. <a href="HD%2043197">HD 43197</a> is a sunlike star around 183 light-years distant that has a Jupiter-size planet with an eccentric orbit.

<a href="Z%20Canis%20Majoris">Z Canis Majoris</a> is a star system a mere 300,000 years old composed of two <a href="pre-main-sequence%20star">pre-main-sequence star</a>s—a <a href="FU%20Orionis%20star">FU Orionis star</a> and a <a href="Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star">Herbig Ae/Be star</a>, which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The more massive Herbig Ae/Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of dust that has an inner diameter of and outer diameter of . The cocoon has a hole in it through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference. Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in-falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system. Both stars are emitting jets of material, that of the Herbig Ae/Be star being much larger—11.7 light-years long. Meanwhile, <a href="FS%20Canis%20Majoris">FS Canis Majoris</a> is another star with infra-red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust, but it appears to be a main-sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust.

The band of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> goes through Canis Major, with only patchy obscurement by <a href="cosmic%20dust">interstellar dust</a> clouds. It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation, as well as in a triangular area between Adhara, Wezen and Aludra, with many stars visible in binoculars. Canis Major boasts several <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s. The only <a href="Messier%20object">Messier object</a> is <a href="Messier%2041">M41</a> (NGC 2287), an open cluster with a combined <a href="visual%20magnitude">visual magnitude</a> of 4.5, around 2300 light-years from Earth. Located 4 degrees south of Sirius, it contains contrasting blue, yellow and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a>—in reality around 25 light-years in diameter. Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants. The brightest is a 6.3-magnitude star of spectral type K3. Located in the field is <a href="12%20Canis%20Majoris">12 Canis Majoris</a>, though this star is only 670 light-years distant. <a href="NGC%202360">NGC 2360</a>, known as Caroline's Cluster after its discoverer <a href="Caroline%20Herschel">Caroline Herschel</a>, is an open cluster located 3.5 degrees west of Muliphein and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. Around 15 light-years in diameter, it is located 3700 light-years away from Earth, and has been dated to around 2.2 billion years old. <a href="NGC%202362">NGC 2362</a> is a small, compact open cluster, 5200 light-years from Earth. It contains about 60 stars, of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member. Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen, it covers an area around 12 light-years in diameter, though the stars appear huddled around Tau when seen through binoculars. It is a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old. Lying 2 degrees southwest of NGC 2362 is <a href="NGC%202354">NGC 2354</a> a fainter open cluster of magnitude 6.5, with around 15 member stars visible with binoculars. Located around 30' northeast of NGC 2360, <a href="NGC%202359">NGC 2359</a> (Thor's Helmet or the Duck Nebula) is a relatively bright <a href="emission%20nebula">emission nebula</a> in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by <a href="HD%2056925">HD 56925</a>, an unstable <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a> embedded within it.

In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the <a href="Canis%20Major%20Overdensity">Canis Major Dwarf</a>, the closest <a href="satellite%20galaxy">satellite galaxy</a> to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae variable</a>s—consistent with the <a href="Milky%20Way%20halo">Milky Way's halo</a> and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> in Puppis, <a href="NGC%202298">NGC 2298</a>—which appears to be part of the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.

<a href="NGC%202207%20and%20IC%202163">NGC 2207 and IC 2163</a> are a pair of face-on <a href="interacting%20galaxy">interacting</a> spiral galaxies located 125 million light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a> in both galaxies. Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia <a href="SN%201975a">SN 1975a</a>), 1999 (the type Ib <a href="SN%201999ec">SN 1999ec</a>), 2003 (type 1b supernova <a href="SN%202003H">SN 2003H</a>), and 2013 (type II supernova <a href="SN%202013ai">SN 2013ai</a>).

Canis Minor

Canis Minor is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Celestial%20sphere">northern celestial hemisphere</a>. In the second century, it was included as an <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>, or pattern, of two stars in <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s 48 constellations, and it is counted among the <a href="List%20of%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "lesser dog", in contrast to <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a>, the "greater dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> the hunter.

Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a>, <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a> (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and <a href="Gomeisa">Gomeisa</a> (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-<a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star</a> in the night sky, as well as one of the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">closest</a>. A yellow-white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star, it has a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> <a href="Binary%20star">companion</a>. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. <a href="Luyten%27s%20Star">Luyten's Star</a> is a ninth-magnitude <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> and the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>'s next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude <a href="HD%2066141">HD 66141</a>, which has evolved into an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> towards the end of its <a href="stellar%20evolution">life cycle</a>, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s within the constellation's borders. The 11 <a href="Canis-Minorids">Canis-Minorids</a> are a <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> that can be seen in early December.

Though strongly associated with the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greek</a> <a href="celestial%20cartography">uranographic</a> tradition, Canis Minor originates from ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Procyon and Gomeisa were called "MASH.TAB.BA" or "twins" in the "<a href="Three%20Stars%20Each">Three Stars Each</a>" tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later "<a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>", this name was also applied to the pairs of <a href="Pi3%20Orionis">Pi</a> and <a href="Pi4%20Orionis">Pi Orionis</a> and <a href="Zeta%20Geminorum">Zeta</a> and <a href="Xi%20Orionis">Xi Orionis</a>. The meaning of "MASH.TAB.BA" evolved as well, becoming the twin deities <a href="Lulal">Lulal</a> and <a href="Latarak">Latarak</a>, who are on the opposite side of the sky from "<a href="Papsukal">Papsukal</a>", the True Shepherd of Heaven in <a href="Babylonian%20mythology">Babylonian mythology</a>. Canis Minor was also given the name "DAR.LUGAL", its position defined as "the star which stands behind it [Orion]", in the "MUL.APIN"; the constellation represents a <a href="rooster">rooster</a>. This name may have also referred to the constellation <a href="Lepus%20%28constellation%29">Lepus</a>. "DAR.LUGAL" was also denoted "DAR.MUŠEN" and "DAR.LUGAL.MUŠEN" in Babylonia. Canis Minor was then called "tarlugallu" in <a href="Akkadian%20astronomy">Akkadian astronomy</a>.

Canis Minor was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> in his second-century <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>, in which it was defined as a specific pattern (<a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>) of stars; Ptolemy identified only two stars and hence no depiction was possible. The <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>s called the constellation προκυων/"Procyon", "coming before the dog", transliterated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Antecanis", "Praecanis", or variations thereof, by Cicero and others. Roman writers also appended the descriptors "parvus", "minor" or "minusculus" ("small" or "lesser", for its faintness), "septentrionalis" ("northerly", for its position in relation to Canis Major), "primus" (rising "first") or "sinister" (rising to the "left") to its name "Canis". 
In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Canis Minor was sometimes connected with the <a href="Teumessian%20fox">Teumessian Fox</a>, a beast turned into stone with its hunter, <a href="Laelaps%20%28mythology%29">Laelaps</a>, by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, who placed them in heaven as Canis Major (Laelaps) and Canis Minor (Teumessian Fox). <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> accompanied the Little Dog with Orion, while <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Hyginus</a> linked the constellation with <a href="Maera%20%28hound%29">Maera</a>, a dog owned by <a href="Icarius%23Icarius%20of%20Athens">Icarius of Athens</a>. On discovering the latter's death, the dog and Icarius' daughter <a href="Erigone%20%28daughter%20of%20Icarius%29">Erigone</a> took their lives and all three were placed in the sky—Erigone as <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a> and Icarius as <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a>. As a reward for his faithfulness, the dog was placed along the "banks" of the Milky Way, which the ancients believed to be a heavenly river, where he would never suffer from thirst.

The <a href="astronomy%20in%20medieval%20Islam">medieval Arabic astronomers</a> maintained the depiction of Canis Minor ("al-Kalb al-Asghar" in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>) as a dog; in his <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Fixed%20Stars">Book of the Fixed Stars</a>, <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Sufi">Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi</a> included a diagram of the constellation with a canine figure superimposed. There was one slight difference between the Ptolemaic vision of Canis Minor and the Arabic; al-Sufi claims <a href="Mirzam">Mirzam</a>, now assigned to <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>, as part of both Canis Minor—the collar of the dog—and its modern home. The Arabic names for both Procyon and Gomeisa alluded to their proximity and resemblance to Sirius, though they were not direct translations of the Greek; Procyon was called "ash-Shi'ra ash-Shamiya", the "Syrian Sirius" and Gomeisa was called "ash-Shira al-Ghamisa", the Sirius with bleary eyes. Among the <a href="Merazig">Merazig</a> of <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called "Merzem", includes the stars of Canis Minor and Canis Major and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.

The ancient Egyptians thought of this constellation as <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, the jackal god.

Alternative names have been proposed: <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in the early 17th century termed the constellation "Fovea" "The Pit", and "Morus" "<a href="Sycamine">Sycamine</a> Tree". Seventeenth-century German poet and author <a href="Philipp%20von%20Zesen">Philippus Caesius</a> linked it to the dog of Tobias from the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>. <a href="Richard%20A.%20Proctor">Richard A. Proctor</a> gave the constellation the name "Felis" "the Cat" in 1870 (contrasting with Canis Major, which he had abbreviated to "Canis" "the Dog"), explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on <a href="Star%20chart">celestial charts</a>. Occasionally, Canis Minor is confused with Canis Major and given the name "Canis Orionis" ("Orion's Dog").

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, the stars corresponding to Canis Minor lie in the <a href="Vermilion%20Bird%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Vermilion Bird of the South</a> (南方朱雀, "Nán Fāng Zhū Què"). Procyon, Gomeisa and Eta Canis Minoris form an <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> known as Nánhé, the Southern River. With its counterpart, the Northern River Beihe (<a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>), Nánhé was also associated with a gate or sentry. Along with <a href="Zeta%20Cancri">Zeta</a> and <a href="8%20Cancri">8 Cancri</a>, <a href="6%20Canis%20Minoris">6 Canis Minoris</a> and <a href="11%20Canis%20Minoris">11 Canis Minoris</a> formed the asterism "Shuiwei", which literally means "water level". Combined with additional stars in <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a>, Shuiwei represented an official who managed floodwaters or a marker of the water level. Neighboring Korea recognized four stars in Canis Minor as part of a different constellation, "the position of the water". This constellation was located in the Red Bird, the southern portion of the sky.

<a href="Polynesian%20people">Polynesian people</a>s often did not recognize Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the <a href="Tuamotu%20Archipelago">Tuamotu Archipelago</a> it was known as "Hiro", meaning "twist as a thread of coconut fiber", and "Kopu-nui-o-Hiro" ("great paunch of Hiro"), which was either a name for the modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included "Vena" (after a <a href="goddess">goddess</a>), on <a href="Mangaia">Mangaia</a> and "Puanga-hori" (false "Puanga", the name for <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a>), in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. In the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, Procyon was called "Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava", literally "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the "pillar for elocution". The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names "Magum" and "Gurumana", describing them as humans who were transformed into <a href="Eucalyptus">gum trees</a> in the <a href="dreamtime">dreamtime</a>. Although their skin had turned to bark, they were able to speak with a human voice by rustling their leaves.

The <a href="Aztec%20calendar">Aztec calendar</a> was related to <a href="Aztec%20astronomy">their cosmology</a>. The stars of Canis Minor were incorporated along with some stars of Orion and Gemini into an asterism associated with the day called "Water".

Lying directly south of <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini's</a> bright stars <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>, Canis Minor is a small constellation bordered by <a href="Monoceros">Monoceros</a> to the south, Gemini to the north, <a href="Cancer%20%28constellation%29">Cancer</a> to the northeast, and <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a> to the east. It does not border <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a>; Monoceros is in between the two. Covering 183 square degrees, Canis Minor ranks seventy-first of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>'s winter. The constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between and . Most visible in the evening sky from January to March, Canis Minor is most prominent at 10 PM during mid-February. It is then seen earlier in the evening until July, when it is only visible after sunset before setting itself, and rising in the morning sky before dawn. The constellation's three-letter abbreviation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is "CMi".

Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than fourth <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a>. At magnitude 0.34, <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a>, or Alpha Canis Minoris, is the seventh-<a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest star</a> in the night sky, as well as one of the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">closest</a>. Its name means "before the dog" or "preceding the dog" in Greek, as it rises an hour before the "Dog Star", <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, of <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a>. It is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system, consisting of a yellow-white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star of <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> F5 IV-V, named Procyon A, and a faint <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> companion of spectral type DA, named Procyon B. Procyon B, which orbits the more massive star every 41 years, is of magnitude 10.7. Procyon A is 1.4 times the <a href="solar%20mass">Sun's mass</a>, while its smaller companion is 0.6 times as massive as the Sun. The system is from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, the shortest distance to a northern-hemisphere star of the first magnitude. <a href="Gomeisa">Gomeisa</a>, or Beta Canis Minoris, with a magnitude of 2.89, is the second-brightest star in Canis Minor. Lying from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, it is a blue-white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star of <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> B8 Ve. Although fainter to Earth observers, it is much brighter than Procyon, and is 250 times as <a href="Luminosity%23Astronomy">luminous</a> and three times as massive as the Sun. Although its variations are slight, Gomeisa is classified as a <a href="shell%20star">shell star</a> (Gamma Cassiopeiae variable), with a maximum magnitude of 2.84 and a minimum magnitude of 2.92. It is surrounded by a disk of gas which it heats and causes to emit radiation.

<a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> used the Greek letters Alpha to Eta to label the most prominent eight stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Delta (named Delta and Delta). <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> numbered fourteen stars, discerning a third star he named Delta; his star 12 Canis Minoris was not found subsequently. In Bayer's 1603 work "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>", Procyon is located on the dog's belly, and Gomeisa on its neck. <a href="Gamma%20Canis%20Minoris">Gamma</a>, <a href="Epsilon%20Canis%20Minoris">Epsilon</a> and <a href="Eta%20Canis%20Minoris">Eta Canis Minoris</a> lie nearby, marking the dog's neck, crown and chest respectively. Although it has an apparent magnitude of 4.34, Gamma Canis Minoris is an orange <a href="stellar%20classification">K-type</a> <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of spectral class K3-III C, which lies away. Its colour is obvious when seen through binoculars. It is a multiple system, consisting of the <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> Gamma A and three optical companions, Gamma B, magnitude 13; Gamma C, magnitude 12; and Gamma D, magnitude 10. The two components of Gamma A orbit each other every 389.2 days, with an eccentric orbit that takes their separation between 2.3 and 1.4 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU). Epsilon Canis Minoris is a yellow <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a> of spectral class G6.5IIb of magnitude of 4.99. It lies from Earth, with 13 times the diameter and 750 times the luminosity of the Sun. Eta Canis Minoris is a giant of spectral class F0III of magnitude 5.24, which has a yellowish hue when viewed through binoculars as well as a faint companion of magnitude 11.1. Located 4 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s from the primary, the companion star is actually around 440 AU from the main star and takes around 5000 years to orbit it.

Near Procyon, three stars share the name <a href="Delta%20Canis%20Minoris">Delta Canis Minoris</a>. <a href="Delta1%20Canis%20Minoris">Delta</a> is a yellow-white <a href="stellar%20classification">F-type</a> <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of magnitude 5.25 located around from Earth. About 360 times as luminous and 3.75 times as massive as the Sun, it is expanding and cooling as it ages, having spent much of its life as a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">main sequence star</a> of spectrum B6V. Also known as 8 Canis Minoris, <a href="Delta2%20Canis%20Minoris">Delta</a> is an <a href="F-type%20main-sequence%20star">F-type main-sequence star</a> of spectral type F2V and magnitude 5.59 which is distant. The last of the trio, <a href="Delta3%20Canis%20Minoris">Delta</a> (also known as 9 Canis Minoris), is a <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main sequence star</a> of spectral type A0Vnn and magnitude 5.83 which is distant. These stars mark the paws of the Lesser Dog's left hind leg, while magnitude 5.13 <a href="Zeta%20Canis%20Minoris">Zeta</a> marks the right. A blue-white <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a> of spectral type B8II, Zeta lies around away from the Solar System.

Lying 222 ± 7 light-years away with an apparent magnitude of 4.39, <a href="HD%2066141">HD 66141</a> is 6.8 billion years old and has <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Mid-sized%20stars">evolved</a> into an orange giant of spectral type K2III with a diameter around 22 times that of the Sun, and weighing 1.1 solar masses. It is 174 times as luminous as the Sun, with an <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of −0.15. HD 66141 was mistakenly named 13 Puppis, as its celestial coordinates were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in the constellation of <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a>; Bode gave it the name Lambda Canis Minoris, which is now obsolete. The orange giant is orbited by a planet, <a href="HD%2066141b">HD 66141b</a>, which was detected in 2012 by measuring the star's <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a>. The planet has a mass around 6 times that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and a <a href="orbital%20period">period</a> of 480 days.

A <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M4III, <a href="BC%20Canis%20Minoris">BC Canis Minoris</a> lies around distant from the Solar System. It is a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable star</a> that varies between a maximum magnitude of 6.14 and minimum magnitude of 6.42. Periods of 27.7, 143.3 and 208.3 days have been recorded in its pulsations. <a href="AZ%20Canis%20Minoris">AZ</a>, <a href="AD%20Canis%20Minoris">AD</a> and <a href="BI%20Canis%20Minoris">BI Canis Minoris</a> are <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>s—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="astroseismology">astroseismology</a>. AZ is of spectral type F0III, and ranges between magnitudes 6.44 and 6.51 over a period of 2.3 hours. AD has a spectral type of F2III, and has a maximum magnitude of 9.21 and minimum of 9.51, with a period of approximately 2.95 hours. BI is of spectral type F2 with an apparent magnitude varying around 9.19 and a period of approximately 2.91 hours.

At least three red giants are <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a>s in Canis Minor. <a href="S%20Canis%20Minoris">S Canis Minoris</a>, of spectral type M7e, is the brightest, ranging from magnitude 6.6 to 13.2 over a period of 332.94 days. <a href="V%20Canis%20Minoris">V Canis Minoris</a> ranges from magnitude 7.4 to 15.1 over a period of 366.1 days. Similar in magnitude is <a href="R%20Canis%20Minoris">R Canis Minoris</a>, which has a maximum of 7.3, but a significantly brighter minimum of 11.6. An <a href="S-type%20star">S-type star</a>, it has a period of 337.8 days.

<a href="YZ%20Canis%20Minoris">YZ Canis Minoris</a> is a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> of spectral type M4.5V and magnitude 11.2, roughly three times the size of Jupiter and from Earth. It is a <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a>, emitting unpredictable outbursts of energy for mere minutes, which might be much more powerful analogues of <a href="solar%20flare">solar flare</a>s. <a href="Luyten%27s%20Star">Luyten's Star</a> (GJ 273) is a red dwarf star of spectral type M3.5V and close neighbour of the Solar System. Its visual magnitude of 9.9 renders it too faint to be seen with the naked eye, even though it is only away. Fainter still is <a href="PSS%20544-7">PSS 544-7</a>, an eighteenth-magnitude red dwarf around 20 percent the mass of the Sun, located from Earth. First noticed in 1991, it is thought to be a cannonball star, shot out of a star cluster and now moving rapidly through space directly away from the <a href="Disc%20%28galaxy%29">galactic disc</a>.

The <a href="WZ%20Sagittae">WZ Sagittae</a>-type <a href="dwarf%20nova">dwarf nova</a> <a href="DY%20Canis%20Minoris">DY Canis Minoris</a> (also known as <a href="VSX%20J074727.6%2B065050">VSX J074727.6+065050</a>) flared up to magnitude 11.4 over January and February 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19.5 over approximately 80 days. It is a remote binary star system where a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> and low mass star orbit each other close enough for the former star to draw material off the latter and form an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a>. This material builds up until it erupts dramatically.

The <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through much of Canis Minor, yet it has few <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s. <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> recorded four objects in his 1786 work "<a href="Catalogue%20of%20Nebulae%20and%20Clusters%20of%20Stars">Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars</a>", including two he mistakenly believed were star clusters. <a href="NGC%202459">NGC 2459</a> is a group of five thirteenth- and fourteenth-magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in the sky but are not related. A similar situation has occurred with <a href="NGC%202394">NGC 2394</a>, also in Canis Minor. This is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth-magnitude and fainter.

Herschel also observed three faint galaxies, two of which are interacting with each other. <a href="NGC%202508">NGC 2508</a> is a <a href="lenticular%20galaxy">lenticular galaxy</a> of thirteenth-magnitude, estimated at 205 million light-years (63 million parsecs) distance with a diameter of 80 thousand light-years (25 thousand parsecs). Named as a single object by Herschel, <a href="NGC%202402">NGC 2402</a> is actually a pair of near-adjacent galaxies that appear to be interacting with each other. Only of fourteenth- and fifteenth-magnitudes respectively, the elliptical and spiral galaxy are thought to be approximately 245 million light-years distant, and each measure 55,000 light-years in diameter.

The 11 <a href="Canis-Minorids">Canis-Minorids</a>, also called the Beta Canis Minorids, are a <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> that arise near the fifth-magnitude star <a href="11%20Canis%20Minoris">11 Canis Minoris</a> and were discovered in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a> and proposed a common origin with the comet <a href="D/1917%20F1">D/1917 F1</a> Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently as the number of orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link. They last from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.

Corona Borealis

Corona Borealis is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, and remains one of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>. Its brightest <a href="star">star</a>s form a semicircular arc. Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means "northern crown". In <a href="classical%20mythology">classical mythology</a> Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> to the Cretan princess <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a> and set by him in the heavens. Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders, an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or even a smokehole. Ptolemy also listed a southern counterpart, <a href="Corona%20Australis">Corona Australis</a>, with a similar pattern.

The brightest star is the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 2.2 <a href="Alpha%20Coronae%20Borealis">Alpha Coronae Borealis</a>. The yellow supergiant <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis">R Coronae Borealis</a> is the prototype of a rare class of giant stars—the <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a>s—that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs. <a href="T%20Coronae%20Borealis">T Coronae Borealis</a>, also known as the Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a <a href="recurrent%20nova">recurrent nova</a>. Normally of magnitude 10, it last flared up to magnitude 2 in 1946. <a href="ADS%209731">ADS 9731</a> and <a href="Sigma%20Coronae%20Borealis">Sigma Coronae Borealis</a> are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-sized <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>s. <a href="Abell%202065">Abell 2065</a> is a highly concentrated <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a> one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger <a href="Corona%20Borealis%20Supercluster">Corona Borealis Supercluster</a>.

Covering 179 square degrees and hence 0.433% of the sky, Corona Borealis ranks 73rd of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole <a href="constellation">constellation</a> is visible to observers north of <a href="50th%20parallel%20south">50°S</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a> to the north and west, <a href="Serpens">Serpens Caput</a> to the south, and <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a> to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'CrB'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between 39.71° and 25.54°. It has a counterpart—<a href="Corona%20Australis">Corona Australis</a>—in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a>.

The seven stars that make up the constellation's distinctive crown-shaped pattern are all 4th-magnitude stars except for the brightest of them, <a href="Alpha%20Coronae%20Borealis">Alpha Coronae Borealis</a>. The other six stars are <a href="Theta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Theta</a>, <a href="Beta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Beta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Coronae%20Borealis">Gamma</a>, <a href="Delta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Delta</a>, <a href="Epsilon%20Coronae%20Borealis">Epsilon</a> and <a href="Iota%20Coronae%20Borealis">Iota Coronae Borealis</a>. The German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> gave twenty stars in Corona Borealis <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 <a href="star%20atlas">star atlas</a> "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". Zeta Coronae Borealis was noted to be a double star by later astronomers and its components designated <a href="Zeta1%20Coronae%20Borealis">Zeta</a> and <a href="Zeta2%20Coronae%20Borealis">Zeta</a>. <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> did likewise with Nu Coronae Borealis; classed by Bayer as a single star, it was noted to be two close stars by Flamsteed. He named them 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis in <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">his catalogue</a>, alongside the designations <a href="Nu1%20Coronae%20Borealis">Nu</a> and <a href="Nu2%20Coronae%20Borealis">Nu</a> respectively. Chinese astronomers deemed nine stars to make up the asterism, adding <a href="Pi%20Coronae%20Borealis">Pi</a> and <a href="Rho%20Coronae%20Borealis">Rho Coronae Borealis</a>. Within the constellation's borders, there are 37 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.
Alpha Coronae Borealis (officially named Alphecca by the IAU, but sometimes also known as Gemma) appears as a blue-white star of magnitude 2.2. In fact, it is an <a href="Algol">Algol</a>-type <a href="Binary%20star%23eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary</a> that varies by 0.1 magnitude with a period of 17.4 days. The primary is a <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main-sequence star</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> A0V that is 2.91 times the <a href="mass%20of%20the%20Sun">mass of the Sun</a> () and 57 times as <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> (), and is surrounded by a <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> out to a radius of around 60 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU). The secondary companion is a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow main-sequence star</a> of spectral type G5V that is a little smaller (0.9 times) the diameter of the Sun. Lying 75±0.5 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth, Alphecca is believed to be a member of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20Moving%20Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a> of stars that have a common motion through space.

Located 112±3 light-years away, <a href="Beta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Beta Coronae Borealis</a> or Nusakan is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> system whose two components are separated by 10 AU and orbit each other every 10.5 years. The brighter component is a <a href="rapidly%20oscillating%20Ap%20star">rapidly oscillating Ap star</a>, pulsating with a period of 16.2 minutes. Of spectral type A5V with a <a href="effective%20temperature">surface temperature</a> of around 7980 K, it has around , 2.6 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a> (), and . The smaller star is of spectral type F2V with a surface temperature of around 6750 K, and has around , , and between 4 and . Near Nusakan is <a href="Theta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Theta Coronae Borealis</a>, a binary system that shines with a combined magnitude of 4.13 located 380±20 light-years distant. The brighter component, Theta Coronae Borealis A, is a blue-white star that spins extremely rapidly—at a rate of around 393 km per second. A <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a>, it is surrounded by a debris disk.

Flanking Alpha to the east is Gamma Coronae Borealis, yet another binary star system, whose components orbit each other every 92.94 years and are roughly as far apart from each other as the Sun and Neptune. The brighter component has been classed as a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a> star, though this view is not universal. The components are main sequence stars of spectral types B9V and A3V. Located 170±2 light-years away, 4.06-magnitude <a href="Delta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Delta Coronae Borealis</a> is a yellow giant star of spectral type G3.5III that is around and has swollen to . It has a surface temperature of 5180 K. For most of its existence, Delta Coronae Borealis was a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white main-sequence star</a> of spectral type B before it ran out of hydrogen fuel in its core. Its luminosity and spectrum suggest it has just crossed the <a href="Hertzsprung%20gap">Hertzsprung gap</a>, having finished burning core hydrogen and just begun burning hydrogen in a shell that surrounds the core.

<a href="Zeta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Zeta Coronae Borealis</a> is a double star with two blue-white components 6.3 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a> apart that can be readily separated at 100x <a href="magnification%23Calculating%20the%20magnification%20of%20optical%20systems">magnification</a>. The primary is of magnitude 5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0. <a href="Nu%20Coronae%20Borealis">Nu Coronae Borealis</a> is an <a href="Double%20star">optical double</a>, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocities</a>, hence are assumed to be unrelated. The primary, <a href="Nu1%20Coronae%20Borealis">Nu Coronae Borealis</a>, is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, <a href="Nu2%20Coronae%20Borealis">Nu Coronae Borealis</a>, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30 light-years away. <a href="Sigma%20Coronae%20Borealis">Sigma Coronae Borealis</a>, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14 days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726 years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> system that is 14,000 AU distant from the other three stars. <a href="ADS%209731">ADS 9731</a> is an even rarer multiple system in the constellation, composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.

Corona Borealis is home to two remarkable <a href="Variable%20star">variable</a> stars. <a href="T%20Coronae%20Borealis">T Coronae Borealis</a> is a <a href="cataclysmic%20variable%20star">cataclysmic variable star</a> also known as the Blaze Star. Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis is one of a handful of stars called <a href="recurrent%20nova">recurrent nova</a>e, which include <a href="T%20Pyxidis">T Pyxidis</a> and <a href="U%20Scorpii">U Scorpii</a>. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its second recorded outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> with a red-hued giant primary and a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> secondary, the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months. <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis">R Coronae Borealis</a> is a yellow-hued variable <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a>s. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it. Direct imaging with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000 AU from the star, corresponding with a stream of fine dust (composed of grains 5 <a href="nanometre">nm</a> in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind and coarser dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>) ejected periodically.

There are several other variables of reasonable brightness for amateur astronomer to observe, including three <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira-type</a> long period variables: <a href="S%20Coronae%20Borealis">S Coronae Borealis</a> ranges between magnitudes 5.8 and 14.1 over a period of 360 days. Located around 1946 light-years distant, it shines with a luminosity 16,643 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 3033 K. One of the reddest stars in the sky, <a href="V%20Coronae%20Borealis">V Coronae Borealis</a> is a cool star with a surface temperature of 2877 K that shines with a luminosity 102,831 times that of the Sun and is a remote 8810 light-years distant from Earth. Varying between magnitudes 6.9 and 12.6 over a period of 357 days, it is located near the junction of the border of Corona Borealis with Hercules and Bootes. Located 1.5° northeast of <a href="Tau%20Coronae%20Borealis">Tau Coronae Borealis</a>, <a href="W%20Coronae%20Borealis">W Coronae Borealis</a> ranges between magnitudes 7.8 and 14.3 over a period of 238 days. Another red giant, <a href="RR%20Coronae%20Borealis">RR Coronae Borealis</a> is a <a href="stellar%20classification">M3-type</a> <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable star</a> that varies between magnitudes 7.3 and 8.2 over 60.8 days. <a href="RS%20Coronae%20Borealis">RS Coronae Borealis</a> is yet another semiregular variable red giant, which ranges between magnitudes 8.7 to 11.6 over 332 days. It is unusual in that it is a red star with a high proper motion (greater than 50 milliarcseconds a year). Meanwhile, <a href="U%20Coronae%20Borealis">U Coronae Borealis</a> is an Algol-type eclipsing binary star system whose magnitude varies between 7.66 and 8.79 over a period of 3.45 days

<a href="TY%20Coronae%20Borealis">TY Coronae Borealis</a> is a <a href="pulsating%20white%20dwarf">pulsating white dwarf</a> (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, <a href="UW%20Coronae%20Borealis">UW Coronae Borealis</a> is a <a href="X-ray%20binary%23Low-mass%20X-ray%20binary">low-mass X-ray binary</a> system composed of a star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> that draws material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, yet there is another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star. The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the accretion disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to <a href="Precession%20%28mechanical%29">precess</a> around the star.

<a href="Extrasolar%20planets">Extrasolar planets</a> have been confirmed in five star systems, four of which were found by the <a href="methods%20of%20detecting%20exoplanets%23Radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> method. The spectrum of <a href="Epsilon%20Coronae%20Borealis">Epsilon Coronae Borealis</a> was analysed for seven years from 2005 to 2012, revealing a planet around 6.7 times as massive as <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> () orbiting every 418 days at an average distance of around 1.3 AU. Epsilon itself is a orange giant of spectral type K2III that has swollen to and . <a href="Kappa%20Coronae%20Borealis">Kappa Coronae Borealis</a> is a spectral type K1IV orange subgiant nearly twice as massive as the Sun; around it lie a dust debris disk, and one planet with a period of 3.4 years. This planet's mass is estimated at . The dimensions of the debris disk indicate it is likely there is a second substellar companion. <a href="Omicron%20Coronae%20Borealis">Omicron Coronae Borealis</a> is a K-type <a href="Red%20clump">clump giant</a> with one confirmed planet with a mass of that orbits every 187 days—one of the two least massive planets known around clump giants. <a href="HD%20145457">HD 145457</a> is an orange giant of spectral type K0III found to have one planet of . Discovered by the Doppler method in 2010, it takes 176 days to complete an orbit. <a href="XO-1">XO-1</a> is a magnitude 11 <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow main-sequence star</a> located approximately light-years away, of spectral type G1V with a mass and radius similar to the Sun. In 2006 the <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a> exoplanet <a href="XO-1b">XO-1b</a> was discovered orbiting XO-1 by the <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20exoplanets%23Transit%20method">transit method</a> using the <a href="XO%20Telescope">XO Telescope</a>. Roughly the size of Jupiter, it completes an orbit around its star every three days.

The discovery of a Jupiter-sized planetary companion was announced in 1997 via analysis of the radial velocity of Rho Coronae Borealis, a yellow main sequence star and <a href="Solar%20analog">Solar analog</a> of spectral type G0V, around 57 light-years distant from Earth. More accurate measurement of data from the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite subsequently showed it instead to be a low-mass star somewhere between 100 and 200 times the mass of Jupiter. Possible stable planetary orbits in the <a href="Circumstellar%20habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> were calculated for the binary star <a href="Eta%20Coronae%20Borealis">Eta Coronae Borealis</a>, which is composed of two stars—yellow main sequence stars of spectral type G1V and G3V respectively—similar in mass and spectrum to the Sun. No planet has been found, but a brown dwarf companion about 63 times as massive as Jupiter with a spectral type of L8 was discovered at a distance of 3640 AU from the pair in 2001.

Corona Borealis contains few galaxies observable with amateur telescopes. <a href="NGC%206085">NGC 6085</a> and <a href="NGC%206086">6086</a> are a faint <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral</a> and <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> respectively close enough to each other to be seen in the same visual field through a telescope. <a href="Abell%202142">Abell 2142</a> is a huge (six million light-year diameter), <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> luminous <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a> that is the result of an ongoing merger between two galaxy clusters. It has a <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of 0.0909 (meaning it is moving away from us at 27,250 km/s) and a visual magnitude of 16.0. It is about 1.2 <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000%20%28number%29">billion</a> light-years away. Another galaxy cluster in the constellation, RX J1532.9+3021, is approximately 3.9 billion <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. At the cluster's center is a large elliptical galaxy containing one of the <a href="List%20of%20most%20massive%20black%20holes">most massive</a> and most powerful <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s yet discovered. <a href="Abell%202065">Abell 2065</a> is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster containing more than 400 members, the brightest of which are 16th magnitude; the cluster is more than one billion light-years from Earth. On a larger scale still, Abell 2065, along with <a href="Abell%202061">Abell 2061</a>, <a href="Abell%202067">Abell 2067</a>, <a href="Abell%202079">Abell 2079</a>, <a href="Abell%202089">Abell 2089</a>, and <a href="Abell%202092">Abell 2092</a>, make up the <a href="Corona%20Borealis%20Supercluster">Corona Borealis Supercluster</a>. Another galaxy cluster, <a href="Abell%202162">Abell 2162</a>, is a member of the <a href="Hercules%20Superclusters">Hercules Superclusters</a>.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Corona Borealis was linked to the legend of <a href="Theseus%23The%20myth%20of%20Theseus%20and%20the%20Minotaur">Theseus and the minotaur</a>. It was generally considered to represent a crown given by <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> to <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a>, the daughter of <a href="Minos">Minos</a> of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding. An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a> that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature, and Dionysus later sets it in the heavens. The Latin author <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Hyginus</a> linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case <a href="Semele">Semele</a>. Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>" of classical astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>.

In <a href="Welsh%20mythology">Welsh mythology</a>, it was called <a href="Caer%20Arianrhod">Caer Arianrhod</a>, "the Castle of the Silver Circle", and was the heavenly abode of the Lady <a href="Arianrhod">Arianrhod</a>. To the ancient Balts, Corona Borealis was known as "Darželis", the "flower garden".

The Arabs called the constellation Alphecca (a name later given to Alpha Coronae Borealis), which means "separated" or "broken up" ( '), a reference to the resemblance of the stars of Corona Borealis to a loose string of jewels. This was also interpreted as a broken dish. Among the <a href="Bedouins">Bedouins</a>, the constellation was known as ' (), or "the dish/bowl of the poor people".

The <a href="Skidi">Skidi</a> people of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> saw the stars of Corona Borealis representing a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their messages to the gods, as well as how chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> people saw the stars as the "Heavenly Sisters", who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the sky, with her heartbroken husband and son following later. The <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as "Mskegwǒm", the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).

<a href="Polynesian%20people">Polynesian people</a>s often recognized Corona Borealis; the people of the <a href="Tuamotus">Tuamotus</a> named it "Na Kaua-ki-tokerau" and probably "Te Hetu". The constellation was likely called "Kaua-mea" in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, "Rangawhenua" in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and "Te Wale-o-Awitu" in the Cook Islands atoll of <a href="Pukapuka">Pukapuka</a>. Its name in <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> was uncertain; it was either called "Ao-o-Uvea" or "Kau-kupenga".

In <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20astronomy">Australian Aboriginal astronomy</a>, the constellation is called "womera" ("the <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a>") due to the shape of the stars. The Wailwun people of northwestern New South Wales saw Corona Borealis as "mullion wollai" "eagle's nest", with <a href="Altair">Altair</a> and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>—each called "mullion"—the pair of eagles accompanying it. The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of northern Australia held the constellation to be a gathering point for Men's Law, Women's Law and Law of both sexes come together and consider matters of existence.

Corona Borealis was renamed Corona Firmiana in honour of the Archbishop of Salzburg in the 1730 Atlas "Mercurii Philosophicii Firmamentum Firminianum Descriptionem" by Corbinianus Thomas, but this was not taken up by subsequent cartographers. The constellation was featured as a main plot ingredient in the short story "<a href="Hypnos%20%28short%20story%29">Hypnos</a>" by <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, published in 1923; it is the object of fear of one of the protagonists in the short story. Finnish band <a href="Cadacross">Cadacross</a> released an album titled "<a href="Corona%20Borealis%20%28album%29">Corona Borealis</a>" in 2002.

Carolina Panthers

The Carolina Panthers are a professional <a href="American%20football">American football</a> team based in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. The Panthers compete in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL), as a member club of the league's <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC) <a href="NFC%20South">South</a> division. The team is headquartered in <a href="Bank%20of%20America%20Stadium">Bank of America Stadium</a> in <a href="Charlotte%20center%20city">uptown Charlotte</a>; also the team's <a href="Home%20%28sports%29">home field</a>. They are one of the few NFL teams to own the stadium they play in, which is legally registered as Panthers Stadium, LLC. The Panthers are supported throughout the <a href="The%20Carolinas">Carolinas</a>; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, it played home games at <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Clemson%29">Memorial Stadium</a> in <a href="Clemson%2C%20South%20Carolina">Clemson, South Carolina</a> during its first season. The team hosts its annual <a href="training%20camp">training camp</a> at <a href="Wofford%20College">Wofford College</a> in <a href="Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina">Spartanburg, South Carolina</a>. The head coach is <a href="Ron%20Rivera">Ron Rivera</a>.

The Panthers were announced as the league's 29th franchise in 1993, and began play in 1995 under original owner and founder <a href="Jerry%20Richardson">Jerry Richardson</a>. The Panthers played well in their first two years, finishing in 1995 (an all-time best for an NFL expansion team's first season) and 12–4 the following year, winning the <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> before ultimately losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the NFC Championship Game. They did not have another winning season until 2003, when they won the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> and reached <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a>, losing 32–29 to the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to record another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles. After losing in the divisional round to the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 2013 and the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> in 2014, the Panthers <a href="Super%20Bowl%2050">returned to the Super Bowl in 2015</a>, but lost to the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>. The Panthers have reached the playoffs seven times, advancing to four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls. They have won six division titles, one in the <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> and five in the <a href="NFC%20South">NFC South</a>.

The Carolina Panthers are legally registered as Panther Football, LLC. and are controlled by <a href="David%20Tepper">David Tepper</a>, whose purchase of the team from founder Jerry Richardson was unanimously approved by league owners on May 22, 2018. The club is worth approximately US$2.3 billion, according to "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>".

On December 15, 1987, entrepreneur <a href="Jerry%20Richardson">Jerry Richardson</a> announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in <a href="the%20Carolinas">the Carolinas</a>. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> who had used his <a href="1959%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1959</a> league championship bonus to co-found the <a href="Hardee%27s">Hardee's</a> restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of <a href="Trans%20World%20Corporation">TW Services</a>. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from <a href="George%20Shinn">George Shinn</a>, who had made a successful bid for an expansion <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) team in Charlotte, the <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a>. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, and a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be <a href="limited%20partnership">limited partners</a>. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing <a href="Charlotte%20center%20city">uptown Charlotte</a>.

To highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held preseason games around the area from 1989 to 1991. The first two games were held at <a href="Carter%E2%80%93Finley%20Stadium">Carter–Finley Stadium</a> in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Kenan%20Memorial%20Stadium">Kenan Memorial Stadium</a> in <a href="Chapel%20Hill%2C%20North%20Carolina">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>, while the third and final game was held at <a href="Williams-Brice%20Stadium">Williams-Brice Stadium</a> in <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia, South Carolina</a>. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 26, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously named the Carolina Panthers as the 29th member of the NFL.

The Panthers first competed in the <a href="1995%20NFL%20season">1995 NFL season</a>; they were one of two expansion teams to begin play that year, the other being the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. The Panthers were put in the <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> to increase the size of that division to five teams; there were already two other southeastern teams in the division, the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> and the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>. Former <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> defensive coordinator <a href="Dom%20Capers">Dom Capers</a> was named the first head coach. The team finished its inaugural season , the best performance ever from a first-year expansion team. They performed even better in their second season, finishing with a record and winning the NFC West division, as well as securing a first-round bye. The Panthers beat the defending Super Bowl champions <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> in the divisional round before losing the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> to the eventual <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> champions, the <a href="1996%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season">Green Bay Packers</a>. The team managed only a finish in <a href="1997%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">1997</a> and slipped to in <a href="1998%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">1998</a>, leading to Capers' dismissal as head coach.

The Panthers hired former <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> head coach <a href="George%20Seifert">George Seifert</a> to replace Capers, and he led the team to an record in <a href="1999%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">1999</a>. The team finished in <a href="2000%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2000</a> and fell to in <a href="2001%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2001</a>, winning their first game but losing their last 15. This performance tied the NFL record for most losses in a single season and it broke the record held by the winless <a href="1976%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season">1976 Buccaneers</a> for most consecutive losses in a single season (both records have since been broken by the <a href="2008%20Detroit%20Lions%20season">2008 Lions</a>), leading the Panthers to fire Seifert.

After the NFL's expansion to 32 teams in 2002, the Panthers were relocated from the NFC West to the newly created NFC South division. The Panthers' rivalries with the Falcons and Saints were maintained, and they would be joined by the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> defensive coordinator <a href="John%20Fox%20%28American%20football%29">John Fox</a> was hired to replace Seifert and led the team to a finish in 2002. Although the team's defense gave up very few yards, ranking the second-best in the NFL in yards conceded, they were hindered by an offense that ranked as the second-worst in the league in yards gained. The Panthers improved to in the <a href="2003%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2003 regular season</a>, winning the NFC South and making it to <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a> before losing to the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, 32–29, in what was immediately hailed by sportswriter <a href="Peter%20King%20%28sportswriter%29">Peter King</a> as the "Greatest Super Bowl of all time". King felt the game "was a wonderful championship battle, full of everything that makes football dramatic, draining, enervating, maddening, fantastic, exciting" and praised, among other things, the unpredictability, coaching, and conclusion. The game is still viewed as one of the best Super Bowls of all time, and in the opinion of Charlotte-based <a href="NPR">NPR</a> reporter Scott Jagow, the Panthers' Super Bowl appearance represented the arrival of Charlotte onto the national scene.

Following a start in 2004, the Panthers rebounded to win six of their last seven games despite losing 14 players for the season due to injury. They lost their last game to <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans</a>, finishing the <a href="2004%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2004 season</a> at . Had they won the game, the Panthers would have made the playoffs. The team improved to in <a href="2005%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2005</a>, finishing second in the division behind Tampa Bay and clinching a playoff berth as a <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild-card</a>. In the first round of the playoffs, the Panthers went on the road to face the New York Giants, beating them 23–0 for the NFL's first playoff <a href="shutout">shutout</a> against a home team since 1980. The following week, they beat <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago</a> 29–21 on the road, but lost key players <a href="Julius%20Peppers">Julius Peppers</a>, a <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a>, and <a href="DeShaun%20Foster">DeShaun Foster</a>, a <a href="running%20back">running back</a>, who were both injured during the game. The Panthers were then defeated 34–14 by the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> in the NFC Championship Game, ending their season. Although the Panthers went into the <a href="2006%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2006 season</a> as favorites to win the NFC South, they finished with a disappointing record. The team finished the <a href="2007%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2007 season</a> with a record after losing <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Jake%20Delhomme">Jake Delhomme</a> early in the season due to an elbow injury. In <a href="2008%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2008</a>, the Panthers rebounded with a regular season record, winning the NFC South and securing a first-round <a href="Bye%20%28sports%29">bye</a>. They were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs, losing 33–13 to the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIII">eventual NFC Champion</a> <a href="2008%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season">Arizona Cardinals</a> after Delhomme <a href="Turnover%20%28gridiron%20football%29">turned the ball over</a> six times. Delhomme's struggles carried over into the <a href="2009%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2009 season</a>, where he threw 18 interceptions in the first 11 games before breaking a finger in his throwing hand. The Panthers were at a record before Delhomme's season-ending injury, and his backup, <a href="Matt%20Moore%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Moore</a>, led the team to a finish to the season for an overall record.

In <a href="2010%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2010</a>, after releasing Delhomme in the offseason, the Panthers finished with a league-worst () record; their offense was the worst in the league. John Fox's contract expired after the season ended, and the team did not retain him or his staff.

The team hired <a href="Ron%20Rivera">Ron Rivera</a> to replace Fox as head coach and drafted <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn</a>'s <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>-winning quarterback <a href="Cam%20Newton">Cam Newton</a> with the first overall pick in the <a href="2011%20NFL%20Draft">2011 NFL Draft</a>. The Panthers opened the <a href="2011%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2011 season</a> , but finished with a record, and Newton was awarded the <a href="AP%20Offensive%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%23Offensive%20ROTY%20Winners%20%281967%E2%80%93present%29">AP Offensive Rookie of the Year</a> award after setting the NFL record for most rushing touchdowns from a quarterback (14) in a single season and becoming the first rookie NFL quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a single season. He also was the first rookie quarterback to rush for over 500 yards in a single season. In <a href="2012%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2012</a>, the Panthers again opened the season poorly, losing five out of their first six games, leading longtime general manager <a href="Marty%20Hurney">Marty Hurney</a> to be fired in response. The team slid to a record before winning five of their last six games, resulting in a record. This strong finish helped save Rivera's job. The Panthers had a winning season the following year, finishing with a record and winning their third NFC South title and another playoff bye, but they were beaten by the 49ers in the Divisional Round. In 2014, the Panthers opened the season with two wins, but after 12 games sat at due in part to a seven-game winless streak. A four-game winning streak to end the season secured the team their second consecutive NFC South championship and playoff berth, despite a losing record of . The Panthers defeated the <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>, 27–16, in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NFL%20playoffs">wild card round</a> to advance to the divisional playoffs, where they lost to eventual NFC champion Seattle, 31–17. The 2015 season saw the Panthers start the season and finish the season , which tied for the best regular-season record in NFC history. The Panthers also secured their third consecutive NFC South championship, as well as their first overall top-seeded playoff berth. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20NFL%20playoffs">2015–16 playoffs</a>, the Panthers defeated the <a href="2015%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season">Seattle Seahawks</a> in the NFC Divisional playoffs, 31–24, after shutting them out in the first half, 31–0, and the <a href="2015%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season">Arizona Cardinals</a>, 49–15, in the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> to advance to <a href="Super%20Bowl%2050">Super Bowl 50</a>, their first Super Bowl appearance since the <a href="2003%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2003 season</a>. The Panthers lost a defensive struggle to the AFC champion <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, 24–10.

In the <a href="2016%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2016 season</a>, the Panthers regressed on their 15–1 record from 2015, posting a 6–10 record and a last-place finish in the NFC South, missing the playoffs for the first time since <a href="2012%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2012</a>, and losing the division title to the second-seeded <a href="2016%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">Falcons</a>, who went on to represent the NFC in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a>.

In the <a href="2017%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2017 season</a>, the Panthers finished with an 11–5 record and a #5 seed and lost to the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> 31–26 in the Wild Card Round, their first loss in that round in franchise history.

On May 16, 2018, <a href="David%20Tepper">David Tepper</a>, formerly a minority owner of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, finalized an agreement to purchase the Panthers. The sale price was nearly $2.3 billion, a record. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. The sale officially closed on July 9, 2018. After starting 6-2, the Panthers finished the <a href="2018%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">2018 season</a> 7-9.

The shape of the Panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an "aggressive, contemporary look" as well to give it a more three-dimensional feel. The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular brow and fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the old design, which had teal on top of black.

By the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers' logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue, and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be "process blue" (a shade lighter than <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils">Duke</a>'s and darker than <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels">North Carolina</a>'s), was the most difficult color to choose.

The team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black. Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, said that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime.

The Panthers have three main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, designated their alternate uniforms, are the newest and were introduced in 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. Usually the Panthers opt for white or blue when the weather is expected to be hot and for black when the weather is expected to be cold.

The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.
The first such instance was in 1998, when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>. The second instance was in 2012 during a game against the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, when they paired their black jerseys with new black pants; this created an all-black uniform, with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets. The decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain <a href="Steve%20Smith%20Sr.">Steve Smith</a>, who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms. The all-black uniforms won the "Greatest Uniform in NFL History" contest, a fan-voted contest run by NFL.com in July 2013. In July 2013, the team's equipment manager, Jackie Miles, said the Panthers intended to use the all-black uniform more in the future. The Panthers wore the all-black uniform three times the following season, once each in the preseason and regular season, and the third time during the home divisional round playoff game vs the 49ers. During the Panthers' 2015 <a href="NFL%20on%20Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day game</a> against the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, they debuted an all-blue uniform as part of Nike's "Color Rush" series.

In the 2018 exhibition season, the Panthers wore the black pants with the blue jerseys for a home game vs. the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, then paired the black pants with the white jerseys in an away game vs. the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. During the 2018 season, the team did not wear silver pants. Instead they wore all-black uniforms and blue jerseys with white pants. 

The team's uniform did not change significantly after <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach <a href="Sam%20Mills">Sam Mills</a> by featuring the phrase "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying "When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!"

The Panthers played their first season at <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Clemson%29">Memorial Stadium</a> in <a href="Clemson%2C%20South%20Carolina">Clemson, South Carolina</a>, as their facility in uptown Charlotte was still under construction. Ericsson Stadium, called <a href="Bank%20of%20America%20Stadium">Bank of America Stadium</a> since 2004, opened in the summer of 1996.
Bank of America Stadium is owned entirely by the Panthers, making them one of the few teams in the NFL to own the facility they play in. The stadium was specially designed by <a href="Populous%20%28company%29">HOK Sports Facilities Group</a> for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the Panthers. On some days the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are some exceptions, and such tours must be arranged in advance.
Two bronze panther statues flank each of the stadium's three main entrances; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States. The names of the team's original PSL owners are engraved on the base of each statue. The two people in the Panthers Hall of Honor, team executive <a href="Mike%20McCormack%20%28American%20football%29">Mike McCormack</a> and <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Mills, in addition to being the only player in the Hall of Honor, is the only player to have had his jersey number (#51) <a href="Retired%20number">retired</a> by the Panthers .

The Panthers have three open-air fields next to Bank of America Stadium where they currently hold their practices; during the 1995 season, when the team played their home games in South Carolina, the team held their practices at <a href="Winthrop%20University">Winthrop University</a> in <a href="Rock%20Hill%2C%20South%20Carolina">Rock Hill, South Carolina</a>. Because the practice fields, along with the stadium, are located in uptown Charlotte, the fields are directly visible from skyscrapers as well as from a four-story condominium located across the street. According to Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers' division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building's top floor, and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the Panthers organization. In order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing, the team has added "strategically planted trees and a tarp over the ... fence surrounding the fields". Additionally, they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field. In the event of bad weather, the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about 10 miles from the stadium. The team does not own this facility. The Panthers have hosted their annual <a href="Training%20camp%20%28National%20Football%20League%29">training camp</a> at <a href="Wofford%20College">Wofford College</a> in <a href="Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina">Spartanburg, South Carolina</a>, since 1995.

The Panthers are supported in both North Carolina and South Carolina; <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina Governor</a> <a href="Nikki%20Haley">Nikki Haley</a> declared July 30, 2012, "Carolina Panthers Day" in her state, saying that "when it comes to professional teams, the Carolina Panthers are the team that South Carolina calls their own". During the 2016 NFC Championship and Super Bowl, the <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> #OneCarolina was used by college and professional sports teams from North Carolina and South Carolina to show unified support for the Panthers.

Pat Yasinskas of <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a> observed that while there is "a bit of a wine-and-cheese atmosphere at Panthers games ... there is a strong core of die-hard fans who bring energy to Bank of America Stadium. Charlotte lives and dies with the Panthers because there aren't a lot of other options in the sports world". "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" graded the Panthers as having the 10th highest "NFL Fan Value Experience" in 2007, attributing much of the fan atmosphere to the team's newness when compared to the established <a href="basketball">basketball</a> fanbase. They also observed that the stadium has scattered parking lots, each of which has a different <a href="Tailgate%20party">tailgating</a> style. Some have <a href="fried%20chicken">fried chicken</a>, <a href="pork">pork</a>, or <a href="Barbecue%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Carolinas">Carolina-style barbecue</a>, while others have live bands and televisions. Pickup football games in the parking lots are common, but fans tend to "behave themselves", in part due to <a href="blue%20law">blue law</a>s that prevent the sale of <a href="Alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> before noon on Sundays.

The Carolina Panthers have sold out all home games since December 2002, and their home attendance has ranked in the NFL's top ten since 2006.

<a href="Sir%20Purr">Sir Purr</a>, an <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> black cat who wears a jersey numbered '00', has been the Panthers' mascot since their first season. During games, Sir Purr provides sideline entertainment through skits and "silly antics". The mascot participates in a number of community events year-round, including a monthly visit to the patients at <a href="Levine%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Levine Children's Hospital</a>. Sir Purr also hosts the annual Mascot Bowl, an event which pits pro and college mascots against each other during halftime at a selected Panthers home game.

The team's <a href="cheerleader">cheerleader</a>s are the <a href="Carolina%20Topcats">Carolina Topcats</a>, a group of 24 women who lead cheers and entertain fans at home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. The team's <a href="drumline">drumline</a> is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.

Starting with the 2012 season, the Panthers introduced the Keep Pounding Drum, inspired by the aforementioned motivational speech by Sam Mills before the team's 2004 playoff game against the Cowboys. Prior to each home game, an honorary drummer hits the six-foot tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an American football game. According to the team, the drummers "come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations, but all have overcome a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger". Drummers have included current and former Panthers players, military veterans, <a href="Make-A-Wish%20Foundation">Make-A-Wish</a> children, and athletes from other sports, including <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">NBA MVP</a> and Charlotte native <a href="Stephen%20Curry">Stephen Curry</a>, <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">US women's national soccer team</a> players <a href="Whitney%20Engen">Whitney Engen</a> and <a href="Heather%20O%27Reilly">Heather O'Reilly</a>, and 7 time <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> <a href="Sprint%20Cup%20Series">Cup Series</a> champion <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>.

During the inaugural season of the Panthers, the team had an official <a href="fight%20song">fight song</a>, which the team played before each home game. The song, "Stand and Cheer", remains the team's official fight song, but the team does not typically play it before home games. Due to negative fan reaction "Stand and Cheer" was pulled in 1999. Since 2006, the song has returned. The team plays <a href="Neil%20Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>'s "<a href="Sweet%20Caroline">Sweet Caroline</a>" after home victories.
A "keep pounding" chant was introduced during the 2015 season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game. As prompted by the video boards, one side of the stadium shouts "keep" and the other side replies with "pounding". The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games.

The Carolina Panthers support a variety of non-profits in North and South Carolina through the Carolina Panthers Charities. Four annual scholarships are awarded to student athletes through the Carolina Panthers Graduate Scholarship and the Carolina Panthers Players Sam Mills Memorial Scholarship programs. Carolina Panthers Charities also offers grants to non-profits that support education, athletics, and human services in the community. The Panthers and Fisher Athletic has provided six equipment grants to high school football teams in the Carolinas each year since 2010. Carolina Panthers Charities raises funds at three annual benefits: the Countdown to Kickoff Luncheon, the team's first public event each season; Football 101, an educational workshop for fans; and the Weekend Warrior Flag Football Tournament, a two-day non-contact <a href="flag%20football">flag football</a> tournament. Another annual benefit is Taste of the Panthers, a gourmet food tasting which raises funds for Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina.

In 2003 the Panthers and Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Keep Pounding Fund, a fundraising initiative to support cancer research and patient support programs. The Panthers community has raised more than $1.4 million for the fund through direct donations, charity auctions, blood drives, and an annual 5k stadium run. The Panthers and <a href="Levine%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Levine Children's Hospital</a> coordinate monthly hospital visits and VIP game-day experiences for terminally ill or hospitalized children.

In addition to these team-specific efforts, the Panthers participate in a number of regular initiatives promoted by the NFL and <a href="USA%20Football">USA Football</a>, the league's youth football development partner. These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league's <a href="Breast%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a> program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support military families and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.

Jaime Moreno provides the play-by-play while his nephew, Luis Moreno Jr., is the color commentator. They have become popular even among English-speaking Panther fans for their high-energy, colorful announcing style.

The Panthers have developed heated rivalries with the three fellow members of the NFC South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints). The team's fiercest rivals are the Falcons and Buccaneers.

The Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only 230 miles (370 kilometers) south on <a href="Interstate%2085">I-85</a>. The two teams have played each other twice a year since the Panthers' inception, and games between the two teams feature large contingents of Panthers fans at Atlanta's <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium">Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a> and large contingents of Falcons fans at Bank of America Stadium.

The Panthers' rivalry with Tampa Bay has been described as the most intense in the NFC South. The rivalry originated in 2002 with the formation of the NFC South, but became particularly heated before the 2003 season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as "one of the most physical contests in recent memory". The rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams, some of which were caused by foul play. One of these plays, an illegal hit on Tampa Bay punt returner <a href="Clifton%20Smith%20%28return%20specialist%29">Clifton Smith</a>, sparked a brief melee between the teams in 2009.

During their time in the NFC West, the Panthers began developing a rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers. This rivalry faded after the NFL moved the Panthers out of the NFC West.

A relatively new rivalry, this one dates to the <a href="2005%20NFL%20season">2005</a> <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a>, in which the Seahawks won the game 31–14. The rivalry started up again in 2012, when the Panthers lost a close regular season home game to a <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> team led by rookie quarterback <a href="Russell%20Wilson">Russell Wilson</a>, 16–12. In the 2013 season, the Panthers opened the season at home versus Seattle. They again lost a close game, with the final score 12–7. The Seahawks would go on to win <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII">Super Bowl XLVIII</a>. In the 2014 season, once more at Bank of America Stadium, the Seahawks defeated the Panthers in week eight, 13–9. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle in Seattle, notorious for being a tough opposing field to play in, and lost 31–17. The Seahawks would go on to lose <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIX">Super Bowl XLIX</a>. In the 2015 season the next year, the teams faced off in Seattle, where the Panthers won another close game, 27–23. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle at Bank of America stadium, where they had yet to beat a Russell Wilson-led Seahawks team. By halftime they led 31–0, but the Seahawks rebounded and scored 24 unanswered points before the Panthers were able to seal the victory, 31–24. The Panthers would go on to lose <a href="Super%20Bowl%2050">Super Bowl 50</a>. In the 2016 season, the teams met in Seattle, where the Panthers were beaten, 40–7. The teams did not face each other during the 2017 season. In the 2018 season, the Panthers were defeated by the Seahawks at home by a score of 30–27. Since the 2012 season, Carolina is overall against Seattle and in the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">playoffs</a>. The rivalry aspect stems from how close the majority of the matches have been and the fact that they have played each other eight times between 2012 and 2018—at least once a year.

The Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor was established in 1997 to honor individuals for their contributions to the Carolina Panthers organization. Each inductee is honored with a life-sized bronze statue outside of Bank of America Stadium's North Entrance, while the names of each original PSL owner are written on the black granite base at each of the six panther statues. A rule added in the mid-2000s by the Panthers organization requires all potential inductees to be retired for at least five years before they are eligible for induction.

Nominees for the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, which "honor[s] individuals who have made outstanding contributions to professional football", are determined by a 46-member selection committee. At least 80% of voters must approve the nominee for him to be inducted.

Jerry Richardson was the founder and original owner of the Carolina Panthers. Richardson and his family owned about 48% of the team, with the remaining 52% owned by a group of 14 limited partners. Richardson and the other investors paid $206 million for the rights to start the team in 1993.

Mike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and former coach and executive for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers' first team president, presiding in that role from 1994 until his retirement in 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson's son, Mark, was appointed as the team's second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by <a href="Danny%20Morrison%20%28sports%20executive%29">Danny Morrison</a>, who had previously served as the athletic director of both <a href="Texas%20Christian%20University">Texas Christian University</a> and <a href="Wofford%20College">Wofford College</a>, Richardson's alma mater.

On May 16, 2018, <a href="David%20Tepper">David Tepper</a>, formerly a minority owner of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, finalized an agreement to purchase the Carolina Panthers, for nearly $2.3 billion, a record at the time. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. According to "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>", the Panthers are worth approximately $2.3 billion . They ranked the Carolina Panthers as the 21st-most valuable NFL team and the 36th-most valuable sports team in the world.

The Carolina Panthers have had four head coaches. Dom Capers was the head coach from 1995 to 1998 and led the team to one playoff appearance. Counting playoff games, he finished with a record of 31–35 (.470). George Seifert coached the team from 1999 to 2001, recording 16 wins and 32 losses (.333); he is the only head coach in team history not to have led the team to a playoff appearance. John Fox, the team's longest-tenured head coach, led the team from 2002 to 2010 and coached the team to three playoff appearances including <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a> which the Panthers lost. Including playoff games, Fox ended his tenure with a 78–74 (.513) record, making him the only Panthers coach to finish his tenure with the team with a winning record. Ron Rivera, the team's current head coach, has held the position since 2011 and has led the team to three playoff appearances including <a href="Super%20Bowl%2050">Super Bowl 50</a> which the Panthers also lost. Counting playoff games, he has a career record of 67–51–1 (.567). Statistically, Rivera has the highest winning percentage of any Panthers head coach.

Since they began playing football in 1995, the Panthers have been to four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: the NFC West championship in 1996 and the NFC South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They are the first and only team to win the NFC South back to back and have won the NFC South more times than any other team in the division. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in the NFC West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in the NFC South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. They have qualified for the playoffs 8 times, most recently in 2017.

<a href="Placekicker">Kicker</a> <a href="John%20Kasay">John Kasay</a> is the team's career points leader. Kasay scored 1,482 points during his 16 seasons (1995–2010) with the Panthers. Quarterback <a href="Cam%20Newton">Cam Newton</a>, who has played for the Panthers since 2011, is the career passing leader, having thrown for 20,257 yards over his six seasons with the team. Running back <a href="Jonathan%20Stewart">Jonathan Stewart</a> is the career rushing leader for the Carolina Panthers. Stewart, during his tenure with the team (2008–2018), rushed for 6,868 yards with the Panthers. Wide receiver Steve Smith, the team's leading receiver, recorded 12,197 receiving yards during his 13-year (2001–2013) tenure with the team.

It is a member of the genus "<a href="Rhinella">Rhinella</a>", but was formerly in the genus "<a href="Bufo">Bufo</a>", which includes many different true toad <a href="species">species</a> found throughout Central and South America. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump <a href="spawn%20%28biology%29">spawns</a> with thousands of <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among <a href="Frog">anurans</a>, of both dead and living matter. Adults average in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of .

The cane toad is an old species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the <a href="La%20Venta%20%28Colombia%29">La Venta fauna</a> of the late <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the "R. marina" habitat preferences have long been for open areas.

The cane toad has poison <a href="gland">gland</a>s, and the <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>s are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>. The species derives its common name from its use against the <a href="cane%20beetle">cane beetle</a> ("Dermolepida albohirtum"). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.

Historically, the cane toads were used to eradicate pests from <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, giving rise to their common name. The cane toad has many other common names, including "giant toad" and "marine toad"; the former refers to its size, and the latter to the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a>, "R. marina". It was one of many species described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th-century work "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" (1758). Linnaeus based the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "marina" on an illustration by Dutch zoologist <a href="Albertus%20Seba">Albertus Seba</a>, who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments. Other common names include "giant neotropical toad", "Dominican toad", "giant marine toad", and "South American cane toad". In <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>ian English, they are commonly called "crapaud", the French word for toad.

The genus "Rhinella" is considered to constitute a distinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of its own, thus changing the <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> of the cane toad. In this case, the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "marinus" (<a href="Grammatical%20gender">masculine</a>) changes to "marina" (feminine) to conform with the rules of gender agreement as set out by the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a>, changing the binomial name from "Bufo marinus" to "Rhinella marina"; the binomial "Rhinella marinus" was subsequently introduced as a synonym through misspelling by Pramuk, Robertson, Sites, and Noonan (2008). Though controversial (with many traditional herpetologists still using "Bufo marinus") the binomial "Rhinella marina" is gaining in acceptance with such bodies as the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, <a href="Encyclopaedia%20of%20Life">Encyclopaedia of Life</a>, Amphibian Species of the World and increasing numbers of scientific publications adopting its usage.
In Australia, the adults may be confused with large native frogs from the genera "<a href="Limnodynastes">Limnodynastes</a>", "<a href="Cyclorana">Cyclorana</a>", and "<a href="Barred%20frogs">Mixophyes</a>". These species can be distinguished from the cane toad by the absence of large <a href="parotoid%20gland">parotoid gland</a>s behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the <a href="giant%20burrowing%20frog">giant burrowing frog</a> ("Heleioporus australiacus"), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. Juvenile cane toads may be confused with species of the genus "<a href="Uperoleia">Uperoleia</a>", but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.

In the United States, the cane toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, it could be confused with the <a href="southern%20toad">southern toad</a> ("Bufo terrestris"), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.

The cane toad genome has been sequenced.

The cane toad is very large; the females are significantly longer than males, reaching a typical length of , with a maximum of . Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density. They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years in the wild, and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35 years.

The skin of the cane toad is dry and warty. It has distinct ridges above the eyes, which run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.

Typically, juvenile cane toads have smooth, dark skin, although some specimens have a red wash. Juveniles lack the adults' large parotoid glands, so they are usually less poisonous. The <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>s are small and uniformly black, and are bottom-dwellers, tending to form <a href="Swarm">schools</a>. Tadpoles range from in length.

The common name "marine toad" and the scientific name "Rhinella marina" suggest a link to <a href="marine%20biology">marine life</a>, but cane toads do not live in the sea. However, laboratory experiments suggest that <a href="tadpoles">tadpoles</a> can tolerate salt concentrations equivalent to 15% of <a href="seawater">seawater</a> (~5.4‰), and recent field observations found living tadpoles and toadlets at salinities of 27.5‰ on <a href="Coiba%20Island">Coiba Island</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. The cane toad inhabits open grassland and woodland, and has displayed a "distinct preference" for areas modified by humans, such as gardens and drainage ditches. In their native habitats, the toads can be found in subtropical forests, although dense foliage tends to limit their dispersal.

The cane toad begins life as an egg, which is laid as part of long strings of jelly in water. A female lays 8,000–25,000 eggs at once and the strings can stretch up to in length. The black eggs are covered by a membrane and their diameter is about . The rate at which an egg grows into a tadpole increases with temperature. Tadpoles typically hatch within 48 hours, but the period can vary from 14 hours to almost a week. This process usually involves thousands of tadpoles—which are small, black, and have short tails—forming into groups. Between 12 and 60 days are needed for the tadpoles to develop into juveniles, with four weeks being typical. Similarly to their adult counterparts, eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals.

When they emerge, toadlets typically are about in length, and grow rapidly. While the rate of growth varies by region, time of year, and gender, an average initial growth rate of per day is seen, followed by an average rate of per day. Growth typically slows once the toads reach sexual maturity. This rapid growth is important for their survival; in the period between metamorphosis and subadulthood, the young toads lose the toxicity that protected them as eggs and tadpoles, but have yet to fully develop the parotoid glands that produce <a href="bufotoxin">bufotoxin</a>. Because they lack this key defence, only an estimated 0.5% of cane toads reach adulthood.

As with rates of growth, the point at which the toads become sexually mature varies across different regions. In New Guinea, sexual maturity is reached by female toads with a snout–vent length between , while toads in <a href="Panama">Panama</a> achieve maturity when they are between in length. In tropical regions, such as their native habitats, breeding occurs throughout the year, but in subtropical areas, breeding occurs only during warmer periods that coincide with the onset of the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>.

The cane toad is estimated to have a critical thermal maximum of and a minimum of around . The ranges can change due to adaptation to the local environment. The cane toad has a high tolerance to water loss; some can withstand a 52.6% loss of body water, allowing them to survive outside tropical environments.

Most frogs identify prey by movement, and vision appears to be the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, it can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, other <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, <a href="bird">bird</a>s, and even <a href="bat">bat</a>s and a range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.

The skin of the adult cane toad is toxic, as well as the enlarged parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across its back. When the toad is threatened, its glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as <a href="bufotoxin">bufotoxin</a>. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.

<a href="Bufotenin">Bufotenin</a>, one of the chemicals excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside <a href="heroin">heroin</a> and <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>. The effects of bufotenin are thought to be similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s, lasts less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, <a href="Psychoactive%20toad">toad licking</a> could result in serious illness or death.

In addition to releasing toxin, the cane toad is capable of inflating its lungs, puffing up, and lifting its body off the ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator.

Since 2011, experimenters in the Kimberley region of Western Australia have used poisonous sausages containing toad meat to try to protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, along with the University of Sydney, developed baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals to stay away from the amphibians.

Many species prey on the cane toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, including the <a href="broad-snouted%20caiman">broad-snouted caiman</a> ("Caiman latirostris"), the <a href="banded%20cat-eyed%20snake">banded cat-eyed snake</a> ("Leptodeira annulata"), eels (family <a href="Anguillidae">Anguillidae</a>), various species of <a href="killifish">killifish</a>, the rock flagtail ("<a href="Kuhlia">Kuhlia</a> rupestris"), some species of <a href="catfish">catfish</a> (order Siluriformes), some species of <a href="ibis">ibis</a> (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and "<a href="Paraponera%20clavata">Paraponera clavata</a>" (bullet ants). Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the <a href="whistling%20kite">whistling kite</a> ("Haliastur sphenurus"), the <a href="rakali">rakali</a> ("Hydromys chrysogaster"), the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus") and the <a href="Asian%20water%20monitor">water monitor</a> ("Varanus salvator"). The <a href="tawny%20frogmouth">tawny frogmouth</a> ("Podargus strigoides") and the <a href="Papuan%20frogmouth">Papuan frogmouth</a> ("Podargus papuensis") have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows ("<a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">Corvus</a>" spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their backs. Opossums of the genus "<a href="Didelphis">Didelphis</a>" likely can eat cane toads with impunity. <a href="Meat%20ant">Meat ant</a>s are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, so are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad.

The cane toad is native to the Americas, and its range stretches from the <a href="Rio%20Grande%20Valley">Rio Grande Valley</a> in <a href="South%20Texas">South Texas</a> to the central <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon</a> and southeastern <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, and some of the continental islands near <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> (such as <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a>). This area encompasses both <a href="tropics">tropical</a> and <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semiarid</a> environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100 m (109 yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.

The cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the world—particularly the Pacific—for the biological control of agricultural pests. These introductions have generally been well documented, and the cane toad may be one of the most studied of any introduced species.

Before the early 1840s, the cane toad had been introduced into <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, from <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>. An introduction to <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> was made in 1844 in an attempt to reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.

As a result, many countries in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. Introduced populations are in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the <a href="Ogasawara%20Islands">Ogasawara</a>, <a href="Ishigaki%20Island">Ishigaki Island</a> and the <a href="Dait%C5%8D%20Islands">Daitō Islands</a> of Japan, most Caribbean islands, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> and many other Pacific islands, including <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses a serious threat to native animals.

Following the apparent success of the cane toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad to be released in Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome, Western Australia</a>.

However, the toad was generally unsuccessful in reducing the targeted grey-backed cane beetles ("<a href="Dermolepida%20albohirtum">Dermolepida albohirtum</a>"), in part because the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, in part because the beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the <a href="Monitor%20lizard">varanid</a> lizards "<a href="Varanus%20mertensi">Varanus mertensi</a>", "<a href="Varanus%20mitchelli">V. mitchelli</a>", and "<a href="Varanus%20panoptes">V. panoptes</a>", the land snakes "<a href="Pseudechis%20australis">Pseudechis australis</a>" and "<a href="Acanthophis%20antarcticus">Acanthophis antarcticus</a>", and the crocodile species "<a href="Freshwater%20crocodile">Crocodylus johnstoni</a>"; in contrast, the population of the <a href="agamidae">agamid</a> lizard "<a href="Amphibolurus%20gilberti">Amphibolurus gilberti</a>"—known to be a prey item of "V. panoptes"—has increased.

The cane toad was introduced to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While it was able to establish itself on some islands, such as <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, other introductions, such as in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a> and <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>, were unsuccessful.

The earliest recorded introductions were to Barbados and <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>. The Barbados introductions were focused on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> and <a href="mole%20cricket">mole cricket</a> populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no significant effect on the rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>—possibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date— and <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the <a href="Soufri%C3%A8re%20Hills">Soufrière Hills volcano</a> eruption in 1995.

In 1920, the cane toad was introduced into Puerto Rico to control the populations of <a href="Phyllophaga%20%28genus%29">white grub</a> ("Phyllophaga" spp.), a sugarcane pest. Before this, the pests were manually collected by humans, so the introduction of the toad eliminated labor costs. A second group of toads was imported in 1923, and by 1932, the cane toad was well established. The population of white grubs dramatically decreased, and this was attributed to the cane toad at the annual meeting of the International Sugar Cane Technologists in Puerto Rico. However, there may have been other factors. The six-year period after 1931—when the cane toad was most prolific, and the white grub had a dramatic decline—had the highest-ever rainfall for Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, the cane toad was assumed to have controlled the white grub; this view was reinforced by a "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" article titled "Toads save sugar crop", and this led to large-scale introductions throughout many parts of the Pacific.

The cane toad has been spotted in <a href="Carriacou">Carriacou</a> and <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>, the latter appearance occurring in spite of the failure of the earlier introductions. On September 8, 2013, the cane toad was also discovered on the island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> in the Bahamas.

The cane toad was first introduced deliberately into the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in 1930 as a biological control agent of pests in sugarcane plantations, after the success of the experimental introductions into Puerto Rico. It subsequently became the most ubiquitous amphibian in the islands. It still retains the common name of "bakî" or "kamprag" in the <a href="Visayan%20languages">Visayan languages</a>, a <a href="Corruption%20%28linguistics%29">corruption</a> of 'American frog', referring to its origins. It is also commonly known as "bullfrog" in Philippine English.

The cane toad was introduced into <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations. The introduction of the cane toad to the region was first suggested in 1933, following the successes in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawaii. Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded, as the toad's diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered "economically neutral". Today, the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions.

The cane toad was introduced into <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> to control the <a href="hawk%20moth">hawk moth</a> larvae eating <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a> crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawaii, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of toads being used for human <a href="pregnancy%20test">pregnancy test</a>s—many species of toad were found to be effective for this task, and were employed for about 20 years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of <a href="cutworm">cutworm</a>s and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a>, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.

The cane toad naturally exists in <a href="South%20Texas">South Texas</a>, but attempts (both deliberate and accidental) have been made to introduce the species to other parts of the country. These include introductions to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and to the islands of Hawaii, as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.

Initial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, intended to control sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way. However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a> in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida. Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Keys</a> to north of <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>, and they are gradually extending further northward. In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to native species and pets; so much so, the <a href="Florida%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Commission">Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission</a> recommends residents to kill them.

Around 150 cane toads were introduced to <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a> in Hawaii in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17 months. The toads were sent to the other islands, and more than 100,000 toads were distributed by July 1934; eventually over 600,000 were transported.

Other than the use as a <a href="Biological%20pest%20control">biological control for pests</a>, the cane toad has been employed in a number of commercial and noncommercial applications. Traditionally, within the toad's natural range in South America, the <a href="Embera-Wounaan">Embera-Wounaan</a> would "milk" the toads for their toxin, which was then employed as an <a href="arrow%20poison">arrow poison</a>. The toxins may have been used as an <a href="entheogen">entheogen</a> by the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> people. The toad has been hunted as a food source in parts of <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, and eaten after the careful removal of the skin and <a href="parotoid%20gland">parotoid gland</a>s. When properly prepared, the meat of the toad is considered healthy and as a source of <a href="omega-3%20fatty%20acid">omega-3 fatty acid</a>s. More recently, the toad's toxins have been used in a number of new ways: <a href="bufotenin">bufotenin</a> has been used in Japan as an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a> and a <a href="Baldness%20treatments">hair restorer</a>, and in <a href="cardiac%20surgery">cardiac surgery</a> in China to lower the heart rates of patients. New research has suggested that the cane toad's poison may have some applications in treating <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>.

Other modern applications of the cane toad include pregnancy testing, as pets, laboratory research, and the production of <a href="leather">leather</a> goods. <a href="Pregnancy%20test">Pregnancy test</a>ing was conducted in the mid-20th century by injecting urine from a woman into a male toad's <a href="Lymphatic%20system">lymph sacs</a>, and if <a href="spermatozoa">spermatozoa</a> appeared in the toad's urine, the patient was deemed to be pregnant. The tests using toads were faster than <a href="Rabbit%20test">those employing mammals</a>; the toads were easier to raise, and, although the initial 1948 discovery employed "<a href="Bufo%20arenarum">Bufo arenarum</a>" for the tests, it soon became clear that a variety of <a href="Frog">anuran</a> species were suitable, including the cane toad. As a result, toads were employed in this task for around 20 years. As a <a href="Animal%20testing">laboratory animal</a>, the cane toad is regarded as ideal; they are plentiful, and easy and inexpensive to maintain and handle. The use of the cane toad in experiments started in the 1950s, and by the end of the 1960s, large numbers were being collected and exported to high schools and universities. Since then, a number of Australian states have introduced or tightened importation regulations. Even dead toads have value. Cane toad skin has been made into leather and novelty items; stuffed cane toads, posed and accessorised, have found a home in the tourist market, and attempts have been made to produce <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a> from their bodies.

Cane toads pose a serious threat to native species when introduced to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, multiple reports exist of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is <a href="Cane%20toads%20in%20Australia">Australia</a>, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the <a href="northern%20quoll">northern quoll</a>, as well as <a href="Mertens%27%20water%20monitor">Mertens' water monitor</a>, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.

Two sites were chosen to study the effects of cane toads on the northern quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of <a href="Kakadu%20National%20Park">Kakadu National Park</a>. The other site was located at the north end of the park. In addition to these two sites, a third site was located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as no northern quolls were caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site were found that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious evidence that supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a> of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.

In the case of <a href="Mertens%27%20water%20monitor">Mertens' water monitor</a>, only one region was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 km south of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, at the Manton Dam Recreation Area. Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, 14 sites were set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for 4 weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per day for 2 consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each site visit occurred between 7:30 and 10:30 am, and 4:00–7:00 pm, when "Varanus mertensi" can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and had a total of 194 sightings of "Varanus mertensi" in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, 2 months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next four surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, only two "V. mertensi" lizards were observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the water monitor abundance was at its highest over the course of the study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When compared, the two populations side by side clearly show that the onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the monitors, as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area. At the end of the study, some scattered populations of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.

Cottingley Fairies

The Cottingley Fairies appear in a series of five <a href="photograph">photograph</a>s taken by Elsie Wright (1901–1988) and Frances Griffiths (1907–1986), two young cousins who lived in <a href="Cottingley%2C%20Bradford">Cottingley</a>, near <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures came to the attention of writer <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, who used them to illustrate an article on <a href="fairy">fairies</a> he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of "<a href="Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>". Doyle, as a <a href="Spiritualism%20%28religious%20movement%29">spiritualist</a>, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of <a href="psychic">psychic</a> phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, others believed that they had been faked.

Interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921. Both girls married and lived abroad for a time after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper traced Elsie, who had by then returned to the UK. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.

In the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs and two of the cameras used are on display in the <a href="National%20Science%20and%20Media%20Museum">National Science and Media Museum</a> in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, England.

In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of <a href="Cottingley%2C%20Bradford">Cottingley</a> in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg <a href="Film%20format%23Still%20photography%20film%20formats">quarter-plate</a>. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, "triumphant".

Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a> he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be "nothing but a prank", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.

Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote "It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there."

The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a> in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on "fairy life", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker. As a result, the photographs were displayed at the society's annual conference in <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>, held a few months later. There they came to the attention of a leading member of the society, Edward Gardner. One of the central beliefs of theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution, towards increasing "perfection", and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement:
Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert. Snelling's opinion was that "the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs ... [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models". He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that "these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time". Gardner had the prints "clarified" by Snelling, and new negatives produced, "more conducive to printing", for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around the UK. Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner's lectures.
Author and prominent <a href="Spiritualism%20%28religious%20movement%29">spiritualist</a> <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> learned of the photographs from the editor of the spiritualist publication "Light". Doyle had been commissioned by "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>" to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs "must have seemed like a godsend" according to broadcaster and historian <a href="Magnus%20Magnusson">Magnus Magnusson</a>. Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was "obviously impressed" that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be "soiled" by money.

Gardner and Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Kodak</a>. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures "showed no signs of being faked", they concluded that "this could not be taken as conclusive evidence ... that they were authentic photographs of fairies". Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity. Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented "after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow". The prints were also examined by another photographic company, <a href="Ilford%20Photo">Ilford</a>, who reported unequivocally that there was "some evidence of faking". Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.

Doyle also showed the photographs to the <a href="physicist">physicist</a> and pioneering <a href="parapsychology">psychical researcher</a> <a href="Sir%20Oliver%20Lodge">Sir Oliver Lodge</a>, who believed the photographs to be fake. He suggested that a troupe of dancers had masqueraded as fairies, and expressed doubt as to their "distinctly 'Parisienne hairstyles.

On October 4, 2018 the first two of the photographs, "Alice and the Fairies" and "Iris and the Gnome," were to be sold by Dominic Winter Auctioneers, in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. The prints, suspected to have been made in 1920 to sell at <a href="Theosophy%20%28Boehmian%29">theosophical</a> lectures, were expected to bring £700-£1000 each.

Doyle was preoccupied with organising an imminent lecture tour of Australia, and in July 1920, sent Gardner to meet the Wright family. Frances was by then living with her parents in <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>, but Elsie's father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck (stream), looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts, but found nothing "incriminating".
Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs' authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two Kodak Cameo cameras and 24 secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies. Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 "Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies":

Until 19 August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, "Frances and the Leaping Fairy", Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, "Fairy offering Posy of <a href="Campanula%20rotundifolia">Harebells</a> to Elsie", shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, "Fairies and Their Sun-Bath".

The plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London, who sent an "ecstatic" telegram to Doyle, by then in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Doyle wrote back:

Doyle's article in the December 1920 issue of "The Strand" contained two higher-resolution prints of the 1917 photographs, and sold out within days of publication. To protect the girls' anonymity, Frances and Elsie were called Alice and Iris respectively, and the Wright family was referred to as the "Carpenters". An enthusiastic and committed spiritualist, Doyle hoped that if the photographs convinced the public of the existence of fairies then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena. He ended his article with the words:

Early press coverage was "mixed", generally a combination of "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet <a href="Maurice%20Hewlett">Maurice Hewlett</a> published a series of articles in the literary journal "John O' London's Weekly", in which he concluded: "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." The Sydney newspaper "<a href="Truth%20%28Sydney%20newspaper%29">Truth</a>" on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." Some public figures were more sympathetic. <a href="Margaret%20McMillan">Margaret McMillan</a>, the educational and social reformer, wrote: "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." The novelist <a href="Henry%20De%20Vere%20Stacpoole">Henry De Vere Stacpoole</a> decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: "Look at Alice's [Frances'] face. Look at Iris's [Elsie's] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10 million faces and forms – it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it."

<a href="John%20Hall-Edwards">Major John Hall-Edwards</a>, a keen photographer and pioneer of <a href="X-ray%23Medical%20uses">medical X-ray treatments</a> in Britain, was a particularly vigorous critic:

Doyle used the later photographs in 1921 to illustrate a second article in "The Strand", in which he described other accounts of fairy sightings. The article formed the foundation for his 1922 book "The Coming of the Fairies". As before, the photographs were received with mixed credulity. Sceptics noted that the fairies "looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales" and that they had "very fashionable hairstyles".

Gardner made a final visit to Cottingley in August 1921. He again brought cameras and photographic plates for Frances and Elsie, but was accompanied by the clairvoyant <a href="Geoffrey%20Hodson">Geoffrey Hodson</a>. Although neither of the girls claimed to see any fairies, and there were no more photographs, "on the contrary, he [Hodson] saw them [fairies] everywhere" and wrote voluminous notes on his observations.

By now Elsie and Frances were tired of the whole fairy business. Years later Elsie looked at a photograph of herself and Frances taken with Hodson and said: "Look at that, fed up with fairies." Both Elsie and Frances later admitted that they "played along" with Hodson "out of mischief", and that they considered him "a fake".

Public interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years. In 1966, a reporter from the "Daily Express" newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been "figments of my imagination", but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts. The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie's photographs once again. <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television's "<a href="Nationwide%20%28TV%20series%29">Nationwide</a>" programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie stuck to her story: "I've told you that they're photographs of figments of our imagination, and that's what I'm sticking to".

Elsie and Frances were interviewed by journalist <a href="Austin%20Mitchell">Austin Mitchell</a> in September 1976, for a programme broadcast on <a href="Yorkshire%20Television">Yorkshire Television</a>. When pressed, both women agreed that "a rational person doesn't see fairies", but they denied having fabricated the photographs. In 1978 the magician and <a href="scientific%20skepticism">scientific sceptic</a> <a href="James%20Randi">James Randi</a> and a team from the <a href="Committee%20for%20the%20Scientific%20Investigation%20of%20Claims%20of%20the%20Paranormal">Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal</a> examined the photographs, using a "computer enhancement process". They concluded that the photographs were fakes, and that strings could be seen supporting the fairies. <a href="Geoffrey%20Crawley">Geoffrey Crawley</a>, editor of the "<a href="British%20Journal%20of%20Photography">British Journal of Photography</a>", undertook a "major scientific investigation of the photographs and the events surrounding them", published between 1982 and 1983, "the first major postwar analysis of the affair". He also concluded that the pictures were fakes.

In 1983, the cousins admitted in an article published in the magazine "<a href="The%20Unexplained%20%28magazine%29">The Unexplained</a>" that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children's book of the time, "Princess Mary's Gift Book", published in 1914, and drew wings on them. They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with <a href="hatpin">hatpin</a>s, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken. But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his "The Coming of the Fairies" described in this way:

Elsie maintained it was a fake, just like all the others, but Frances insisted that it was genuine. In an interview given in the early 1980s Frances said:

Both Frances and Elsie claimed to have taken the fifth photograph. In a letter published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" newspaper on 9 April 1983, Geoffrey Crawley explained the discrepancy by suggesting that the photograph was "an unintended double exposure of fairy cutouts in the grass", and thus "both ladies can be quite sincere in believing that they each took it".

In a 1985 interview on <a href="Yorkshire%20Television">Yorkshire Television</a>'s "<a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke%27s%20World%20of%20Strange%20Powers">Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers</a>", Elsie said that she and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>: "Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well, we could only keep quiet." In the same interview Frances said: "I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in – they wanted to be taken in."

Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints of their photographs of the fairies, along with a few other items including a first edition of Doyle's book "The Coming of the Fairies", were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the <a href="National%20Science%20and%20Media%20Museum">National Science and Media Museum</a>), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.
The glass photographic plates were bought for £6,000 by an unnamed buyer at a London auction held in 2001.

Frances' daughter, Christine Lynch, appeared in an episode of the television programme "<a href="Antiques%20Roadshow">Antiques Roadshow</a>" in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> in January 2009, with the photographs and one of the cameras given to the girls by Doyle. Christine told the expert, <a href="Paul%20Atterbury">Paul Atterbury</a>, that she believed, as her mother had done, that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine. Atterbury estimated the value of the items at between £25,000 and £30,000. The first edition of Frances' memoirs was published a few months later, under the title "Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies". The book contains correspondence, sometimes "bitter", between Elsie and Frances. In one letter, dated 1983, Frances wrote:
The 1997 films "" and "<a href="Photographing%20Fairies">Photographing Fairies</a>" were inspired by the events surrounding the Cottingley Fairies. The photographs were parodied in a 1994 book written by <a href="Terry%20Jones">Terry Jones</a> and <a href="Brian%20Froud">Brian Froud</a>, "Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book".

In 2017 a further two fairy photographs were presented as evidence that the girls' parents were part of the conspiracy. Dating from 1917 and 1918, both photographs are poorly executed copies of two of the original fairy photographs. One was published in 1918 in "<a href="The%20Sphere%20%28newspaper%29">The Sphere</a>" newspaper, which was before the originals had been seen by anyone outside the girls' immediate family.

<doc id="6778" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6778" title="Ceawlin of Wessex">
Ceawlin of Wessex

Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin, died "ca." 593) was a <a href="King%20of%20Wessex">King of Wessex</a>. He may have been the son of <a href="Cynric%20of%20Wessex">Cynric of Wessex</a> and the grandson of <a href="Cerdic%20of%20Wessex">Cerdic of Wessex</a>, whom the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" represents as the leader of the first group of <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a> to come to the land which later became <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native <a href="Britons%20%28historic%29">Britons</a> by the time of his death.

The chronology of Ceawlin's life is highly uncertain. The historical accuracy and dating of many of the events in the later "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" have been called into question, and his reign is variously listed as lasting seven, seventeen, or thirty-two years. The "Chronicle" records several battles of Ceawlin's between the years 556 and 592, including the first record of a battle between different groups of Anglo-Saxons, and indicates that under Ceawlin Wessex acquired significant territory, some of which was later to be lost to other <a href="Heptarchy">Anglo-Saxon kingdoms</a>. Ceawlin is also named as one of the eight ""<a href="bretwalda">bretwalda</a>s"", a title given in the "Chronicle" to eight rulers who had overlordship over southern Britain, although the extent of Ceawlin's control is not known.

Ceawlin died in 593, having been deposed the year before, possibly by his successor, <a href="Ceol%20of%20Wessex">Ceol</a>. He is recorded in various sources as having two sons, Cutha and <a href="Cuthwine">Cuthwine</a>, but the genealogies in which this information is found are known to be unreliable.

The history of the <a href="sub-Roman%20Britain">sub-Roman period in Britain</a> is poorly sourced and the subject of a number of important disagreements among historians. It appears, however, that in the fifth century raids on Britain by continental peoples developed into migrations. The newcomers included <a href="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a>, and <a href="Frisii">Frisians</a>. These peoples captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of <a href="Mons%20Badonicus">Mons Badonicus</a> halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years. Near the year 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years, it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.

The peace following the battle of Mons Badonicus is attested partly by <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>, a monk, who wrote "<a href="De%20Excidio%20et%20Conquestu%20Britanniae">De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae</a>" or "On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain" during the middle of the sixth century. This essay is a polemic against corruption and Gildas provides little in the way of names and dates. He appears, however, to state that peace had lasted from the year of his birth to the time he was writing. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" is the other main source that bears on this period, in particular in an entry for the year 827 that records a list of the kings who bore the title ""<a href="bretwalda">bretwalda</a>"", or "Britain-ruler". That list shows a gap in the early sixth century that matches Gildas's version of events.

Ceawlin's reign belongs to the period of Anglo-Saxon expansion at the end of the sixth century. Though there are many unanswered questions about the chronology and activities of the early West Saxon rulers, it is clear that Ceawlin was one of the key figures in the final Anglo-Saxon conquest of southern Britain.

The two main written sources for early West Saxon history are the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. The "Chronicle" is a set of annals which were compiled near the year 890, during the reign of King <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>. They record earlier material for the older entries, which were assembled from earlier annals that no longer survive, as well as from saga material that might have been transmitted orally. The "Chronicle" dates the arrival of the future "West Saxons" in Britain to 495, when <a href="Cerdic">Cerdic</a> and his son, <a href="Cynric">Cynric</a>, land at "Cerdices ora", or Cerdic's shore. Almost twenty annals describing Cerdic's campaigns and those of his descendants appear interspersed through the next hundred years of entries in the "Chronicle". Although these annals provide most of what is known about Ceawlin, the historicity of many of the entries is uncertain.

The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List is a list of rulers of Wessex, including the lengths of their reigns. It survives in several forms, including as a preface to the [B] manuscript of the "Chronicle". As with the "Chronicle", the list was compiled during the reign of Alfred the Great, and both the list and the "Chronicle" are influenced by the desire of their writers to use a single line of descent to trace the lineage of the Kings of Wessex through Cerdic to <a href="Gewis">Gewis</a>, the legendary eponymous ancestor of the West Saxons, who is made to descend from <a href="Woden">Woden</a>. The result served the political purposes of the scribe, but is riddled with contradictions for historians.

The contradictions may be seen clearly by calculating dates by different methods from the various sources. The first event in West Saxon history, the date of which can be regarded as reasonably certain, is the baptism of <a href="Cynegils">Cynegils</a>, which occurred in the late 630s, perhaps as late as 640. The "Chronicle" dates Cerdic's arrival to 495, but adding up the lengths of the reigns as given in the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List leads to the conclusion that Cerdic's reign might have started in 532, a difference of 37 years. Neither 495 nor 532 may be treated as reliable, however--the latter date relies on the presumption that the Regnal List is correct in presenting the Kings of Wessex as having succeeded one another, with no omitted kings, and no <a href="Joint%20monarchs">joint kingship</a>s, and that the durations of the reigns are correct as given. None of these presumptions may be made safely.

The sources also are inconsistent on the length of Ceawlin's reign. The "Chronicle" gives it as thirty-two years, from 560 to 592, but the Regnal Lists disagree: different versions give it as seven or seventeen years. A recent detailed study of the Regnal List dates the arrival of the West Saxons in England to 538, and favours seven years as the most likely length of Ceawlin's reign, with dates of 581–588 proposed. The sources do agree that Ceawlin is the son of Cynric and he usually is named as the father of Cuthwine. There is one discrepancy in this case: the entry for 685 in the [A] version of the "Chronicle" assigns Ceawlin a son, Cutha, but in the 855 entry in the same manuscript, Cutha is listed as the son of Cuthwine. Cutha also is named as Ceawlin's brother in the [E] and [F] versions of the "Chronicle", in the 571 and 568 entries, respectively.

Whether Ceawlin is a descendant of Cerdic is a matter of debate. Subgroupings of different West Saxon lineages give the impression of separate groups, of which Ceawlin's line is one. Some of the problems in the Wessex genealogies may have come about because of efforts to integrate Ceawlin's line with the other lineages: it was very important to the West Saxons to be able to trace their ancestors back to Cerdic. Another reason for doubting the literal nature of these early genealogies is that the etymology of the names of several early members of the dynasty do not appear to be Germanic, as would be expected in the names of leaders of an apparently Anglo-Saxon dynasty. The name Ceawlin is one of the names that do not have convincing Anglo-Saxon etymologies; it seems more likely to be of native British origin.

The earliest sources do not use the term "West Saxon". According to <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", the term is interchangeable with the <a href="Gewisse">Gewisse</a>. The term "West Saxon" appears only in the late seventh century, after the reign of <a href="C%C3%A6dwalla%20of%20Wessex">Cædwalla</a>.

Ultimately, the kingdom of Wessex occupied the southwest of England, but the initial stages in this expansion are not apparent from the sources. Cerdic's landing, whenever it is to be dated, seems to have been near the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, and the annals record the conquest of the island in 530. In 534, according to the "Chronicle", Cerdic died and his son Cynric took the throne; the "Chronicle" adds that "they gave the Isle of Wight to their nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar". These records are in direct conflict with <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, who states that the Isle of Wight was settled by Jutes, not Saxons; the <a href="archaeological%20record">archaeological record</a> is somewhat in favour of Bede on this.

Subsequent entries in the "Chronicle" give details of some of the battles by which the West Saxons won their kingdom. Ceawlin's campaigns are not given as near the coast. They range along the <a href="Thames%20Valley">Thames valley</a> and beyond, as far as <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> in the east and the mouth of the <a href="Severn">Severn</a> in the west. Ceawlin clearly is part of the West Saxon expansion, but the military history of the period is difficult to understand. In what follows the dates are as given in the "Chronicle", although, as noted above, these are earlier than now thought accurate.

The first record of a battle fought by Ceawlin is in 556, when he and his father, Cynric, fought the native Britons at "Beran byrg", or Bera's Stronghold. This now is identified as <a href="Barbury%20Castle">Barbury Castle</a>, an Iron Age hill fort in Wiltshire, near Swindon. Cynric would have been king of Wessex at this time.

The first battle Ceawlin fought as king is dated by the "Chronicle" to 568, when he and Cutha fought with <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a>, the king of Kent. The entry says "Here Ceawlin and Cutha fought against Aethelberht and drove him into Kent; and they killed two <a href="Ealdorman">ealdormen</a>, Oslaf and Cnebba, on Wibbandun." The location of "Wibbandun", which can be translated as "Wibba's Mount", has not been identified definitely; it was at one time thought to be Wimbledon, but this now is known to be incorrect. This battle is notable as the first recorded conflict between the invading peoples: previous battles recorded in the "Chronicle" are between the Anglo-Saxons and the native Britons.

There are multiple examples of joint kingship in Anglo-Saxon history, and this may be another: it is not clear what Cutha's relationship to Ceawlin is, but it certainly is possible he was also a king. The annal for 577, below, is another possible example.

The annal for 571 reads: "Here Cuthwulf fought against the Britons at Bedcanford, and took four settlements: <a href="Limbury">Limbury</a> and <a href="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a>, <a href="Benson%2C%20Oxfordshire">Benson</a> and <a href="Eynsham">Eynsham</a>; and in the same year he passed away." Cuthwulf's relationship with Ceawlin is unknown, but the alliteration common to Anglo-Saxon royal families suggests Cuthwulf may be part of the West Saxon royal line. The location of the battle itself is unidentified. It has been suggested that it was <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>, but what is known of the early history of Bedford's names does not support this. This battle is of interest because it is surprising that an area so far east should still be in Briton hands this late: there is ample archaeological evidence of early Saxon and Anglian presence in the Midlands, and historians generally have interpreted Gildas's "De Excidio" as implying that the Britons had lost control of this area by the mid-sixth century. One possible explanation is that this annal records a reconquest of land that was lost to the Britons in the campaigns ending in the battle of Mons Badonicus.

The annal for 577 reads "Here Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought against the Britons, and they killed three kings, Coinmail and Condidan and Farinmail, in the place which is called <a href="Dyrham">Dyrham</a>, and took three cities: <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> and <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>." This entry is all that is known of these Briton kings; their names are in an archaic form that makes it very likely that this annal derives from a much older written source. The battle itself has long been regarded as a key moment in the Saxon advance, since in reaching the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a>, the West Saxons divided the Britons west of the Severn from land communication with those in the peninsula to the south of the Channel. Wessex almost certainly lost this territory to <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a> in 628, when the "Chronicle" records that "Cynegils and Cwichelm fought against Penda at Cirencester and then came to an agreement."

It is possible that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. <a href="Nennius">Nennius</a>, a ninth-century historian, mentions a "Hot Lake" in the land of the <a href="Hwicce">Hwicce</a>, which was along the Severn, and adds "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the "Ecclesiastical History" in terms very similar to those of Nennius.

<a href="Wansdyke%20%28earthwork%29">Wansdyke</a>, an early medieval defensive linear earthwork, runs from south of <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> to near <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough, Wiltshire</a>, passing not far from Bath. It probably was built in the fifth or sixth centuries, perhaps by Ceawlin.

Ceawlin's last recorded victory is in 584. The entry reads "Here Ceawlin and Cutha fought against the Britons at the place which is named Fethan leag, and Cutha was killed; and Ceawlin took many towns and countless war-loot, and in anger he turned back to his own [territory]." There is a wood named "Fethelée" mentioned in a twelfth-century document that relates to <a href="Stoke%20Lyne">Stoke Lyne</a>, in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, and it now is thought that the battle of Fethan leag must have been fought in this area.

The phrase "in anger he turned back to his own" probably indicates that this annal is drawn from saga material, as perhaps are all of the early Wessex annals. It also has been used to argue that perhaps, Ceawlin did not win the battle and that the chronicler chose not to record the outcome fully – a king does not usually come home "in anger" after taking "many towns and countless war-loot". It may be that Ceawlin's overlordship of the southern Britons came to an end with this battle.

About 731, Bede, a <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n monk and chronicler, wrote a work called the "Ecclesiastical History of the English People". The work was not primarily a secular history, but Bede provides much information about the history of the Anglo-Saxons, including a list early in the history of seven kings who, he said, held "imperium" over the other kingdoms south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. The usual translation for "imperium" is "overlordship". Bede names Ceawlin as the second on the list, although he spells it "Caelin", and adds that he was "known in the speech of his own people as Ceaulin". Bede also makes it clear that Ceawlin was not a Christian—Bede mentions a later king, Æthelberht of Kent, as "the first to enter the kingdom of heaven".

The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle," in an entry for the year 827, repeats Bede's list, adds <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert of Wessex</a>, and also mentions that they were known as "bretwalda", or "Britain-ruler". A great deal of scholarly attention has been given to the meaning of this word. It has been described as a term "of encomiastic poetry", but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.

Bede says that these kings had authority "south of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>", but the span of control, at least of the earlier bretwaldas, likely was less than this. In Ceawlin's case the range of control is hard to determine accurately, but Bede's inclusion of Ceawlin in the list of kings who held "imperium", and the list of battles he is recorded as having won, indicate an energetic and successful leader who, from a base in the upper Thames valley, dominated much of the surrounding area and held overlordship over the southern Britons for some period. Despite Ceawlin's military successes, the northern conquests he made could not always be retained: <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> took much of the upper Thames valley, and the north-eastern towns won in 571 were among territory subsequently under the control of Kent and Mercia at different times.

Bede's concept of the power of these overlords also must be regarded as the product of his eighth-century viewpoint. When the "Ecclesiastical History" was written, <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Mercia">Æthelbald of Mercia</a> dominated the English south of the Humber, and Bede's view of the earlier kings was doubtless strongly coloured by the state of England at that time. For the earlier "bretwaldas", such as Ælle and Ceawlin, there must be some element of anachronism in Bede's description. It also is possible that Bede only meant to refer to power over Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, not the native Britons.

Ceawlin is the second king in Bede's list. All the subsequent bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively, but there is a long gap, perhaps fifty years, between <a href="%C3%86lle%20of%20Sussex">Ælle of Sussex</a>, the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin. The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the "Chronicle" with reasonable accuracy. According to this analysis, the next bretwalda, <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a>, must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a> wrote to him in 601, since Gregory would have not written to an underking. Ceawlin defeated Æthelberht in 568 according to the "Chronicle". Æthelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580. The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years. If this battle is placed near the year 590, before Æthelberht had established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date. In any case, the battle with Æthelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590. The gap between Ælle and Ceawlin, on the other hand, has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in "De Excidio" of a peace lasting a generation or more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus.

Æthelberht of Kent succeeds Ceawlin on the list of bretwaldas, but the reigns may overlap somewhat: recent evaluations give Ceawlin a likely reign of 581–588, and place Æthelberht's accession near to the year 589, but these analyses are no more than scholarly guesses. Ceawlin's eclipse in 592, probably by Ceol, may have been the occasion for Æthelberht to rise to prominence; Æthelberht very likely was the dominant Anglo-Saxon king by 597. Æthelberht's rise may have been earlier: the 584 annal, even if it records a victory, is the last victory of Ceawlin's in the "Chronicle", and the period after that may have been one of Æthelberht's ascent and Ceawlin's decline.

Ceawlin lost the throne of Wessex in 592. The annal for that year reads, in part: "Here there was great slaughter at Woden's Barrow, and Ceawlin was driven out." Woden's Barrow is a tumulus, now called <a href="Adam%27s%20Grave">Adam's Grave</a>, at <a href="Alton%20Priors">Alton Priors</a>, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. No details of his opponent are given. The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, writing in about 1120, says that it was "the Angles and the British conspiring together". Alternatively, it may have been Ceol, who is supposed to have been the next king of Wessex, ruling for six years according to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Ceawlin died the following year. The relevant part of the annal reads: "Here Ceawlin and Cwichelm and Crida perished." Nothing more is known of Cwichelm and Crida, although they may have been members of the Wessex royal house – their names fit the alliterative pattern common to royal houses of the time.

According to the Regnal List, Ceol was a son of Cutha, who was a son of Cynric; and Ceolwulf, his brother, reigned for seventeen years after him. It is possible that some fragmentation of control among the West Saxons occurred at Ceawlin's death: Ceol and Ceolwulf may have been based in Wiltshire, as opposed to the upper Thames valley. This split also may have contributed to Æthelberht's ability to rise to dominance in southern England. The West Saxons remained influential in military terms, however: the "Chronicle" and Bede record continued military activity against Essex and Sussex within twenty or thirty years of Ceawlin's death.

Chagas disease

Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a <a href="tropical%20disease">tropical</a> <a href="parasitic%20disease">parasitic disease</a> caused by the <a href="protist">protist</a> "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>". It is spread mostly by insects known as <a href="Triatominae">Triatominae</a>, or "kissing bugs". The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30–40% of people develop further symptoms 10–30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the <a href="ventricles%20of%20the%20heart">ventricles of the heart</a> in 20–30%, leading to <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. An <a href="megaesophagus">enlarged esophagus</a> or an <a href="megacolon">enlarged colon</a> may also occur in 10% of people.
"T. cruzi" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the <a href="hematophagy">blood-sucking</a> "kissing bugs" of the subfamily <a href="Triatominae">Triatominae</a>. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: "vinchuca" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, "barbeiro" (the <a href="barber%20surgeon">barber</a>) in Brazil, "pito" in Colombia, "chinche" in Central America, and "chipo" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a>, <a href="organ%20transplantation">organ transplantation</a>, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by <a href="vertical%20transmission">vertical transmission</a> (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a> for "T. cruzi" in the blood.
Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. This may involve the use of <a href="insecticides">insecticides</a> or <a href="bed-nets">bed-nets</a>. Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication <a href="benznidazole">benznidazole</a> or <a href="nifurtimox">nifurtimox</a>. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.
It is estimated that 6.6 million people, mostly in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen an increase in the years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian physician <a href="Carlos%20Chagas">Carlos Chagas</a>, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a <a href="neglected%20tropical%20disease">neglected tropical disease</a>. It affects more than 150 other animals.

The human disease occurs in two stages: an <a href="acute%20%28medicine%29">acute</a> stage, which occurs shortly after an initial <a href="infection">infection</a>, and a <a href="chronic%20%28medicine%29">chronic</a> stage that develops over many years.

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a <a href="chagoma">chagoma</a>) where the parasite entered the body.

The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, people may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (<a href="myocarditis">myocarditis</a>) or brain (<a href="meningoencephalitis">meningoencephalitis</a>). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.

If symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called "indeterminate" chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called "determinate" chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.

The symptomatic (determinate) chronic stage affects the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> and <a href="Human%20heart">heart</a>. About two-thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including <a href="dilated%20cardiomyopathy">dilated cardiomyopathy</a>, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> damage, resulting in dilation of the <a href="digestive%20tract">digestive tract</a> (<a href="megacolon">megacolon</a> and <a href="megaesophagus">megaesophagus</a>), accompanied by severe <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a>. <a href="Swallowing">Swallowing</a> difficulties (secondary <a href="achalasia">achalasia</a>) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>.

20–50% of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement. Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop <a href="neuritis">neuritis</a> that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including <a href="dementia">dementia</a>, confusion, chronic <a href="encephalopathy">encephalopathy</a> and <a href="Stimulus%20%28physiology%29">sensory</a> and <a href="Motor%20skill">motor</a> deficits.

The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an <a href="inflammatory%20response">inflammatory response</a>, cellular <a href="lesions">lesions</a>, and <a href="fibrosis">fibrosis</a>. For example, intracellular <a href="amastigote">amastigote</a>s destroy the intramural neurons of the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a> in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart <a href="aneurysm">aneurysm</a>s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.

In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a> called a <a href="Triatominae">triatomine</a> bug. A triatomine becomes infected with "T. cruzi" by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.

The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as "kissing bugs". After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass "T. cruzi" parasites (called <a href="trypomastigote">trypomastigote</a>s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound.

Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact <a href="mucous%20membranes">mucous membranes</a>, such as the <a href="conjunctiva">conjunctiva</a>. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular <a href="amastigote">amastigote</a>s. The amastigotes multiply by <a href="binary%20fission">binary fission</a> and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector. (See also: )

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the <a href="sylvatic">sylvatic</a> <a href="Habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitat</a> and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly <a href="deforestation">deforested</a> areas, <a href="piassava%20palm">piassava palm</a> culture areas, and some parts of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a> region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.

"T. cruzi" can also be transmitted through <a href="blood%20transfusions">blood transfusions</a>. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a>), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4 °C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether "T. cruzi" can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.

Other modes of transmission include <a href="organ%20transplant">organ transplant</a>ation, through <a href="breast%20milk">breast milk</a>, and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also be spread congenitally (from a pregnant woman to her baby) through the <a href="placenta">placenta</a>, and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.

Oral transmission is an unusual route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers in the state of <a href="Para%C3%ADba">Paraíba</a>, Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated <a href="a%C3%A7a%C3%AD%20palm">açaí palm</a> fruit juice and <a href="sugarcane%20juice">garapa</a>. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated <a href="guava">guava</a> juice.

Chagas disease is a growing problem in Europe, because the majority of cases with chronic infection are asymptomatic and because of migration from Latin America.

The presence of "T. cruzi" is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by <a href="microscope">microscopic</a> examination of fresh anti<a href="coagulate">coagulate</a>d blood, or its <a href="buffy%20coat">buffy coat</a>, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with <a href="Giemsa%20stain">Giemsa</a>, for direct visualization of <a href="parasitism">parasites</a>. Microscopically, "T. cruzi" can be confused with "<a href="Trypanosoma%20rangeli">Trypanosoma rangeli</a>", which is not known to be <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic in humans. Isolation of "T. cruzi" can occur by inoculation into <a href="mouse">mice</a>, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by <a href="xenodiagnosis">xenodiagnosis</a>, where uninfected <a href="Reduviidae">Reduviidae</a> bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.

Various <a href="immunoassay">immunoassay</a>s for "T. cruzi" are available and can be used to distinguish among <a href="Strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a> (zymodemes of "T.cruzi" with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting <a href="complement%20fixation">complement fixation</a>, indirect <a href="hemagglutination">hemagglutination</a>, indirect <a href="fluorescence">fluorescence</a> assays, <a href="radioimmunoassay">radioimmunoassay</a>s, and <a href="ELISA">ELISA</a>. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR).
There is currently no vaccine against Chagas disease. Prevention is generally focused on decreasing the numbers of the <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">insect that spreads it</a> ("<a href="Triatoma">Triatoma</a>") and decreasing their contact with humans. This is done by using sprays and paints containing <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s (synthetic <a href="pyrethroid">pyrethroid</a>s), and improving housing and sanitary conditions in rural areas. For urban dwellers, spending vacations and <a href="camping">camping</a> out in the wilderness or sleeping at hostels or mud houses in endemic areas can be dangerous; a <a href="mosquito%20net">mosquito net</a> is recommended. Some measures of vector control include:

A number of potential vaccines are currently being tested. Vaccination with "<a href="Trypanosoma%20rangeli">Trypanosoma rangeli</a>" has produced positive results in animal models. More recently, the potential of DNA vaccines for <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a> of acute and chronic Chagas disease is being tested by several research groups.

<a href="Blood%20transfusion">Blood transfusion</a> was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease, but the development and implementation of <a href="blood%20bank">blood bank</a> screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. <a href="Blood%20donation">Blood donation</a>s in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.

The US FDA has approved two Chagas tests, including one approved in April 2010, and has published guidelines that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products. While these tests are not required in US, an estimated 75–90% of the blood supply is currently tested for Chagas, including all units collected by the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a>, which accounts for 40% of the U.S. blood supply. The Chagas Biovigilance Network reports current incidents of Chagas-positive blood products in the United States, as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the FDA in 2007.

There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease: <a href="antiparasitic">antiparasitic</a> treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the <a href="parasympathetic%20nervous%20system">parasympathetic nervous system</a>. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.

Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include <a href="azole">azole</a> or <a href="Nitro%20compound">nitro</a> derivatives, such as <a href="benznidazole">benznidazole</a> or <a href="nifurtimox">nifurtimox</a>. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate "T. cruzi" from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.

Studies suggest antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in more than 90% of infants but only about 60–85% of adults treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease. Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.

Treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether <a href="prophylactic">prophylactic</a> treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).

In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, <a href="pacemaker">pacemaker</a>s and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug <a href="amiodarone">amiodarone</a>, may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for <a href="heart%20transplantation">heart transplantation</a> surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a <a href="contraindication">contraindication</a> for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a> that follows surgery.

Chagas disease affects 8 to 10 million people living in endemic Latin American countries, with an additional 300,000–400,000 living in nonendemic countries, including Spain and the United States. An estimated 41,200 new cases occur annually in endemic countries, and 14,400 infants are born with congenital Chagas disease annually. in 2010 it resulted in approximately 10,300 deaths up from 9,300 in 1990.

The disease is present in 18 countries on the American continents, ranging from the southern United States to northern <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the <a href="Southern%20Cone">Southern Cone</a> region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the more than 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the <a href="natural%20reservoir">natural reservoir</a>s of "T. cruzi".

Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds appear to be immune to infection and therefore are not considered to be a "T. cruzi" reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, <a href="sylvatic">sylvatic</a> (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.

The primary wildlife reservoirs for "Trypanosoma cruzi" in the United States include <a href="opossum">opossum</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, <a href="woodrat">woodrat</a>s, and <a href="mice">mice</a>. Opossums are particularly important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.

Studies on raccoons in the Southeast have yielded infection rates ranging from 47% to as low as 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana, and range from a low of 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent "T. cruzi" prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.

Chronic Chagas disease remains a major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the <a href="Southern%20Cone">Southern Cone</a> Initiative, and at least three countries (<a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, in 1997, and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission. In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces, and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.

Screening of donated blood, blood components, and solid organ donors, as well as donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue products for "T. cruzi" is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, and there have been 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.

The disease was named after the <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian physician and <a href="Epidemiology">epidemiologist</a> <a href="Carlos%20Chagas">Carlos Chagas</a>, who first described it in 1909. The disease was not seen as a major <a href="public%20health">public health</a> problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored). Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now <a href="Reduviidae">Reduviidae</a>: <a href="Triatominae">Triatominae</a>) harbored a <a href="flagellate">flagellate</a> protozoan, a new species of the genus "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>", and was able to demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to <a href="marmoset">marmoset</a> monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed <a href="squirrel%20monkey">squirrel monkey</a>s were also vulnerable to infection.

Chagas named the pathogenic parasite as "Trypanosoma cruzi" and later that year as "Schizotrypanum cruzi", both honoring <a href="Oswaldo%20Cruz">Oswaldo Cruz</a>, the noted Brazilian physician and <a href="epidemiologist">epidemiologist</a> who successfully fought epidemics of <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> and other cities in the beginning of the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus "<a href="Pneumocystis%20pneumonia">Pneumocystis</a>", later infamously linked to PCP ("Pneumocystis" <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus "Schizotrypanum", but following the description of "Pneumocystis" by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name "Trypanosoma cruzi".

In <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the disease is known as "mal de Chagas-Mazza", in honor of <a href="Salvador%20Mazza">Salvador Mazza</a>, the <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> physician who in 1926 began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>" in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.

It has been hypothesized that <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called great black bug of the <a href="Pampas">Pampas</a> ("vinchuca") (see <a href="Charles%20Darwin%27s%20illness">Charles Darwin's illness</a>). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of <a href="the%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">the Voyage of the Beagle</a> as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> near <a href="Mendoza%20Province">Mendoza</a>. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near <a href="Valparaiso">Valparaiso</a>, but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> by using modern <a href="PCR">PCR</a> techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's <a href="curator">curator</a>.

Several experimental treatments have shown promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of <a href="2%2C3-oxidosqualene">oxidosqualene</a> <a href="cyclase">cyclase</a> and <a href="squalene%20synthase">squalene synthase</a>, <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a> inhibitors, <a href="dermaseptin">dermaseptin</a>s collected from frogs in the genus "<a href="Phyllomedusa">Phyllomedusa</a>" ("<a href="Phyllomedusa%20oreades">P. oreades</a>" and "<a href="Phyllomedusa%20distincta">P. distincta</a>"), the <a href="sesquiterpene%20lactone">sesquiterpene lactone</a> dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects the growth of cultured <a href="epimastigote">epimastigote</a>-phase "Trypanosoma cruzi", inhibitors of <a href="purine">purine</a> uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in <a href="trypanothione">trypanothione</a> metabolism. Hopefully, new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the "T. cruzi" <a href="genome">genome</a>.

Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion.

<a href="Megazol">Megazol</a> in a study seems more active against Chagas than benznidazole but has not been studied in humans. A Chagas vaccine (TcVac3) has been found to be effective in mice with plans for studies in <a href="dog">dog</a>s. It is hoped that it will be commercially available by 2018.

Cannon

A cannon (plural: "cannon" or "cannons") is a type of <a href="gun">gun</a> classified as <a href="artillery">artillery</a> that launches a projectile using propellant. In the past, <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> was the primary propellant before the invention of <a href="smokeless%20powder">smokeless powder</a> in the 19th century. Cannon vary in <a href="caliber">caliber</a>, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the <a href="battlespace">battlefield</a>. The word "cannon" is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as "tube", "cane", or "reed". In the modern era, the term "cannon" has fallen into decline, replaced by "guns" or "artillery" if not a more specific term such as "<a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a>" or "<a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>", except for high calibre automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>s.

The earliest known depiction of cannon appeared in <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty%23Gunpowder%20warfare">Song dynasty China</a> as early as the 12th century, however solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannon do not appear until the 13th century. In 1288 <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> troops are recorded to have used <a href="hand%20cannon">hand cannon</a>s in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period. By 1326 depictions of cannon had also appeared in Europe and almost immediately recorded usage of cannon began appearing. By the end of the 14th century cannon were widespread throughout <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. Cannon were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374 when cannon were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe. Cannon featured prominently as siege weapons and ever larger pieces appeared. In 1464 a 16,000 kg (35273.962 lbs) cannon known as the <a href="Great%20Turkish%20Bombard">Great Turkish Bombard</a> was created in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Cannon as field artillery became more important after 1453 with the introduction of <a href="Limbers%20and%20caissons">limber</a>, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility. European cannon reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient "classic form" around 1480. This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.

"Cannon" is derived from the <a href="Italian%20language%23Origins">Old Italian</a> word "cannone", meaning "large tube", which came from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "canna", in turn originating from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> κάννα ("kanna"), "reed", and then generalised to mean any hollow tube-like object; cognate with <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> "qanu(m)" and <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "qāneh", "tube, reed". The word has been used to refer to a <a href="Gun%23Terminology">gun</a> since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England. Both "Cannons" and "Cannon" are correct and in common usage, with one or the other having preference in different parts of the English-speaking world. "Cannons" is more common in North America and Australia, while "cannon" as plural is more common in the United Kingdom.

The cannon may have appeared as early as the 12th century in China, and was probably a parallel development or evolution of the <a href="fire-lance">fire-lance</a>, a short ranged anti-personnel weapon combining a gunpowder-filled tube and a polearm of some sort. Co-viative projectiles such as iron scraps or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced by metal.

The earliest known depiction of a cannon is a sculpture from the <a href="Dazu%20Rock%20Carvings">Dazu Rock Carvings</a> in <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the <a href="Wuwei%20Bronze%20Cannon">Wuwei Bronze Cannon</a> dated to 1227, the <a href="Heilongjiang%20hand%20cannon">Heilongjiang hand cannon</a> dated to 1288, and the <a href="Xanadu%20Gun">Xanadu Gun</a> dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7 cm in length and weighs 6.2 kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.

The Heilongjiang hand cannon is also often considered by some to be the oldest firearm since it was unearthed near the area where the <a href="History%20of%20Yuan">History of Yuan</a> reports a battle took place involving hand cannon. According to the History of Yuan, in 1288, a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannon into battle against the rebel prince Nayan.

Chen Bingying argues there were no guns before 1259 while Dang Shoushan believes the Wuwei gun and other <a href="Western%20Xia">Western Xia</a> era samples point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200. Sinologist <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a> and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the "true" cannon. Whether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century.

References to cannon proliferated throughout China in the following centuries. Cannon featured in literary pieces. In 1341 Xian Zhang wrote a poem called "The Iron Cannon Affair" describing a cannonball fired from an eruptor which could "pierce the heart or belly when striking a man or horse, and even transfix several persons at once."

By the 1350s the cannon was used extensively in Chinese warfare. In 1358 the Ming army failed to take a city due to its garrisons' usage of cannon, however they themselves would use cannon, in the thousands, later on during the siege of <a href="Suzhou">Suzhou</a> in 1366. The Korean kingdom of <a href="Joseon">Joseon</a> started producing gunpowder in 1374 and cannon by 1377. Cannon appeared in <a href="%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i%20Vi%E1%BB%87t">Đại Việt</a> by 1390 at the latest.

During the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> cannon were used in riverine warfare at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Poyang">Battle of Lake Poyang</a>. One shipwreck in Shandong had a cannon dated to 1377 and an anchor dated to 1372. From the 13th to 15th centuries cannon-armed Chinese ships also travelled throughout Southeast Asia.

The first of the western cannon to be introduced were <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breach-loaders</a> in the early 16th century which the Chinese began producing themselves by 1523 and began improving later on.

Japan did not acquire a cannon until 1510 when a monk brought one back from China, and did not produce any in appreciable numbers. During the 1593 <a href="Siege%20of%20Pyongyang%20%281593%29">Siege of Pyongyang</a>, 40,000 Ming troops deployed a variety of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage and the use of arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the <a href="Japanese%20invasions%20of%20Korea%20%281592%E2%80%9398%29">Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)</a>, the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the <a href="turtle%20ship">turtle ship</a>s of <a href="Yi%20Sun-sin">Yi Sun-sin</a>.

According to <a href="Ivan%20Petlin">Ivan Petlin</a>, the first <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n envoy to <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>, in September 1619, the city was armed with large cannon with cannonballs weighing more than 30 kg. His general observation was that the Chinese were militarily capable and had firearms:

Outside of China, the earliest texts to mention gunpowder are <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>'s "<a href="Opus%20Majus">Opus Majus</a>" (1267) and "Opus Tertium" in what has been interpreted as references to <a href="firecracker">firecracker</a>s. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that <a href="Roger%20Bacon%23Other%20attributed%20works">another work tentatively attributed to Bacon</a>, "Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae", also known as "Opus Minor", dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder hidden in the text. These claims have been disputed by science historians. In any case, the formula itself is not useful for firearms or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.

There is a record of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being discovered in the nineteenth century but the artifact has since been lost. The earliest known European depiction of a gun appeared in 1326 in a manuscript by <a href="Walter%20de%20Milemete">Walter de Milemete</a>, although not necessarily drawn by him, known as "De Nobilitatibus, sapientii et prudentiis regum" (Concerning the Majesty, Wisdom, and Prudence of Kings), which displays a gun with a large arrow emerging from it and its user lowering a long stick to ignite the gun through the touchole In the same year, another similar illustration showed a darker gun being set off by a group of knights, which also featured in another work of de Milemete's, "De secretis secretorum Aristotelis". On 11 February of that same year, the <a href="Signoria">Signoria</a> of <a href="Florence">Florence</a> appointed two officers to obtain "canones de mettallo" and ammunition for the town's defense. In the following year a document from the Turin area recorded a certain amount was paid "for the making of a certain instrument or device made by Friar Marcello for the projection of pellets of lead." A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Cividale del Friuli</a>, using gunpowder weapons of some sort. The 1320s seem to have been the takeoff point for guns in Europe according to most modern military historians. Scholars suggest that the lack of gunpowder weapons in a well-traveled Venetian's catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in Europe up until this point, further solidifying the 1320 mark, however more evidence in this area may be forthcoming in the future.

The oldest extant cannon in Europe is a small bronze example unearthed in Loshult, <a href="Scania">Scania</a> in southern <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. It dates from the early-mid 14th century, and is currently in the <a href="Swedish%20History%20Museum">Swedish History Museum</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.

Early cannon in Europe often shot arrows and were known by an assortment of names such as "<a href="pot-de-fer">pot-de-fer</a>", "tonnoire", "ribaldis", and "büszenpyle". The "ribaldi"s, which shot large arrows and simplistic <a href="grapeshot">grapeshot</a>, were first mentioned in the <a href="Wardrobe%20%28government%29">English Privy Wardrobe</a> accounts during preparations for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>, between 1345 and 1346. The Florentine <a href="Giovanni%20Villani">Giovanni Villani</a> recounts their destructiveness, indicating that by the end of the battle, "the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls." Similar cannon were also used at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%E2%80%9347%29">Siege of Calais (1346–47)</a>, although it was not until the 1380s that the "ribaudekin" clearly became mounted on wheels.

The battle of Crecy which pitted the English against the French in 1346 featured the early use of cannon which helped the long-bowmen repulse a large force of Genoese crossbowmen deployed by the French. The English originally intended to use the cannon against cavalry sent to attack their archers, thinking that the loud noises produced by their cannon would panic the advancing horses along with killing the knights atop them.Early cannon could also be used for more than simply killing men and scaring horses. English cannon were used defensively during the siege of the castle Breteuil to launch fire onto an advancing belfry. In this way cannon could be used to burn down siege equipment before it reached the fortifications. The use of cannon to shoot fire could also be used offensively as another battle involved the setting of a castle ablaze with similar methods. The particular incendiary used in these cannon was most likely a gunpowder mixture. This is one area where early Chinese and European cannon share a similarity as both were used to shoot fire as a possible use.Another aspect of early European cannon is that they were rather small, dwarfed by the bombards which would come later. In fact, it is possible that the cannon used at Crecy were capable of being moved rather quickly as there is an anonymous chronicle that notes the guns being used to attack the French camp, indicating that they would have been mobile enough press the attack. These smaller cannon would eventually give way to larger, wall breaching guns by the end of the 1300s.

Solid documentary evidence of cannon appeared in the middle east around the 1360s, however some historians consider the arrival of the cannon there to be far earlier.

According to historian <a href="Ahmad%20Y.%20al-Hassan">Ahmad Y. al-Hassan</a>, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ain%20Jalut">Battle of Ain Jalut</a> in 1260, the <a href="Mamluk">Mamluk</a>s used cannon against the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>. He claims that this was "the first cannon in history" and used a gunpowder formula almost identical to the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder. He also argues that this was not known in China or Europe until much later. Hassan further claims that the earliest textual evidence of cannon is from the middle east, based on earlier originals which report hand-held cannon being used by the Mamluks at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. However Hassan's claims have been refuted by other historians such as David Ayalon, Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, Tonio Andrade, and Gabor Ágoston. Khan argues that it was the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and believes cannon only reached <a href="Mamluk%20Egypt">Mamluk Egypt</a> in the 1370s. According to Needham, the term "midfa", dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365 Similarly, Andrade dates the textual appearance of cannon in middle eastern sources to the 1360s. Gabor Ágoston and David Ayalon believe the Mamluks had certainly used siege cannon by the 1360s, but earlier uses of cannon in the <a href="Islamic%20World">Islamic World</a> are vague with a possible appearance in the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Emirate of Granada</a> by the 1320s and 1330s, however evidence is inconclusive.

<a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> reported the use of cannon as <a href="siege%20machine">siege machine</a>s by the <a href="Marinid">Marinid</a> sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf at the siege of <a href="Sijilmasa">Sijilmasa</a> in 1274. The passage by Ibn Khaldun on the Marinid Siege of Sijilmassa in 1274 occurs as follows: "[ The Sultan] installed siege engines … and gunpowder engines …, which project small balls of iron. These balls are ejected from a chamber … placed in front of a kindling fire of gunpowder; this happens by a strange property which attributes all actions to the power of the Creator." However the source is not contemporary and was written a century later around 1382. Its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by most historians, who urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204–1324 period as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, as they did for an earlier incendiary, naphtha. Ágoston and Peter Purton note that in the 1204–1324 period, late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, "naft", that they used for an earlier incendiary <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a>. Needham believes Ibn Khaldun was speaking of fire lances rather than hand cannon.

The Ottoman Empire in particular made good use of cannon as siege artillery. Sixty-eight super-sized bombards were used by <a href="Mehmed%20the%20Conqueror">Mehmed the Conqueror</a> to <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">capture Constantinople</a> in 1453. Jim Bradbury argues that Urban, a <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> cannon engineer, introduced this cannon from Central Europe to the Ottoman realm; according to Paul Hammer, however, it could have been introduced from other Islamic countries which had earlier used cannon. These cannon could fire heavy stone balls a mile, and the sound of their blast could reportedly be heard from a distance of . <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkodër</a>an historian <a href="Marin%20Barleti">Marin Barleti</a> discusses Turkish bombards at length in his book "<a href="The%20Siege%20of%20Shkodra%20%28book%29">De obsidione Scodrensi</a>" (1504), describing the 1478–79 <a href="siege%20of%20Shkodra">siege of Shkodra</a> in which eleven bombards and two mortars were employed. The Ottomans also used cannon to sink ships which attempted to prevent them from crossing the Bosporus strait. Ottoman cannon also proved effective at stopping crusaders at Varna in 1444 and Kosovo in 1448 despite the presence of European cannon in the former case.

The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) were created by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the <a href="Anglo-Turkish%20War%20%281807%E2%80%9309%29">Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09)</a>. These were cast in bronze into two parts, the chase (the barrel) and the breech, which combined weighed 18.4 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate moving it.

Fathullah Shirazi, a <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> inhabitant of India who worked for <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a> in the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, developed a <a href="volley%20gun">volley gun</a> in the 16th century.

While there is evidence of cannon in Iran as early as 1405 they were not widespread. This changed following the increased use of firearms by Shah Isma il I, and the Iranian army used 500 cannon by the 1620s, probably captured from the Ottomans or acquired by allies in Europe. By 1443 Iranians were also making some of their own cannon, as Mir Khawand wrote of a 1200kg metal piece being made by an Iranian "rekhtagar" which was most likely a cannon. Due to the difficulties of transporting cannon in mountainous terrain, their use was less common compared to their use in Europe.

Documentary evidence of cannon in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> does not appear until 1382 and they were used only in sieges, often by the defenders. It was not until 1475 when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow that they began to produce cannon natively.

Later on large cannon were known as bombards, ranging from three to five feet in length and were used by <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> and <a href="Kotor">Kotor</a> in defence during the later 14th century. The first bombards were made of iron, but bronze became more prevalent as it was recognized as more stable and capable of propelling stones weighing as much as . Around the same period, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> began to accumulate its own cannon to face the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, starting with medium-sized cannon long and of 10 in calibre. The earliest reliable recorded use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1396, forcing the Ottomans to withdraw. The Ottomans acquired their own cannon and laid siege to the Byzantine capital again in 1422. By 1453, the Ottomans used 68 Hungarian-made cannon for the 55-day bombardment of the <a href="walls%20of%20Constantinople">walls of Constantinople</a>, "hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby." The largest of their cannon was the Great Turkish Bombard, which required an operating crew of 200 men and 70 oxen, and 10,000 men to transport it. Gunpowder made the formerly devastating <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a> obsolete, and with the final fall of Constantinople—which was protected by what were once the strongest walls in Europe—on 29 May 1453, "it was the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">end of an era</a> in more ways than one."

While previous smaller guns could burn down structures with fire, larger cannon were so effective that engineers were forced to develop stronger castle walls to prevent their keeps from falling. This isn't to say that cannon were only used to batter down walls as fortifications began using cannon as defensive instruments such as an example in India where the fort of Raicher had gun ports built into its walls to accommodate the use of defensive cannon. In "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20War%20%28Machiavelli%29">Art of War</a>" Niccolò Machiavelli opined that field artillery forced an army to take up a defensive posture and this opposed a more ideal offensive stance. Machiavelli's concerns can be seen in the criticisms of Portuguese mortars being used in India during the sixteenth century as lack of mobility was one of the key problems with the design. In Russia the early cannon were again placed in forts as a defensive tool. Cannon were also difficult to move around in certain types of terrain with mountains providing a great obstacle for them, for these reasons offensives conducted with cannon would be difficult to pull off in places such as Iran.

By the 16th century, cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule was that the longer the barrel, the longer the range. Some cannon made during this time had barrels exceeding in length, and could weigh up to . Consequently, large amounts of gunpowder were needed, to allow them to fire stone balls several hundred yards. By mid-century, European monarchs began to classify cannon to reduce the confusion. <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II of France</a> opted for six sizes of cannon, but others settled for more; the Spanish used twelve sizes, and the English sixteen. Better powder had been developed by this time as well. Instead of the finely ground powder used by the first bombards, powder was replaced by a "corned" variety of coarse grains. This coarse powder had pockets of air between grains, allowing fire to travel through and ignite the entire charge quickly and uniformly.

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. As they were not effective at breaching the newer fortifications resulting from the development of cannon, <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s—such as <a href="siege%20tower">siege tower</a>s and <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a>s—became less widely used. However, wooden "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the gunpowder age—such as that used at <a href="Siege%20of%20Kazan">Siege of Kazan</a> in 1552, which could hold ten large-calibre cannon, in addition to 50 lighter pieces. Another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was the change in conventional fortifications. <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> wrote, "There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days." Although <a href="castle">castle</a>s were not immediately made obsolete by cannon, their use and importance on the battlefield rapidly declined. Instead of majestic <a href="tower">tower</a>s and <a href="merlon">merlon</a>s, the walls of new fortresses were thick, angled, and sloped, while towers became low and stout; increasing use was also made of earth and brick in <a href="Breastwork%20%28fortification%29">breastworks</a> and <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>s. These new defences became known as <a href="bastion%20fort">bastion fort</a>s, after their characteristic shape which attempted to force any advance towards it directly into the firing line of the guns. A few of these featured <a href="Artillery%20battery">cannon batteries</a>, such as the <a href="House%20of%20Tudor">House of Tudor</a>'s <a href="Device%20Forts">Device Forts</a>, in England. Bastion forts soon replaced castles in Europe, and, eventually, those in the Americas, as well.

By the end of the 15th century, several technological advancements made cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and <a href="trunnion">trunnion</a>s became common, and the invention of the <a href="Limbers%20and%20caissons">limber</a> further facilitated transportation. As a result, field artillery became more viable, and began to see more widespread use, often alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges. Better gunpowder, cast-iron projectiles (replacing stone), and the standardisation of calibres meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly. In "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20War%20%28Machiavelli%29">The Art of War</a>", Niccolò Machiavelli observed that "It is true that the <a href="arquebus">arquebus</a>es and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery." This was the case at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Flodden">Battle of Flodden</a>, in 1513: the English <a href="field%20gun">field gun</a>s outfired the Scottish siege artillery, firing two or three times as many rounds. Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still the slowest component of the army: a heavy <a href="English%20cannon">English cannon</a> required 23 horses to transport, while a culverin needed nine. Even with this many animals pulling, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organisation, and undeveloped tactics, the combination of <a href="pike%20and%20shot">pike and shot</a> still dominated the battlefields of Europe.

Innovations continued, notably the German invention of the mortar, a thick-walled, short-barrelled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could hit targets behind walls or other defences. This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learnt to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. Setting the bomb fuse was a problem. "Single firing" was first used to ignite the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the cannon's propellant. This often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up as it left the mortar. Because of this, "double firing" was tried where the gunner lit the fuse and then the touch hole. This, however, required considerable skill and timing, and was especially dangerous if the gun misfired, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was superfluous as the heat of firing would light the fuse.

<a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus%20of%20Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden</a> emphasised the use of light cannon and mobility in his army, and created new formations and tactics that revolutionised artillery. He discontinued using all 12 pounder—or heavier—cannon as field artillery, preferring, instead, to use cannon that could be handled by only a few men. One obsolete type of gun, the "leatheren" was replaced by 4 pounder and 9 pounder demi-culverins. These could be operated by three men, and pulled by only two horses. Adolphus's army was also the first to use a cartridge that contained both powder and shot which sped up reloading, increasing the rate of fire. Finally, against infantry he pioneered the use of <a href="canister%20shot">canister shot</a> – essentially a tin can filled with musket balls. Until then there was no more than one cannon for every thousand infantrymen on the battlefield but Gustavus Adolphus increased the number of cannon sixfold. Each regiment was assigned two pieces, though he often arranged then into batteries instead of distributing them piecemeal. He used these batteries to break his opponent's infantry line, while his cavalry would <a href="flanking%20maneuver">outflank</a> their heavy guns.

At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Breitenfeld%20%281631%29">Battle of Breitenfeld</a>, in 1631, Adolphus proved the effectiveness of the changes made to his army, by defeating <a href="Johann%20Tserclaes%2C%20Count%20of%20Tilly">Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly</a>. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's <a href="line%20%28formation%29">linear</a> formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.

In England cannon were being used to besiege various fortified buildings during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. <a href="Nathaniel%20Nye">Nathaniel Nye</a> is recorded as testing a <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> cannon in 1643 and experimenting with a <a href="Saker%20%28cannon%29">saker</a> in 1645. From 1645 he was the master gunner to the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> garrison at <a href="Evesham">Evesham</a> and in 1646 he successfully directed the artillery at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Worcester%20%281646%29">Siege of Worcester</a>, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book "The Art of Gunnery". Believing that war was as much a science as an art, his explanations focused on <a href="triangulation">triangulation</a>, <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, theoretical mathematics, and <a href="cartography">cartography</a> as well as practical considerations such as the ideal specification for gunpowder or <a href="slow%20match">slow match</a>es. His book acknowledged mathematicians such as <a href="Robert%20Recorde">Robert Recorde</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Jordanus">Marcus Jordanus</a> as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Fontana%20Tartaglia">Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia</a> and Thomas (or Francis) Malthus (author of "A Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works").
Around this time also came the idea of aiming the cannon to hit a target. Gunners controlled the range of their cannon by measuring the angle of elevation, using a "gunner's quadrant." Cannon did not have <a href="Sight%20%28device%29">sights</a>, therefore, even with measuring tools, aiming was still largely guesswork.

In the latter half of the 17th century, the French engineer <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Prestre%20de%20Vauban">Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban</a> introduced a more systematic and scientific approach to attacking gunpowder fortresses, in a time when many field commanders "were notorious dunces in siegecraft." Careful <a href="sapping">sapping</a> forward, supported by <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfilading</a> <a href="ricochet">ricochet</a>s, was a key feature of this system, and it even allowed Vauban to calculate the length of time a siege would take. He was also a prolific builder of bastion forts, and did much to popularize the idea of "depth in defence" in the face of cannon. These principles were followed into the mid-19th century, when changes in armaments necessitated greater depth defence than Vauban had provided for. It was only in the years prior to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> that new works began to break radically away from his designs.

The lower tier of 17th-century English <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> were usually equipped with demi-cannon, guns that fired a solid shot, and could weigh up to . Demi-cannon were capable of firing these heavy metal balls with such force that they could penetrate more than a metre of solid oak, from a distance of , and could dismast even the largest ships at close range. Full cannon fired a shot, but were discontinued by the 18th century, as they were too unwieldy. By the end of the 18th century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s cannon, as well as the acceptable defects, and their severity. The <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> tested guns by measuring them, firing them two or three times—termed "proof by powder"—and using <a href="hydrostatic%20test">pressurized water to detect leaks</a>.
The <a href="carronade">carronade</a> was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779; the lower muzzle velocity of the round shot when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden <a href="wikt%3Asplinter">splinters</a> when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, as they were believed to be more deadly than the ball by itself. The carronade was much shorter, and weighed between a third to a quarter of the equivalent <a href="long%20gun">long gun</a>; for example, a 32-pounder carronade weighed less than a <a href="ton">ton</a>, compared with a 32-pounder long gun, which weighed over 3 tons. The guns were, therefore, easier to handle, and also required less than half as much gunpowder, allowing fewer men to crew them. Carronades were manufactured in the usual <a href="naval%20artillery">naval gun</a> <a href="calibre">calibre</a>s, but were not counted in a ship of the line's rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can be misleading, as they often carried more cannon than were listed.

Cannon were crucial in <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s rise to power, and continued to play an important role in his army in later years. During the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, the unpopularity of the <a href="French%20Directory">Directory</a> led to riots and rebellions. When over 25,000 royalists led by General Danican assaulted Paris, <a href="Paul%20Barras">Paul Barras</a> was appointed to defend the capital; outnumbered five to one and disorganised, the Republicans were desperate. When Napoleon arrived, he reorganised the defences but realised that without cannon the city could not be held. He ordered <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a> to bring the guns from the Sablons artillery park; the Major and his cavalry fought their way to the recently captured cannon, and brought them back to Napoleon. When Danican's poorly trained men attacked, on <a href="13%20Vend%C3%A9miaire">13 Vendémiaire</a>, 1795 – 5 October 1795, in the <a href="Vend%C3%A9miaire">calendar used in France</a> at the time — Napoleon ordered his cannon to fire grapeshot into the mob, an act that became known as the "<a href="13%20Vend%C3%A9miaire%23A%20whiff%20of%20grapeshot%26quot%3B">whiff of grapeshot</a>". The slaughter effectively ended the threat to the new government, while, at the same time, made Bonaparte a famous—and popular—public figure. Among the first generals to recognise that artillery was not being used to its full potential, Napoleon often massed his cannon into batteries and introduced several changes into the French artillery, improving it significantly and making it among the finest in Europe. Such tactics were successfully used by the French, for example, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Friedland">Battle of Friedland</a>, when sixty-six guns fired a total of 3,000 <a href="roundshot">roundshot</a> and 500 rounds of grapeshot, inflicting severe casualties to the Russian forces, whose losses numbered over 20,000 killed and wounded, in total. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>—Napoleon's final battle—the French army had many more artillery pieces than either the <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> or <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>ns. As the battlefield was muddy, <a href="recoil">recoil</a> caused cannon to bury themselves into the ground after firing, resulting in slow rates of fire, as more effort was required to move them back into an adequate firing position; also, roundshot did not <a href="ricochet">ricochet</a> with as much force from the wet earth. Despite the drawbacks, sustained artillery fire proved deadly during the engagement, especially during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo%23The%20French%20cavalry%20attack">French cavalry attack</a>. The British infantry, having formed <a href="infantry%20square">infantry square</a>s, took heavy losses from the French guns, while their own cannon fired at the <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a>s and <a href="lancer">lancer</a>s, when they fell back to regroup. Eventually, the French ceased their assault, after taking heavy losses from the British cannon and musket fire.

In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by <a href="William%20Armstrong%2C%201st%20Baron%20Armstrong">William Armstrong</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Whitworth">Joseph Whitworth</a>. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.

Western cannon during the 19th century became larger, more destructive, more accurate, and could fire at longer range. One example is the American wrought-iron, muzzle-loading rifle, or <a href="Griffen%20gun">Griffen gun</a> (usually called the 3-inch Ordnance Rifle), used during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, which had an effective range of over . Another is the smoothbore <a href="Canon%20obusier%20de%2012">12-pounder Napoleon</a>, which originated in France in 1853 and was widely used by both sides in the American Civil War. This cannon was renowned for its sturdiness, reliability, firepower, flexibility, relatively lightweight, and range of .
The practice of <a href="rifling">rifling</a>—casting spiralling lines inside the cannon's barrel—was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon projectiles <a href="Gyroscope">gyroscopic</a> stability, which improved their accuracy. One of the earliest rifled cannon was the <a href="breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading</a> <a href="Armstrong%20Gun">Armstrong Gun</a>—also invented by William Armstrong—which boasted significantly improved range, accuracy, and power than earlier weapons. The projectile fired from the Armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship's side, and explode inside the enemy vessel, causing increased damage, and casualties. The British military adopted the Armstrong gun, and was impressed; <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">the Duke of Cambridge</a> even declared that it "could do everything but speak." Despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors, the Armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration, in favour of the muzzle-loading pieces that had been in use before. While both types of gun were effective against wooden ships, neither had the capability to pierce the armour of <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclads</a>; due to reports of slight problems with the breeches of the Armstrong gun, and their higher cost, the older muzzle-loaders were selected to remain in service instead. Realising that iron was more difficult to pierce with breech-loaded cannon, Armstrong designed rifled muzzle-loading guns, which proved successful; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported: "even the fondest believers in the invulnerability of our present ironclads were obliged to confess that against such artillery, at such ranges, their plates and sides were almost as penetrable as wooden ships."
The superior cannon of the <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a> brought them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First Opium War</a> in China, during the 19th century, British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications from afar, safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war in recorded history, the <a href="Anglo-Zanzibar%20War">Anglo-Zanzibar War</a> of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British cruisers. The cynical attitude towards recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term "<a href="cannon%20fodder">cannon fodder</a>", first used by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a>, in 1814; however, the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than "food for powder" was mentioned by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> as early as 1598, in <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>.

Cannon in the 20th and 21st centuries are usually divided into sub-categories and given separate names. Some of the most widely used types of modern cannon are howitzers, mortars, guns, and autocannon, although a few <a href="supergun">supergun</a>s—extremely large, custom-designed cannon—have also been constructed. <a href="Nuclear%20artillery">Nuclear artillery</a> was experimented with, but was abandoned as impractical. Modern artillery is used in a variety of roles, depending on its type. According to <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, the general role of artillery is to provide fire support, which is defined as "the application of fire, coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy, neutralize, or suppress the enemy."

When referring to cannon, the term "gun" is often used incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a <a href="indirect%20fire">flat trajectory</a>, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.

By the early 20th century, <a href="infantry%20weapon">infantry weapon</a>s had become more powerful, forcing most artillery away from the front lines. Despite the change to indirect fire, cannon proved highly effective during World War I, directly or indirectly causing over 75% of casualties. The onset of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> after the first few months of World War I greatly increased the demand for howitzers, as they were more suited at hitting targets in trenches. Furthermore, their shells carried more explosives than those of guns, and caused considerably less barrel wear. The German army had the advantage here as they began the war with many more howitzers than the French. World War I also saw the use of the <a href="Paris%20Gun">Paris Gun</a>, the longest-ranged gun ever fired. This calibre gun was used by the Germans against Paris and could hit targets more than away.
The Second World War sparked new developments in cannon technology. Among them were <a href="sabot">sabot rounds</a>, hollow-charge projectiles, and <a href="proximity%20fuse">proximity fuse</a>s, all of which increased the effectiveness of cannon against specific target. The proximity fuse emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944. Used to great effect in <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> projectiles, proximity fuses were fielded in both the <a href="European%20Theater%20of%20Operations">European</a> and <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific</a> Theatres of Operations; they were particularly useful against <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a>s and <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> planes. Although widely used in naval warfare, and in anti-air guns, both the British and Americans feared unexploded proximity fuses would be reverse engineered leading to them limiting its use in continental battles. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, however, the fuses became known as the American artillery's "Christmas present" for the German army because of their effectiveness against German personnel in the open, when they frequently dispersed attacks. <a href="Anti-tank%20gun">Anti-tank gun</a>s were also tremendously improved during the war: in 1939, the British used primarily <a href="Ordnance%20QF%202%20pounder">2 pounder</a> and <a href="Ordnance%20QF%206%20pounder">6 pounder</a> guns. By the end of the war, <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2017%20pounder">17 pounders</a> had proven much more effective against German tanks, and 32 pounders had entered development. Meanwhile, German tanks were continuously upgraded with better <a href="tank%20gun">main guns</a>, in addition to other improvements. For example, the <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a> was originally designed with a 37 mm gun, but was <a href="mass%20production">mass-produced</a> with a 50 mm cannon. To counter the threat of the Russian <a href="T-34">T-34</a>s, another, more powerful 50 mm gun was introduced, only to give way to a larger 75 mm cannon, which was in a fixed mount as the <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">StuG III</a>, the most-produced German World War II armoured fighting vehicle of any type. Despite the improved guns, production of the Panzer III was ended in 1943, as the tank still could not match the T-34, and was replaced by the <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> and <a href="Panzer%20tank">Panther</a> tanks. In 1944, the <a href="8.8%20cm%20KwK%2043">8.8 cm KwK 43</a> and many variations, entered service with the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>, and was used as both a tank main gun, and as the <a href="PaK%2043">PaK 43</a> anti-tank gun. One of the most powerful guns to see service in World War II, it was capable of destroying any <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> tank at very long ranges.
Despite being designed to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can be fired <a href="direct%20fire">directly</a>, as was done by the <a href="11th%20Marine%20Regiment%23Korean%20War">11th Marine Regiment</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chosin%20Reservoir">Battle of Chosin Reservoir</a>, during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Two <a href="Artillery%20battery%23Modern%20battery%20organization">field batteries</a> fired directly upon a <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they had no time to dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.
The tendency to create larger calibre cannon during the World Wars has reversed since. The <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their ageing pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the <a href="M777%20howitzer">M777</a> Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a>s. However, the 's planned armament includes the <a href="Zumwalt-class%20destroyer%23Advanced%20Gun%20System">Advanced Gun System (AGS)</a>, a pair of 155 mm guns, which fire the <a href="Long%20Range%20Land-Attack%20Projectile">Long Range Land-Attack Projectile</a>. The warhead, which weighs , has a <a href="Circular%20error%20probable">circular error of probability</a> of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to , further than that of the Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will fire 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give a "Zumwalt"-class destroyer the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are less expensive than a cruise missile but have a similar guidance capability.

Autocannons have an automatic firing mode, similar to that of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of <a href="rotary%20cannon">rotary autocannons</a>, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20 mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.

Most nations use rapid-fire cannon on light vehicles, replacing a more powerful, but heavier, tank gun. A typical autocannon is the <a href="25%20mm%20caliber">25 mm</a> "<a href="M242%20Bushmaster">Bushmaster</a>" <a href="chain%20gun">chain gun</a>, mounted on the <a href="LAV-25">LAV-25</a> and <a href="M2%20Bradley">M2 Bradley</a> <a href="Infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured vehicles</a>. Autocannons may be capable of a very high rate of fire, but ammunition is heavy and bulky, limiting the amount carried. For this reason, both the 25 mm Bushmaster and the 30 mm <a href="RARDEN">RARDEN</a> are deliberately designed with relatively low rates of fire. The typical rate of fire for a modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels, such as a rotary autocannon, can have rates of fire of more than several thousand rounds per minute. The fastest of these is the <a href="Gryazev-Shipunov%20GSh-6-23">GSh-6-23</a>, which has a rate of fire of over 10,000 rounds per minute.

Autocannons are often found in aircraft, where they replaced machine guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns.

The first documented installation of a cannon on an aircraft was on the Voisin Canon in 1911, displayed at the Paris Exposition that year.
By World War I, all of the major powers were experimenting with aircraft mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.

The first autocannon were developed during World War I as anti-aircraft guns, and one of these – the <a href="Coventry%20Ordnance%20Works">Coventry Ordnance Works</a> "<a href="COW%2037%20mm%20gun">COW 37 mm gun</a>" was installed in an aircraft but the war ended before it could be given a field trial and never became standard equipment in a production aircraft. Later trials had it fixed at a steep angle upwards in both the <a href="Vickers%20Type%20161">Vickers Type 161</a> and the <a href="Westland%20C.O.W.%20Gun%20Fighter">Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter</a>, an idea that would return later.
During this period autocannons became available and several fighters of the German "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" and the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Air%20Service">Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service</a> were fitted with 20mm cannon. They continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement, as the rate of fire was still too low and the complete installation too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun almost entirely. The cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during the course of World War II, and newer fighters such as the <a href="Hawker%20Tempest">Hawker Tempest</a> usually carried two or four versus the six <a href="M2%20Browning">.50 Browning machine guns</a> for US aircraft or eight to twelve <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M1919 Browning machine gun</a>s on earlier British aircraft. The <a href="Hispano-Suiza%20HS.404">Hispano-Suiza HS.404</a>, <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm cannon</a>, <a href="MG%20FF%20cannon">MG FF</a>, and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. Cannon, as with machine guns, were generally fixed to fire forwards (mounted in the wings, in the nose or fuselage, or in a <a href="pannier">pannier</a> under either); or were mounted in <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s on heavier aircraft. Both the Germans and Japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers, with the Germans calling guns so-installed "<a href="Schr%C3%A4ge%20Musik">Schräge Musik</a>". Schräge Musik derives from the German colloquialism for Jazz Music (the German word schräg means slanted or oblique)

Preceding the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> the high speeds aircraft were attaining led to a move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief that they would be useless in a <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a>, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a>. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the <a href="Fairchild%20Republic%20A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II</a>. The <a href="Lockheed%20AC-130">Lockheed AC-130</a> gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> role.

Cannon in general have the form of a truncated cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an <a href="explosive%20charge">explosive charge</a> and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its <a href="recoil">recoil</a> and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.

Field artillery cannon in Europe and the Americas were initially made most often of <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, though later forms were constructed of <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> and eventually <a href="steel">steel</a>. Bronze has several characteristics that made it preferable as a construction material: although it is relatively expensive, does not always alloy well, and can result in a final product that is "spongy about the bore", bronze is more flexible than iron and therefore less prone to bursting when exposed to high pressure; cast iron cannon are less expensive and more durable generally than bronze and withstand being fired more times without deteriorating. However, cast iron cannon have a tendency to burst without having shown any previous weakness or wear, and this makes them more dangerous to operate.

The older and more-stable forms of cannon were <a href="Muzzleloader">muzzle-loading</a> as opposed to <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading</a>— in order to be used they had to have their ordnance packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than inserted through the breech.

The following terms refer to the components or aspects of a classical western cannon (c. 1850) as illustrated here. In what follows, the words "near", "close", and "behind" will refer to those parts towards the thick, closed end of the piece, and "far", "front", "in front of", and "before" to the thinner, open end.


The main body of a cannon consists of three basic extensions: the foremost and the longest is called the "chase", the middle portion is the "reinforce", and the closest and briefest portion is the "<a href="cascabel%20%28artillery%29">cascabel</a>" or "cascable".

To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first gunpowder is poured down the bore. This is followed by a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of <a href="windage">windage</a> allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.

Any large, <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a>, muzzle-loading <a href="gun">gun</a>—used before the advent of <a href="breech-loading">breech-loading</a>, <a href="rifled">rifled</a> guns—may be referred to as a cannon, though once standardised names were assigned to different-sized cannon, the term specifically referred to a gun designed to fire a shot, as distinct from a <a href="demi-cannon">demi-cannon</a> – , <a href="culverin">culverin</a> – , or <a href="demi-culverin">demi-culverin</a> – . "<a href="Gun">Gun</a>" specifically refers to a type of cannon that fires projectiles at high speeds, and usually at relatively low angles; they have been used in warships, and as <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>. The term "cannon" is also used for <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>, a modern repeating weapon firing explosive projectiles. Cannon have been used extensively in fighter aircraft since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

In the 1770s, cannon operation worked as follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, and the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.

Before loading, the cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a <a href="plumb-bob">plummet</a>. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.

During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, a British gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag of powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the <a href="bagged%20charge">bagged charge</a> through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.

When a cannon had to be abandoned such as in a retreat or surrender, the touch hole of the cannon would be plugged flush with an iron spike, disabling the cannon (at least until metal boring tools could be used to remove the plug). This was called "spiking the cannon".

A gun was said to be "honeycombed" when the surface of the bore had cavities, or holes in it, caused either by corrosion or casting defects.

Historically, logs or poles have been used as decoys to mislead the enemy as to the strength of an emplacement. The "<a href="Quaker%20Gun">Quaker Gun</a> trick" was used by Colonel <a href="William%20Washington">William Washington</a>'s <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>; in 1780, approximately 100 Loyalists surrendered to them, rather than face bombardment. During the American Civil War, Quaker guns were also used by the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederates</a>, to compensate for their shortage of artillery. The decoy cannon were painted black at the "muzzle", and positioned behind fortifications to delay <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> attacks on those positions. On occasion, real gun carriages were used to complete the deception.

Cannon sounds have sometimes been used in classical pieces with a military theme. One of the best known examples of such a piece is <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>'s "<a href="1812%20Overture">1812 Overture</a>". The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear <a href="Earplug">ear protection</a>. The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Borodino">Battle of Borodino</a>, a critical battle in <a href="Napoleon%27s%20invasion%20of%20Russia">Napoleon's invasion of Russia</a>, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a> and <a href="conductor%20%28music%29">conductor</a> <a href="Antal%20Dor%C3%A1ti">Antal Doráti</a>'s 1958 recording of the <a href="Minnesota%20Orchestra">Minnesota Orchestra</a>. Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the "1812" on the American <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a>, a tradition started by <a href="Arthur%20Fiedler">Arthur Fiedler</a> of the <a href="Boston%20Pops">Boston Pops</a> in 1974.

The <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> band <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> also used cannon in their song "<a href="For%20Those%20About%20to%20Rock%20%28We%20Salute%20You%29">For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)</a>", and in live shows replica Napoleonic cannon and <a href="pyrotechnics">pyrotechnics</a> were used to perform the piece.

Cannons recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, <a href="Extractive%20metallurgy">electrolytic reduction treatment</a> is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in <a href="Purified%20water%23Deionization">deionized</a> water to remove the <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>, and is treated in <a href="tannic%20acid">tannic acid</a>, which prevents further <a href="rust">rust</a> and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannon on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a <a href="wax">wax</a> sealant. A coat of <a href="polyurethane">polyurethane</a> may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays. In 2011, archaeologists say six cannon recovered from a river in Panama that could have belonged to legendary pirate <a href="Henry%20Morgan">Henry Morgan</a> are being studied and could eventually be displayed after going through a restoration process.

Comet Hale–Bopp

Comet Hale–Bopp (<a href="Astronomical%20naming%20conventions%23Comets">formally designated</a> C/1995 O1) is a <a href="comet">comet</a> that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades.

Hale–Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995, separately by <a href="Alan%20Hale%20%28astronomer%29">Alan Hale</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Bopp">Thomas Bopp</a> prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a> on April 1, 1997. It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201811">Great Comet of 1811</a>. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the <a href="Great%20comet">Great Comet</a> of 1997.

The comet was discovered independently on July 23, 1995, by two observers, <a href="Alan%20Hale%20%28astronomer%29">Alan Hale</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Bopp">Thomas Bopp</a>, both in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 10.5 and lay near the <a href="globular%20cluster%20M70">globular cluster M70</a> in the constellation of <a href="Sagittarius%20%28constellation%29">Sagittarius</a>. Hale first established that there was no other <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a> near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he <a href="email">email</a>ed the <a href="Central%20Bureau%20for%20Astronomical%20Telegrams">Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams</a>, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.

Bopp did not own a <a href="telescope">telescope</a>. He was out with friends near <a href="Stanfield%2C%20Arizona">Stanfield, Arizona</a>, observing star clusters and <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a> when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a <a href="Western%20Union">Western Union</a> telegram. <a href="Brian%20G.%20Marsden">Brian G. Marsden</a>, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates."

The following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was given the designation C/1995 O1. The discovery was announced in <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> circular 6187.

Hale–Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2 <a href="astronomical%20units">astronomical units</a> (AU) from the Sun, placing it between <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> and by far the greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable <a href="coma%20%28cometary%29">coma</a>. A <a href="precovery">precovery</a> image taken at the <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Telescope">Anglo-Australian Telescope</a> in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13 AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (<a href="Comet%20Halley">Halley's Comet</a> was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its <a href="comet%20nucleus">comet nucleus</a> was 60±20 kilometres in diameter, approximately six times the size of <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley</a>.

Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a> in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets can be extremely unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later. <a href="Comet%20Kohoutek">Comet Kohoutek</a> in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and turned out to be unspectacular.

Hale–Bopp became visible to the <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a> in May 1996, and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with <a href="light%20pollution">light-polluted</a> skies.

The <a href="Internet">Internet</a> was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world became extremely popular. The Internet played a large role in encouraging the unprecedented public interest in comet Hale–Bopp.

As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2nd magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of <a href="Comet%20tail">tails</a>, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20March%209%2C%201997">solar eclipse</a> in <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and eastern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime. Hale–Bopp had its closest approach to Earth on March 22, 1997, at a distance of 1.315 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>.

As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997, the comet developed into a spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 <a href="degree%20%28angle%29">degrees</a> across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets are very close to the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> observers.

After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> observers than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569 days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the <a href="Great%20Comet%20of%201811">Great Comet of 1811</a>, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.

The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> from Sun, the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of the CO-driven coma. <a href="Herschel%20Space%20Observatory">Herschel Space Observatory</a> images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012, at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30th <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a>. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.

The comet likely made its previous <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a> 4,200 years ago, in July 2215 BCE. The estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4 AU, and it may have been observed in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> during the <a href="6th%20dynasty">6th dynasty</a> reign of the Pharaoh <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a> (Reign: 2247 - c. 2216 BCE). Pepi's <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a> at <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> contains a text referring to an "nhh-star" as a companion of the pharaoh in the heavens, where "" is the hieroglyph for long hair.

Hale–Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June 2215 BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215 BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the plane of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77 AU of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533 years, and it will next return to the inner <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (<a href="aphelion">aphelion</a>) will be about 370 AU, reduced from about 525 AU.

The estimated probability of Hale-Bopp's striking <a href="Earth">Earth</a> in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10 per orbit. However, given that the comet nucleus is around 60 km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35 km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×10 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5 km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×10 <a href="erg">erg</a>s, or 4.4×10 <a href="TNT%20equivalent">megatons</a>, about 44 times the estimated energy of the <a href="Alvarez%20hypothesis">K-T impact event</a>.

Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital <a href="inclination">inclination</a>s and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a <a href="sungrazing%20comet">sungrazing comet</a> through this process.

Comet Hale–Bopp was observed intensively by <a href="astronomy">astronomers</a> during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma <a href="Optical%20thickness">optically thick</a>. Based on the properties of the dust grains—high temperature, high <a href="albedo">albedo</a> and strong 10 μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.

Hale–Bopp showed the highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.

One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint <a href="sodium">sodium</a> tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of <a href="electric%20charge">neutral atoms</a> (not <a href="ion">ion</a>s), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.

The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner <a href="coma%20%28cometary%29">coma</a>, although not necessarily the <a href="comet%20nucleus">nucleus</a>. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding the nucleus, and "sputtering" of sodium from dust grains by <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating Hale–Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow and diffuse components of the tail may have different origins.

While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from the comet's head by <a href="radiation%20pressure">radiation pressure</a>.

The abundance of <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> in comet Hale–Bopp in the form of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> was found to be about twice that of Earth's <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the <a href="Origin%20of%20water%20on%20Earth">water on Earth</a>, they cannot be the only source.

Deuterium was also detected in many other <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in <a href="interstellar%20cloud">interstellar cloud</a>s, rather than in the <a href="solar%20nebula">solar nebula</a>. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45 <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s.

Spectroscopic observations of Hale–Bopp revealed the presence of many <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemicals</a>, several of which had never been detected in comets before. These complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus, or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet.

Hale–Bopp was the first comet where the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a> <a href="argon">argon</a> was detected. Noble gases are chemically inert and highly <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a>, and since different noble elements have different <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a> temperatures, they can be used for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. <a href="Krypton">Krypton</a> has a sublimation temperature of 16–20 K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40 K, but has at some point been warmer than 20 K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> region and then migrated outward to the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>.

Comet Hale–Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the material streaming away from these jets allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes.

In 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary <a href="comet%20nucleus">nucleus</a> to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30 km, with the main nucleus being about 70 km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180 km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.

Although observations using <a href="adaptive%20optics">adaptive optics</a> in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case had been found of a stable binary nucleus until the subsequent discovery of <a href="P/2006_VW139"></a>. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and <a href="planet">planet</a>s.

In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek (1950–2000) of <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston, Texas</a> took a <a href="charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a> image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called the <a href="Art%20Bell">Art Bell</a> radio program "<a href="Coast%20to%20Coast%20AM">Coast to Coast AM</a>" to announce that he had discovered a "Saturn-like object" following Hale–Bopp. <a href="unidentified%20flying%20object">UFO</a> enthusiasts, such as <a href="remote%20viewing">remote viewing</a> proponent <a href="Courtney%20Brown%20%28researcher%29">Courtney Brown</a>, soon concluded that there was an <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a> <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> following the comet.

Several astronomers, including Alan Hale, claimed the object was simply an 8.5-magnitude <a href="star">star</a>, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers <a href="Olivier%20R.%20Hainaut">Olivier Hainaut</a> and <a href="David%20J.%20Tholen">David Tholen</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a> stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.

A few months later, in March 1997, 39 members of the cult <a href="Heaven%27s%20Gate%20%28religious%20group%29">Heaven's Gate</a> committed mass suicide with the intention of teleporting to a spaceship they believed was flying behind the comet.

Nancy Lieder, a self-proclaimed <a href="contactee">contactee</a> who claims to receive messages from aliens through an implant in her brain, stated that Hale–Bopp was a fiction designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of <a href="Nibiru%20cataclysm">"Nibiru"</a> or "Planet X", a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth's rotation, causing global cataclysm. Although Lieder's original date for the apocalypse, May 2003, passed without incident, predictions of the imminent arrival of Nibiru continued by various conspiracy websites, most of whom tied it to the <a href="2012%20phenomenon">2012 phenomenon</a>.

Its lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant that Hale–Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of <a href="Comet%20Halley">Halley's Comet</a> in 1986, and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Hale–Bopp by April 9, 1997.

Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the farthest comet from the Sun discovered by amateurs, with the largest well-measured cometary nucleus known after <a href="95P/Chiron">95P/Chiron</a>, and it was visible to the naked eye for twice as long as the previous record-holder. It was also brighter than magnitude 0 for eight weeks, longer than any other recorded comet.

<a href="Carolyn%20S.%20Shoemaker">Carolyn Shoemaker</a> and her husband <a href="Eugene%20Merle%20Shoemaker">Gene</a>, both famous for co-discovering <a href="comet%20Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy%209">comet Shoemaker–Levy 9</a>, were involved in a car crash after photographing the comet. Gene died in the crash and his ashes were sent to the Moon aboard NASA's "<a href="Lunar%20Prospector">Lunar Prospector</a>" mission along with an image of Hale–Bopp, "the last comet that the Shoemakers observed together".

Constantine II of Scotland

Constantine, son of <a href="%C3%81ed%20mac%20Cin%C3%A1eda">Áed</a> (<a href="Middle%20Irish">Medieval Gaelic</a>: "Constantín mac Áeda"; <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Modern Gaelic</a>: "Còiseam mac Aoidh", known in most modern regnal lists as Constantine II; born no later than 879; died 952) was an early <a href="King%20of%20Scotland">King of Scotland</a>, known then by the Gaelic name "Alba". The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Kingdom of Alba</a>, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was situated in modern-day Scotland. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the <a href="River%20Tay">River Tay</a>. Its southern limit was the <a href="River%20Forth">River Forth</a>, northwards it extended towards the <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a> and perhaps to <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather <a href="Kenneth%20I%20of%20Scotland">Kenneth I of Scotland</a> (Cináed mac Ailpín, died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as <a href="king%20of%20the%20Picts">king of the Picts</a>. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of <a href="Pictland">Pictland</a> and the <a href="origins%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Alba">origins of the Kingdom of Alba</a> are traced to Constantine's lifetime.

His reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of <a href="Viking">Viking</a> rulers in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, particularly the <a href="U%C3%AD%20%C3%8Dmair">Uí Ímair</a> ("the grandsons of Ímar", or <a href="Ivar%20the%20Boneless">Ivar the Boneless</a>). During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, later the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>, extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King <a href="Athelstan%20of%20England">Æthelstan</a> was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the <a href="Strathclyde%20Britons">Strathclyde Britons</a> and the Viking king of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, invaded Æthelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great <a href="battle%20of%20Brunanburh">battle of Brunanburh</a>. In 943 Constantine abdicated the throne and retired to the <a href="C%C3%A9li%20D%C3%A9">Céli Dé</a> (Culdee) <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20on%20the%20Rock">monastery of St Andrews</a> where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor's son <a href="Malcolm%20I%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm I</a> (Máel Coluim mac Domnaill).

Constantine's reign of 43 years, exceeded in Scotland only by that of King <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William the Lion</a> before the <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a> in 1603, is believed to have played a defining part in the <a href="gaelicisation">gaelicisation</a> of Pictland, in which his patronage of the Irish Céli Dé monastic reformers was a significant factor. During his reign the words "Scots" and "Scotland" () are first used to mean part of what is now <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The earliest evidence for the ecclesiastical and administrative institutions which would last until the <a href="Davidian%20Revolution">Davidian Revolution</a> also appears at this time.

Compared to neighbouring Ireland and <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>, few records of 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source from the period is the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Alba">Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</a>", a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to <a href="Kenneth%20II%20of%20Scotland">Kenneth II</a> (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the <a href="Poppleton%20Manuscript">Poppleton Manuscript</a>, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest <a href="genealogical">genealogical</a> records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date from the end of the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.

For narrative history the principal sources are the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" and the <a href="Irish%20annals">Irish annals</a>. The evidence from <a href="charter">charter</a>s created in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n <a href="sagas">sagas</a> describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint <a href="Cathr%C3%B3e%20of%20Metz">Cathróe of Metz</a>, a work of <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> written in Germany at the end of the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.

While the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> and Atlantic coasts—the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland—are non-existent, and <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> and <a href="toponymy">toponymy</a> are of primary importance.

The dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> was the northern <a href="Pictish">Pictish</a> kingdom of <a href="Fortriu">Fortriu</a> on the shores of the <a href="Moray%20Firth">Moray Firth</a>. By the 9th century, the <a href="Gaels">Gaels</a> of <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Riata">Dál Riata</a> (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of <a href="Constant%C3%ADn%20of%20the%20Picts">Constantín mac Fergusa</a> (Constantine son of Fergus). Constantín's family dominated Fortriu after 789 and perhaps, if Constantín was a kinsman of <a href="%C3%93engus%20I%20of%20the%20Picts">Óengus I of the Picts</a> (Óengus son of Fergus), from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>" in which King <a href="Uen%20of%20the%20Picts">Uen</a> of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constantín's nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, <a href="%C3%81ed%20mac%20Boanta">Áed mac Boanta</a>, "and others almost innumerable" were killed. These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 <a href="Kenneth%20I%20of%20Scotland">Kenneth MacAlpin</a> had emerged as the winner.

Later <a href="national%20myth">national myth</a> made Kenneth MacAlpin the creator of the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Scotland">kingdom of Scotland</a>, the founding of which was dated from 843, the year in which he was said to have destroyed the Picts and inaugurated a new era. The historical record for 9th-century Scotland is meagre, but the Irish annals and the 10th-century "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" agree that Kenneth was a Pictish king, and call him "king of the Picts" at his death. The same style is used of Kenneth's brother <a href="Donald%20I%20of%20Scotland">Donald I</a> (Domnall mac Ailpín) and sons <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Scotland">Constantine I</a> (Constantín mac Cináeda) and <a href="%C3%81ed%20of%20Scotland">Áed</a> (Áed mac Cináeda).

The kingdom ruled by Kenneth's descendants—older works used the name <a href="House%20of%20Alpin">House of Alpin</a> to describe them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to "Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín" ("the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin")—lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the <a href="River%20Tay">River Tay</a>. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> in the south to the <a href="Mounth">Mounth</a> in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain—<a href="Druim%20Alban">Druim Alban</a>—is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of <a href="Kincardineshire">Mearns</a>, <a href="Forfarshire">Forfar</a>, <a href="Perthshire">Perth</a>, Fife, and <a href="Kinross-shire">Kinross</a>. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are <a href="Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a>, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and "Cell Rígmonaid" (modern <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>).

Kenneth's son Constantine died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from Northumbria in 874. According to the king lists, he was counted the 70th and last king of the Picts in later times.

In 899 <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, died leaving his son <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a> as ruler of Britain south of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> and his daughter <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a> and son-in-law <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20ealdorman%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred</a> ruling the western, English part of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>. The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern Britain is less clear. King <a href="Eohric%20of%20East%20Anglia">Eohric</a> was probably ruling in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of <a href="Guthfrith%2C%20King%20of%20York">Guthfrith of York</a> in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by <a href="Eadulf%20I%20of%20Bernicia">Eadulf</a>, based at <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a> who controlled the lands from the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> or <a href="River%20Tees">River Tees</a> to the Forth in the north.

In Ireland, <a href="Flann%20Sinna">Flann Sinna</a>, married to Constantine's aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and <a href="Norse-Gaels">Norse-Gaels</a> of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> and the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Firth of Clyde</a>. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law <a href="Cerball%20mac%20Muirec%C3%A1in">Cerball mac Muirecáin</a>, and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.

To the south-west of Constantine's lands lay the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">kingdom of Strathclyde</a>. This extended north into the <a href="Lennox%20%28district%29">Lennox</a>, east to the River Forth, and south into the <a href="Southern%20Uplands">Southern Uplands</a>. In 900 it was probably ruled by King <a href="Dyfnwal%20I%20of%20Strathclyde">Dyfnwal</a>.

The situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Riata">Dál Riata</a> in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The <a href="Francia">Frankish</a> "<a href="Annales%20Bertiniani">Annales Bertiniani</a>" may record the conquest of the <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a>, the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849. In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a> or the <a href="Northern%20Isles">Northern Isles</a> at this time is debated.

<a href="%C3%81ed%20of%20Scotland">Áed</a>, Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's uncle and namesake <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Scotland">Constantine I</a> in 876 but was killed in 878. Áed's short reign is glossed as being of no importance by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantine II cannot have been born any later than the year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born a few years earlier, during the reign of his uncle Constantine I.

After Áed's death, there is a two-decade gap until the death of <a href="Donald%20II%20of%20Scotland">Donald II</a> (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and Donald II is corrupt in the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba", and in this case the "Chronicle" is at variance with every other king list. According to the "Chronicle", Áed was followed by <a href="Eochaid%20of%20Scotland">Eochaid</a>, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with <a href="Giric%20of%20Scotland">Giric</a>, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a> and <a href="Archie%20Duncan%20%28historian%29">Archie Duncan</a> with Giric's reign.

Woolf suggests that Constantine and his cousin Donald may have passed Giric's reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive <a href="High%20Kings%20of%20Ireland">High Kings of Ireland</a>, <a href="%C3%81ed%20Findliath">Áed Findliath</a> and <a href="Flann%20Sinna">Flann Sinna</a>. Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin Donald II became king. Donald's reputation is suggested by the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "dasachtach", a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the 11th-century writings of <a href="Flann%20Mainistrech">Flann Mainistrech</a>, echoed by his description in the "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Berchan">Prophecy of Berchan</a>" as "the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth". Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at <a href="Dunnottar">Dunnottar</a> in the Mearns in 900. Constantine succeeded him as king.

The earliest event recorded in the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" in Constantine's reign is an attack by Vikings and the plundering of Dunkeld "and all Albania" in his third year. This is the first use of the word Albania, the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> form of the <a href="Old%20Irish%20language">Old Irish</a> "Alba", in the "Chronicle" which until then describes the lands ruled by the descendants of Cináed as Pictavia.

These Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> in 902, but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900. The "Chronicle" states that the Northmen were killed in "Srath Erenn", which is confirmed by the "Annals of Ulster" which records the death of <a href="%C3%8Dmar%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Ímar grandson of Ímar</a> and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904. This Ímar was the first of the <a href="U%C3%AD%20%C3%8Dmair">Uí Ímair</a>, that is the grandsons of Ímar, to be reported; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín's reign. The "<a href="Fragmentary%20Annals%20of%20Ireland">Fragmentary Annals of Ireland</a>" contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint <a href="Columba">Columba</a> following fasting and prayer. An entry in the "<a href="Chronicon%20Scotorum">Chronicon Scotorum</a>" under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.

The next event reported by the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" is dated to 906. This records that:King Constantine and Bishop <a href="Cellach%20I%20of%20Cennr%C3%ADgmonaid">Cellach</a> met at the "Hill of Belief" near the royal city of <a href="Scone%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Scone</a> and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept "pariter cum Scottis". The meaning of this entry, and its significance, have been the subject of debate.

The phrase "pariter cum Scottis" in the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> text of the "Chronicle" has been translated in several ways. <a href="William%20Forbes%20Skene">William Forbes Skene</a> and <a href="Alan%20Orr%20Anderson">Alan Orr Anderson</a> proposed that it should be read as "in conformity with the customs of the Gaels", relating it to the claims in the king lists that Giric liberated the church from secular oppression and adopted Irish customs. It has been read as "together with the Gaels", suggesting either public participation or the presence of Gaels from the western coasts as well as the people of the east coast. Finally, it is suggested that it was the ceremony which followed "the custom of the Gaels" and not the agreements.

The idea that this gathering agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that it was an important step in the <a href="gaelicisation">gaelicisation</a> of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may be that the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.

Following the events at Scone, there is little of substance reported for a decade. A story in the "Fragmentary Annals of Ireland", perhaps referring to events some time after 911, claims that Queen Æthelflæd, who ruled in Mercia, allied with the Irish and northern rulers against the Norsemen on the Irish sea coasts of Northumbria. The "Annals of Ulster" record the defeat of an Irish fleet from the kingdom of <a href="Ulaid">Ulaid</a> by Vikings "on the coast of England" at about this time.

In this period the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" reports the death of <a href="Cormac%20mac%20Cuilenn%C3%A1in">Cormac mac Cuilennáin</a>, <a href="king%20of%20Munster">king of Munster</a>, in the eighth year of Constantine's reign. This is followed by an undated entry which was formerly read as "In his time Domnall [i.e. Dyfnwal], king of the [Strathclyde] Britons died, and Domnall son of Áed was elected". This was thought to record the election of a brother of Constantine named Domnall to the kingship of the Britons of Strathclyde and was seen as early evidence of the domination of Strathclyde by the kings of Alba. The entry in question is now read as "...Dynfwal... and Domnall son Áed <a href="king%20of%20Ailech">king of Ailech</a> died", this <a href="Domnall%20Dabaill">Domnall</a> being a son of <a href="%C3%81ed%20Findliath">Áed Findliath</a> who died on 915. Finally, the deaths of Flann Sinna and <a href="Niall%20Gl%C3%BAndub">Niall Glúndub</a> are recorded.

There are more reports of Viking fleets in the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> from 914 onwards. By 916 fleets under <a href="Sihtric%20C%C3%A1ech">Sihtric Cáech</a> and <a href="Ragnall%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Ragnall</a>, said to be grandsons of Ímar (that is, they belonged to the same <a href="U%C3%AD%20%C3%8Dmair">Uí Ímair</a> kindred as the Ímar who was killed in 904), were very active in Ireland. Sihtric inflicted a heavy defeat on the armies of <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a> and retook Dublin in 917. The following year Ragnall appears to have returned across the Irish sea intent on establishing himself as king at <a href="York">York</a>. The only precisely dated event in the summer of 918 is the death of Queen Æthelflæd on 918 at <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth, Staffordshire</a>. Æthelflæd had been negotiating with the Northumbrians to obtain their submission, but her death put an end to this and her successor, her brother <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a>, was occupied with securing control of Mercia.

The northern part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by <a href="Ealdred%20I%20of%20Bernicia">Ealdred</a> son of <a href="Eadulf%20I%20of%20Bernicia">Eadulf</a> since 913. Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and this led to a battle somewhere on the banks of the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a>, probably at <a href="Corbridge">Corbridge</a> where <a href="Dere%20Street">Dere Street</a> crosses the river. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Corbridge">Battle of Corbridge</a> appears to have been indecisive; the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" is alone in giving Constantine the victory.

The report of the battle in the "Annals of Ulster" says that none of the kings or <a href="mormaer">mormaer</a>s among the men of Alba were killed. This is the first surviving use of the word mormaer; other than the knowledge that Constantine's kingdom had its own bishop or bishops and royal villas, this is the only hint to the institutions of the kingdom.

After Corbridge, Ragnall enjoyed only a short respite. In the south, Alfred's son Edward had rapidly secured control of Mercia and had a <a href="burh">burh</a> constructed at <a href="Bakewell">Bakewell</a> in the <a href="Peak%20District">Peak District</a> from which his armies could easily strike north. An army from Dublin led by Ragnall's kinsman Sihtric struck at north-western Mercia in 919, but in 920 or 921 Edward met with Ragnall and other kings. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" states that these king "chose Edward as father and lord". Among the other kings present were Constantine, Ealdred son of Eadwulf, and the king of Strathclyde, <a href="Owain%20ap%20Dyfnwal%20%28fl.%20934%29">Owain ap Dyfnwal</a>. Here, again, a new term appears in the record, the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" for the first time using the word "scottas", from which Scots derives, to describe the inhabitants of Constantine's kingdom in its report of these events.

Edward died in 924. His realms appear to have been divided with the West Saxons recognising <a href="%C3%86lfweard%20of%20Wessex">Ælfweard</a> while the Mercians chose <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> who had been raised at Æthelflæd's court. Ælfweard died within weeks of his father and Æthelstan was inaugurated as king of all of Edward's lands in 925.

By 926 Sihtric had evidently acknowledged <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within the year he may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, <a href="Gofraid%20ua%20%C3%8Dmair">Gofraid</a>, who had remained as his deputy in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, the kingdom of the English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>.

<a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>'s chronicle suggests that Æthelstan faced opposition from Constantine, from Owain, and from the Welsh kings. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> writes that Gofraid, together with Sihtric's young son <a href="Olaf%20Cuaran">Olaf Cuaran</a> fled north and received refuge from Constantine, which led to war with Æthelstan. A meeting at <a href="Eamont%20Bridge">Eamont Bridge</a> on 927 was sealed by an agreement that Constantine, Owain, <a href="Hywel%20Dda">Hywel Dda</a>, and Ealdred would "renounce all idolatry": that is, they would not ally with the Viking kings. William states that Æthelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine, probably <a href="Indulf%20of%20Scotland">Indulf</a> (Ildulb mac Constantín), during the conference.

Æthelstan followed up his advances in the north by securing the recognition of the Welsh kings. For the next seven years, the record of events in the north is blank. Æthelstan's court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Owain. This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.

Æthelstan's campaign is reported by in brief by the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", and later chroniclers such as John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a> add detail to that bald account. Æthelstan's army began gathering at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> by 934, and reached <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> by . He was accompanied by many leaders, including the Welsh kings Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and <a href="Morgan%20ab%20Owain">Morgan ab Owain</a>. From Mercia the army went north, stopping at <a href="Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a>, before resuming the march accompanied by a fleet of ships. Owain was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, by which a much larger area, including <a href="Sutherland">Sutherland</a>, is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine's personal authority extended so far north, and while the attacks may have been directed at his allies, they may also have been simple looting expeditions.

The "<a href="Annals%20of%20Clonmacnoise">Annals of Clonmacnoise</a>" state that "the Scottish men compelled [Æthelstan] to return without any great victory", while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition. A negotiated settlement may have ended matters: according to John of Worcester, a son of Constantine was given as a hostage to Æthelstan and Constantine himself accompanied the English king on his return south. He witnessed a charter with Æthelstan at <a href="Buckingham">Buckingham</a> on 934 in which he is described as "subregulus", that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. The following year, Constantine was again in England at Æthelstan's court, this time at <a href="Cirencester">Cirencester</a> where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Owain and Hywel Dda, who subscribed to the diploma. At Christmas of 935, Owain was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.

Following his disappearance from Æthelstan's court after 935, there is no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Owain and <a href="Olaf%20III%20Guthfrithson">Olaf Guthfrithson</a> of Dublin, Constantine invaded England. The resulting <a href="battle%20of%20Brunanburh">battle of Brunanburh</a>—"Dún Brunde"—is reported in the "Annals of Ulster" as follows:a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought... in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen.  ...And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory. The battle was remembered in England a generation later as "the Great Battle". When reporting the battle, the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the "hoary" Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" confirms. The "Annals of Clonmacnoise" give his name as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with <a href="Bromborough">Bromborough</a> on the <a href="Wirral%20Peninsula">Wirral</a> the most favoured location.

Brunanburh, for all that it had been a famous and bloody battle, settled nothing. On 939 Æthelstan, the "pillar of the dignity of the western world" in the words of the "Annals of Ulster", died at <a href="Malmesbury">Malmesbury</a>. He was succeeded by his brother <a href="Edmund%20I%20of%20England">Edmund</a>, then aged 18. Æthelstan's empire, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amlaíb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constantín's reign rebuilding the empire.

For Constantine's last years as king there is only the meagre record of the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba". The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of <a href="Dubacan%20of%20Angus">Dubacan</a>, <a href="mormaer%20of%20Angus">mormaer of Angus</a> or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this occasion the title mormaer is attached to a geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.

By the early 940s Constantine was an old man in his late sixties or seventies. The kingdom of Alba was too new to be said to have a customary rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son <a href="Indulf%20of%20Scotland">Indulf</a>, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, <a href="Malcolm%20I%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm I</a>. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Berch%C3%A1n">Prophecy of Berchán</a>", a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.

Although his retirement may have been involuntary, the "Life" of <a href="Cathr%C3%B3e%20of%20Metz">Cathróe of Metz</a> and the "Prophecy of Berchán" portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where he is said to have been <a href="abbot">abbot</a>, was probably that of <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20on%20the%20Rock">St Andrews</a>. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming <a href="C%C3%A9li%20D%C3%A9">Céli Dé</a> (Culdee) movement. The Céli Dé were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France.

Seven years later the "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba" says:[Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the <a href="river%20Tees">river Tees</a>, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.

Constantine's death in 952 is recorded by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, <a href="Constantine%20III%20of%20Scotland">Constantine III</a> (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid was married to a daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.

The form of kingdom which appeared in Constantine's reign continued in much the same way until the <a href="Davidian%20Revolution">Davidian Revolution</a> in the 12th century. As with his ecclesiastical reforms, his political legacy was the creation of a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.

Cricket World Cup

The ICC Cricket World Cup is the <a href="World%20cup%20competition">international championship</a> of <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> (ODI) <a href="cricket">cricket</a>. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.

The first World Cup was organised <a href="1975%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">in England in June 1975</a>, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate <a href="Women%27s%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">Women's Cricket World Cup</a> had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a <a href="1912%20Triangular%20Tournament">triangular tournament</a> of <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> was played between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>, <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a> and <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the <a href="1987%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1987 tournament</a> onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an <a href="Cricket%20World%20Cup%20hosts%23Unofficial%20rotation%20system">unofficial rotation system</a>, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.

The World Cup is open to all members of the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the <a href="World%20Cricket%20League">World Cricket League</a> and the <a href="ICC%20World%20Cup%20Qualifier">ICC World Cup Qualifier</a>. A total of <a href="%23Overview">twenty teams</a> have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; <a href="2019%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">the next edition</a> in 2019 will have only ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>, <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> (twice each), <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when <a href="Kenya%20national%20cricket%20team">Kenya</a> made the semi-finals of the <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 tournament</a>.

The <a href="Canadian%20cricket%20team%20in%20the%20United%20States%20in%201844">first international cricket match</a> was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844. However, the first credited <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> was played in 1877 between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>, and the two teams competed regularly for <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a> in subsequent years. <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a> was admitted to Test status in 1889. Representative cricket teams were selected to <a href="International%20structure%20of%20cricket">tour</a> each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the <a href="1900%20Summer%20Olympics">1900 Paris Games</a>, where <a href="Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics">Great Britain</a> defeated <a href="France%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics">France</a> to win the <a href="Gold%20medal%23Olympic%20Games">gold medal</a>. This was the only appearance of cricket at the <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympics</a>.

The first multilateral competition at international level was the <a href="1912%20Triangular%20Tournament">1912 Triangular Tournament</a>, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a "surfeit of cricket". Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular <a href="Asian%20Test%20Championship">Asian Test Championship</a> in 1999.

The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> in 1928, <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> in 1930, <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in 1932, and <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.

In the early 1960s, English <a href="county%20cricket">county cricket</a> teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in <a href="1962%20English%20cricket%20season">1962</a> with a four-team <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">knockout competition</a> known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup, and continuing with the inaugural <a href="Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">Gillette Cup</a> in <a href="1963%20English%20cricket%20season">1963</a>, <a href="Limited%20overs%20cricket">one-day cricket</a> grew in popularity in England. A national <a href="National%20League%20%28cricket%29">Sunday League</a> was formed in <a href="1969%20English%20cricket%20season">1969</a>. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201970%E2%80%9371">1971</a>, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> game with eight balls per over.

In the late 1970s, <a href="Kerry%20Packer">Kerry Packer</a> established the rival <a href="World%20Series%20Cricket">World Series Cricket</a> (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of <a href="One%20Day%20International%20cricket">One Day International cricket</a>, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.

The <a href="1975%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">inaugural Cricket World Cup</a> was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June. The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors <a href="Prudential%20plc">Prudential plc</a>. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing <a href="cricket%20clothing%20and%20equipment">cricket whites</a> and using red <a href="cricket%20ball">cricket ball</a>s.

Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a>, Pakistan, and the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from <a href="East%20African%20cricket%20team">East Africa</a>. One notable omission was <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>, who were <a href="Sporting%20boycott%20of%20South%20Africa%20during%20the%20apartheid%20era%23Cricket">banned from international cricket</a> due to <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> in the final at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>.Roy Fredricks of West Indies was the first batsmen who got hit-wicket in ODI during the 1975 World Cup final.

The <a href="1979%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1979 World Cup</a> saw the introduction of the <a href="ICC%20Trophy">ICC Trophy</a> competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup, with Sri Lanka and <a href="Canadian%20cricket%20team">Canada</a> qualifying. The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.

The <a href="1983%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1983 event</a> was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and <a href="Zimbabwe%20national%20cricket%20team">Zimbabwe</a> qualified through the ICC Trophy. A <a href="Fielding%20restrictions%20%28cricket%29">fielding circle</a> was introduced, away from the <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stumps</a>. Four <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fieldsmen</a> needed to be inside it at all times. The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66–1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.

India and Pakistan jointly hosted the <a href="1987%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1987 tournament</a>, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> compared with England's summer. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.

The <a href="1992%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1992 World Cup</a>, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, <a href="Day/Night%20ODI">day/night</a> matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the <a href="Sporting%20boycott%20of%20South%20Africa%20during%20the%20apartheid%20era">international sports boycott</a>. Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.

The <a href="1996%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1996 championship</a> was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches. In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at <a href="Eden%20Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> after the hosts lost eight <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance. Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>.

In 1999 the <a href="1999%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">event</a> was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands. Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match. They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African <a href="batsman">batsmen</a> <a href="Lance%20Klusener">Lance Klusener</a> and <a href="Allan%20Donald">Allan Donald</a> saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be <a href="run%20out">run out</a>. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.

South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the <a href="2003%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 World Cup</a>. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. <a href="Kenya%20national%20cricket%20team">Kenya</a>'s victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others – and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns – enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate. In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.

In <a href="2007%20ICC%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007</a> the tournament was hosted by the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> and expanded to sixteen teams. Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach <a href="Bob%20Woolmer">Bob Woolmer</a> was found dead in his hotel room. Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure. Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.

India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the <a href="2011%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2011 Cricket World Cup</a>. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the <a href="2009%20attack%20on%20the%20Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009</a>, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries. The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen. Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999. <a href="Indian%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> won their second World Cup title by beating <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil. 

Australia and New Zealand jointly hosted the <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 Cricket World Cup</a>. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.

The Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 Cricket World Cup</a>. The top two teams of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9313%20ICC%20World%20Cricket%20League%20Championship">2011–13 ICC World Cricket League Championship</a> qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of <a href="2011%20ICC%20World%20Cricket%20League%20Division%20Two">2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two</a> and the top two teams of the <a href="2013%20ICC%20World%20Cricket%20League%20Division%20Three">2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three</a> in the <a href="2014%20Cricket%20World%20Cup%20Qualifier">World Cup Qualifier</a> to decide the remaining two places.

Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the <a href="1979%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">second World Cup</a>, where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the <a href="ICC%20Trophy">ICC Trophy</a>. The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The <a href="World%20Cricket%20League">World Cricket League</a> (administered by the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a>) is the qualification system provided to allow the <a href="ICC%20associate%20membership">Associate</a> and <a href="List%20of%20International%20Cricket%20Council%20members%23Affiliate%20Members">Affiliate</a> members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name "ICC Trophy" has been changed to "ICC World Cup Qualifier".

Under the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.

Process summary in chronological order (2011-2014):

The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four. The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">knock-out</a> stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the <a href="round-robin%20tournament">round-robin</a> group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals. The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams. The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.

A distinct format was used for the <a href="1999%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1999</a> and <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003</a> World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the "Super 6". The "Super 6" teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages. The top four teams from the "Super 6" stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.

The format used in the <a href="2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007 World Cup</a> involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four. Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the "Super 8" round. The "Super 8" teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the "Super 8" stage. The top four teams from the "Super 8" round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.

The format used in the <a href="2011%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2011</a> and <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015</a> World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a <a href="round-robin%20tournament">round-robin format</a>. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.

It is proposed that in <a href="2019%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2019 World Cup</a>, the number of teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This would be similar to the one used in <a href="1992%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1992 World Cup</a>.

The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup. The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from <a href="Garrard%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Garrard & Co</a> over a period of two months.

The current trophy is made from silver and <a href="gilding">gilt</a>, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stumps</a> and <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a>, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: <a href="batting%20%28cricket%29">batting</a>, <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowling</a> and <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielding</a>, while the globe characterises a <a href="cricket%20ball">cricket ball</a>. The seam is tilted to symbolize the <a href="axial%20tilt">axial tilt</a> of the Earth. It stands 60 centimetres high and weighs approximately 11 kilograms. The names of the previous winners are <a href="engraving">engraved</a> on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.

The tournament is one of the world's most-viewed sporting events. The <a href="2011%20Cricket%20World%20Cup%20final">2011 Cricket World Cup final</a> was <a href="broadcasting">televised</a> in over 200 countries to over 2.2 billion television viewers. <a href="Sports%20television%20broadcast%20contracts">Television rights</a>, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1 billion, and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500 million. The <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 Cricket World Cup</a> matches were attended by 626,845 people, while the <a href="2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007 Cricket World Cup</a> sold more than 672,000 tickets. The 2015 World Cup Sold over 1.1 million tickets which was a Record .

Successive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the <a href="zebra">zebra</a>. An orange <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a> known as "Mello" was the <a href="mascot">mascot</a> for the <a href="2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007 Cricket World Cup</a>. <a href="Stumpy%20%28mascot%29">Stumpy</a>, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.

On 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a>.

The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.

England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day. The <a href="1987%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1987 Cricket World Cup</a> was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.

Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a> in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> in 2007.

Twenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, five of which have won the title. The <a href="West%20Indies%20national%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> won the first two tournaments, <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> has won five, <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> has won two, while <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team">Sri Lanka</a> have each won once. The West Indies (<a href="1975%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1975</a> and <a href="1979%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1979</a>) and Australia (<a href="1999%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1999</a>, <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003</a> and <a href="2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007</a>) are the only teams to have won consecutive titles. Australia has played in seven of the eleven finals (1975, <a href="1987%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1987</a>, <a href="1996%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1996</a>, 1999, 2003, 2007, <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015</a>). <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a> has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, <a href="1992%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1992</a>). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by <a href="Kenya%20national%20cricket%20team">Kenya</a> in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by <a href="Ireland%20cricket%20team">Ireland</a> in 2007.

Sri Lanka as a co-host of the 1996 Cricket World Cup was the first host to win the tournament though the final was held in Pakistan. India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country. Australia repeated the feat in 2015. England is the only other host to have made the final, in 1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003. In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively. <a href="Australia">Australia</a> in 1992, <a href="England">England</a> in 1999, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> in 2003, and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in the first round.

Charles I of England

Charles I (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649) was the monarch over the three kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.

Charles was born into the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a> as the second son of <a href="King%20James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">King James VI of Scotland</a>, but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He became <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland on the death of his elder brother, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the <a href="Spanish%20Habsburg">Spanish Habsburg</a> princess <a href="Maria%20Anna%20of%20Spain">Maria Anna</a> culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> princess <a href="Henrietta%20Maria%20of%20France">Henrietta Maria of France</a> instead.

After his succession, Charles quarrelled with the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a>, which sought to curb his <a href="royal%20prerogative">royal prerogative</a>. Charles believed in the <a href="divine%20right%20of%20kings">divine right of kings</a> and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical <a href="absolute%20monarch">absolute monarch</a>. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, generated the antipathy and mistrust of <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> groups such as the English <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s and Scottish <a href="Covenanter">Covenanter</a>s, who thought his views were too Catholic. He supported <a href="high%20church">high church</a> <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> ecclesiastics, such as <a href="Richard%20Montagu">Richard Montagu</a> and <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, and failed to aid <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> forces successfully during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. His attempts to force the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> to adopt high Anglican practices led to the <a href="Bishops%27%20Wars">Bishops' Wars</a>, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments, and helped precipitate his own downfall.

From 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a> had consolidated its control over England. Charles was <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20for%20the%20trial%20of%20King%20Charles%20I">tried</a>, convicted, and <a href="Execution%20of%20Charles%20I">executed</a> for <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a> was declared. The monarchy would be <a href="English%20Restoration">restored</a> to Charles's son, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, in 1660.

The second son of King <a href="James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> and <a href="Anne%20of%20Denmark">Anne of Denmark</a>, Charles was born in <a href="Dunfermline%20Palace">Dunfermline Palace</a>, <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, on 19 November 1600. At a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> ceremony in the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a> of <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood Palace</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by <a href="David%20Lindsay%20%28d.%201613%29">David Lindsay</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ross%20%28Scotland%29">Bishop of Ross</a>, and created <a href="Duke%20of%20Albany">Duke of Albany</a>, the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland, with the <a href="subsidiary%20title">subsidiary title</a>s of <a href="Earl%20of%20Ormond%20%28Scottish%29">Marquess of Ormond</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Ross">Earl of Ross</a> and Lord Ardmannoch.

James VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, and when she died childless in March 1603, he became <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> as James I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant, and while his parents and older siblings left for <a href="England">England</a> in April and early June that year, due to his fragile health, he remained in Scotland with his father's friend <a href="Alexander%20Seton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Dunfermline">Lord Fyvie</a>, appointed as his guardian.

By 1604, when Charles was three-and-a-half, he was able to walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend most of the rest of his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier <a href="Robert%20Carey%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Monmouth">Sir Robert Carey</a>, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help strengthen his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.

In January 1605, Charles was created <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a>, as is customary in the case of the English sovereign's second son, and made a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight of the Bath</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Murray%20%28provost%20of%20Eton%29">Thomas Murray</a>, a <a href="Presbyterianism">presbyterian</a> Scot, was appointed as a tutor. Charles learnt the usual subjects of classics, languages, mathematics and religion. In 1611, he was made a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a>.

Eventually, Charles apparently conquered his physical infirmity, which might have been caused by <a href="rickets">rickets</a>. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry died at the age of 18 of what is suspected to have been <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> (or possibly <a href="porphyria">porphyria</a>). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including <a href="Duke%20of%20Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Rothesay">Duke of Rothesay</a>). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>.

In 1613, his sister <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a> married <a href="Frederick%20V%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Frederick V, Elector Palatine</a>, and moved to <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. In 1617, the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Archduke Ferdinand of Austria</a>, a Catholic, was elected <a href="king%20of%20Bohemia">king of Bohemia</a>. The following year, the <a href="Bohemian%20Revolt">Bohemians rebelled</a>, <a href="Defenestrations%20of%20Prague%23Second%20Defenestration%20of%20Prague">defenestrating the Catholic governors</a>. In August 1619, the Bohemian <a href="Diet%20%28assembly%29">diet</a> chose as their monarch Frederick V, who was leader of the <a href="Protestant%20Union">Protestant Union</a>, while Ferdinand was elected <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in the <a href="imperial%20election%20of%201619">imperial election</a>. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">English Parliament</a> and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Mountain">Battle of White Mountain</a> near <a href="Prague">Prague</a> and his hereditary lands in the <a href="Electoral%20Palatinate">Electoral Palatinate</a> were <a href="Palatinate%20campaign">invaded by a Habsburg force</a> from the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess <a href="Maria%20Anna%20of%20Spain">Maria Anna of Spain</a>, and began to see the <a href="Spanish%20match">Spanish match</a> as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.

Unfortunately for James, negotiation with Spain proved generally unpopular, both with the public and with James's court. The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of <a href="recusancy">recusancy</a> laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. James's <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, was impeached before the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> for corruption. The <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> was the first since 1459 without the king's official sanction in the form of a <a href="bill%20of%20attainder">bill of attainder</a>. The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters: <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">the Duke of Buckingham</a>, <a href="William%20Laud">Archbishop William Laud</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford">the Earl of Strafford</a>. James insisted that the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a> be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons' walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales. Charles, like his father, considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father's <a href="royal%20prerogative">royal prerogative</a>. In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members' impudence and intransigence.

Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's favourite and a man who had great influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the <a href="Penal%20law%20%28Britain%29">penal laws</a>, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the <a href="Gaspar%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%20Count-Duke%20of%20Olivares">Count of Olivares</a>, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.

With the encouragement of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 so that he could request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the <a href="Lord%20Treasurer">Lord Treasurer</a>, <a href="Lionel%20Cranfield%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Middlesex">Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex</a>, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under <a href="Ernst%20von%20Mansfeld">Ernst von Mansfeld</a> set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.

By 1624, James was growing ill, and as a result was finding it difficult to control Parliament. By the time of his death in March 1625, Charles and the Duke of Buckingham had already assumed "de facto" control of the kingdom.

With the failure of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their attention to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was <a href="married%20by%20proxy">married by proxy</a> to the fifteen-year-old French princess <a href="Henrietta%20Maria">Henrietta Maria</a> in front of the doors of the <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame de Paris</a>. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The married couple met in person on 13 June 1625 in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the marriage was consummated, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII of France</a>. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a> in September 1625. Charles was <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">crowned</a> on 2 February 1626 at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.

Distrust of Charles's religious policies increased with his support of a controversial <a href="History%20of%20Calvinist-Arminian%20debate">anti-Calvinist</a> ecclesiastic, <a href="Richard%20Montagu">Richard Montagu</a>, who was in disrepute among the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s. In his pamphlet "A New Gag for an Old Goose" (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet "A New Gag for the New Gospel", Montagu argued against <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> <a href="predestination">predestination</a>, the doctrine that <a href="salvation">salvation</a> and <a href="damnation">damnation</a> were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as <a href="Arminians">Arminians</a> – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines had been one of the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled "<a href="Richard%20Montagu%23The%20Appello">Appello Caesarem</a>", in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.

Rather than direct involvement in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>, hoping for the capture of the <a href="Spanish%20treasure%20fleet">Spanish treasure fleet</a>s. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of <a href="tonnage%20and%20poundage">tonnage and poundage</a> (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a> had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its <a href="first%20reading">first reading</a>. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.

A poorly conceived and executed <a href="Cadiz%20Expedition%20%281625%29">naval expedition against Spain</a> under the leadership of Buckingham went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke. In May 1626, Charles nominated Buckingham as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Cambridge%20University">Chancellor of Cambridge University</a> in a show of support, and had two members who had spoken against Buckingham – <a href="Dudley%20Digges">Dudley Digges</a> and <a href="John%20Eliot%20%28statesman%29">Sir John Eliot</a> – arrested at the door of the House. The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members, and after about a week in custody, both were released. On 12 June 1626, the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham, stating,
"We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from intermeddling with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given." Despite Parliament's protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.

Meanwhile, domestic quarrels between Charles and Henrietta Maria were souring the early years of their marriage. Disputes over her <a href="jointure">jointure</a>, appointments to her household, and the practice of her religion culminated in the king expelling the vast majority of her French attendants in August 1626. Despite Charles's agreement to provide the French with English ships as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria, in 1627 he launched <a href="Siege%20of%20Saint-Martin-de-R%C3%A9%20%281627%29">an attack on the French coast</a> to defend the Huguenots at La Rochelle. The action, led by Buckingham, was ultimately unsuccessful. Buckingham's failure to protect the Huguenots – and his retreat from <a href="Saint-Martin-de-R%C3%A9">Saint-Martin-de-Ré</a> – spurred Louis XIII's <a href="siege%20of%20La%20Rochelle">siege of La Rochelle</a> and furthered the English Parliament's and people's detestation of the duke.

Charles provoked further unrest by trying to raise money for the war through a "forced loan": a tax levied without parliamentary consent. In November 1627, the test case in the <a href="King%27s%20Bench">King's Bench</a>, the "<a href="Five%20Knights%27%20Case">Five Knights' Case</a>", found that the king had a prerogative right to imprison without trial those who refused to pay the forced loan. Summoned again in March 1628, on 26 May Parliament adopted a <a href="Petition%20of%20Right">Petition of Right</a>, calling upon the king to acknowledge that he could not levy taxes without Parliament's consent, not impose martial law on civilians, not imprison them without due process, and not quarter troops in their homes. Charles assented to the petition on 7 June, but by the end of the month he had prorogued Parliament and re-asserted his right to collect customs duties without authorisation from Parliament.

On 23 August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated. Charles was deeply distressed. According to <a href="Edward%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon</a>, he "threw himself upon his bed, lamenting with much passion and with abundance of tears". He remained grieving in his room for two days. In contrast, the public rejoiced at Buckingham's death, which accentuated the gulf between the court and the nation, and between the Crown and the Commons. Although the death of Buckingham effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue, it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament. It did, however, coincide with an improvement in Charles's relationship with his wife, and by November 1628 their old quarrels were at an end. Perhaps Charles's emotional ties were transferred from Buckingham to Henrietta Maria. She became pregnant for the first time, and the bond between them grew stronger. Together, they embodied an image of virtue and family life, and their court became a model of formality and morality.

In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been <a href="prorogued">prorogued</a> in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of <a href="John%20Rolle%20%28Parliamentarian%29">John Rolle</a>, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, <a href="John%20Finch%2C%201st%20Baron%20Finch">Sir John Finch</a>, down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.

Shortly after the prorogation, without the means in the foreseeable future to raise funds from Parliament for a European war, or the influence of Buckingham, Charles made <a href="Treaty%20of%20Suza">peace with France</a> and Spain. The following eleven years, during which Charles ruled England without a Parliament, are referred to as the <a href="Personal%20rule%20of%20Charles%20I%20%281629%E2%80%931640%29">personal rule</a> or the "eleven years' tyranny". Ruling without Parliament was not exceptional, and was supported by precedent. Only Parliament, however, could legally raise taxes, and without it Charles's capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was limited to his customary rights and prerogatives.

A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckingham's short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister, Elizabeth, and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the "Distraint of Knighthood", in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king's coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626.

The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as <a href="ship%20money">ship money</a>, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than tonnage and poundage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king's prerogative, though some of them had reservations. The prosecution of <a href="John%20Hampden">John Hampden</a> for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges found against Hampden only by the narrow margin of 7–5.

The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies, despite a <a href="Statute%20of%20Monopolies">statute forbidding such action</a>, which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s. One such monopoly was for soap, pejoratively referred to as "<a href="popish%20soap">popish soap</a>" because some of its backers were Catholics. Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation (1625), whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent. In addition, the boundaries of the <a href="royal%20forest">royal forest</a>s in England were restored to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the reasserted boundaries for encroachment. The focus of the programme was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for conversion to pasture and arable farming, or in the case of the <a href="Forest%20of%20Dean">Forest of Dean</a>, development for the iron industry. Disafforestation frequently caused riots and disturbances including those known as the <a href="Western%20Rising%20and%20disafforestation%20riots">Western Rising</a>.

Against the background of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the <a href="Royal%20Mint">mint</a> in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> refused to grant a loan, <a href="Lord%20Cottington">Lord Cottington</a> seized the company's stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.

Throughout Charles's reign, the issue of how far the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> should progress was constantly in the forefront of political debate. <a href="Arminianism">Arminian</a> theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, which opponents viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism. <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> reformers thought Charles was too sympathetic to the teachings of Arminianism, which they considered irreligious, and opposed his desire to move the Church of England in a more traditional and sacramental direction. In addition, his Protestant subjects followed the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.

In 1633, Charles appointed <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a> <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. They initiated a series of reforms aimed at ensuring religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> be celebrated as prescribed by the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>, organising the internal architecture of English churches to emphasise the sacrament of the altar, and re-issuing King James's <a href="Declaration%20of%20Sports">Declaration of Sports</a>, which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. The <a href="Feoffees%20for%20Impropriations">Feoffees for Impropriations</a>, an organisation that bought <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s and <a href="advowson">advowson</a>s so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. Laud prosecuted those who opposed his reforms in the <a href="Court%20of%20High%20Commission">Court of High Commission</a> and the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a>, the two most powerful courts in the land. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views and unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. For example, in 1637 <a href="William%20Prynne">William Prynne</a>, <a href="Henry%20Burton%20%28Puritan%29">Henry Burton</a> and <a href="John%20Bastwick">John Bastwick</a> were <a href="pillory">pilloried</a>, whipped and mutilated by <a href="Cropping%20%28punishment%29">cropping</a> and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets.

When Charles attempted to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; his first visit since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted using the <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> rite. In 1637, the king ordered the use of a new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the <a href="Kirk">Kirk</a>. Although it had been written, under Charles's direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, <a href="Jenny%20Geddes">riots</a> erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book's usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the <a href="National%20Covenant">National Covenant</a>, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. When the <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Scotland">General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</a> met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished <a href="Episcopal%20polity">episcopal church government</a> by bishops, and adopted <a href="Presbyterian%20polity">presbyterian</a> government by elders and deacons.

Charles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the <a href="Bishops%27%20Wars">First Bishops' War</a> in 1639. Charles did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, on the border of Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the <a href="Covenanter">Covenanter</a>s as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berwick%20%281639%29">Treaty of Berwick</a>, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.

The military failure in the First Bishops' War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain, while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives, led to the public humiliation of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Downs">Battle of the Downs</a>, where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet off the coast of Kent in sight of the impotent English navy.

Charles continued peace negotiations with the Scots in a bid to gain time before launching a new military campaign. Because of his financial weakness, he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture. Both English and <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Irish parliaments</a> were summoned in the early months of 1640. In March 1640, the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May. In the English general election in March, however, court candidates fared badly, and Charles's dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate. The earls of <a href="Algernon%20Percy%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Northumberland</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford">Strafford</a> attempted to broker a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £650,000 (although the cost of the coming war was estimated at around £1 million). Nevertheless, this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons. The Parliamentarians' calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still retained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of Northumberland, the <a href="Short%20Parliament">Short Parliament</a> (as it came to be known) was dissolved in May 1640, less than a month after it assembled.

By this stage Strafford, <a href="Lord%20Deputy%20of%20Ireland">Lord Deputy of Ireland</a> since 1632, had emerged as Charles's right-hand man and together with Laud, pursued a policy of "<a href="Thorough">Thorough</a>" that aimed to make central royal authority more efficient and effective at the expense of local or anti-government interests. Although originally a critic of the king, Strafford defected to royal service in 1628 (due in part to Buckingham's persuasion), and had since emerged, alongside Laud, as the most influential of Charles's ministers.

Bolstered by the failure of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament declared itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, where they defeated the English forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Newburn">Battle of Newburn</a> and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of <a href="County%20Durham">Durham</a>.

As demands for a parliament grew, Charles took the unusual step of summoning a <a href="great%20council%20of%20peers">great council of peers</a>. By the time it met, on 24 September at <a href="York">York</a>, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ripon">Treaty of Ripon</a>, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the <a href="Long%20Parliament">Long Parliament</a>. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.

The Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now <a href="Lord%20Keeper%20of%20the%20Great%20Seal">Lord Keeper of the Great Seal</a>, was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to <a href="the%20Hague">the Hague</a> with Charles's permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the <a href="Triennial%20Act">Triennial Act</a>, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> in February 1641.

Strafford had become the principal target of the Parliamentarians, particularly <a href="John%20Pym">John Pym</a>, and he went on trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. However, the key allegation by <a href="Henry%20Vane%20the%20Elder">Sir Henry Vane</a> that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.

Charles assured Strafford that "upon the word of a king you shall not suffer in life, honour or fortune", and the attainder could not succeed if Charles withheld assent. Furthermore, many members and most peers were opposed to the attainder, not wishing, in the words of one, to "commit murder with the sword of justice". However, increased tensions and an attempted coup by royalist army officers in support of Strafford and in which Charles was involved began to sway the issue. The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a large margin (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 230 abstained), and the Lords acquiesced (by 26 votes to 19, with 79 absent) in May. On 3 May, Parliament's <a href="Protestation%20of%201641">Protestation</a> attacked the "wicked counsels" of Charles's "arbitrary and tyrannical government"; while those who signed the petition undertook to defend the king's "person, honour and estate", they also swore to preserve "the true reformed religion", parliament, and the "rights and liberties of the subjects". Charles, fearing for the safety of his family in the face of unrest, assented reluctantly to Strafford's attainder on 9 May after consulting his judges and bishops. Strafford was beheaded three days later.

Additionally in early May, Charles assented to an unprecedented Act that forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.

Charles had made important concessions in England, and temporarily improved his position in Scotland by securing the favour of the Scots on a visit from August to November 1641 during which he conceded to the official establishment of presbyterianism. However, following an attempted royalist coup in Scotland, known as "<a href="The%20Incident%20%28conspiracy%29">The Incident</a>", Charles's credibility was significantly undermined.

In Ireland, the population was split into three main socio-political groups: the <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic Irish</a>, who were Catholic; the <a href="Old%20English%20%28Ireland%29">Old English</a>, who were descended from <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland">medieval Normans</a> and were also predominantly Catholic; and the <a href="Plantations%20of%20Ireland">New English</a>, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.

Strafford's fall from power weakened Charles's influence in Ireland. The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army at the end of Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the <a href="plantation%20of%20Ulster">plantation of Ulster</a>, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.

In November 1641, the House of Commons passed the <a href="Grand%20Remonstrance">Grand Remonstrance</a>, a long list of grievances against actions by Charles's ministers committed since the beginning of his reign (that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy of which the king was an unwitting member), but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes – 159 to 148. Furthermore, the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords, which the Remonstrance attacked. The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion, coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charles's complicity. Throughout November, a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland, which included massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords. Rumours of "papist" conspiracies circulated in England, and English anti-Catholic opinion was strengthened, damaging Charles's reputation and authority.
The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons suspected that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym's <a href="Militia%20Bill">Militia Bill</a> was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The <a href="Militia%20Ordinance">Militia Ordinance</a> appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into lawlessness, when he placed the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> under the command of Colonel <a href="Thomas%20Lunsford">Thomas Lunsford</a>, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.

Charles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up <a href="five%20members">five members</a> of the Commons – Pym, <a href="John%20Hampden">John Hampden</a>, <a href="Denzil%20Holles%2C%201st%20Baron%20Holles">Denzil Holles</a>, <a href="William%20Strode">William Strode</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Haselrig">Sir Arthur Haselrig</a> – and one peer – <a href="Edward%20Montagu%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Manchester">Lord Mandeville</a> – on the grounds of high treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally. However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January. Having displaced the Speaker, <a href="William%20Lenthall">William Lenthall</a>, from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, famously replied, "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here." Charles abjectly declared "all my birds have flown", and was forced to retire, empty-handed.

The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.

Parliament quickly seized London, and Charles fled the capital for <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a> on 10 January, moving two days later to <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. After sending his wife and eldest daughter to safety abroad in February, he travelled northwards, hoping to seize the military arsenal at <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. To his dismay, he was <a href="Siege%20of%20Hull%20%281642%29">rebuffed by the town's Parliamentary governor</a>, <a href="Sir%20John%20Hotham%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Hotham</a>, who refused him entry in April, and Charles was forced to withdraw.

In mid-1642, both sides began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method of <a href="commission%20of%20array">commission of array</a>, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal standard in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> on 22 August 1642. At the start of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>, Charles's forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.

After a few skirmishes, the opposing forces met in earnest at <a href="Battle%20of%20Edgehill">Edgehill</a>, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew <a href="Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine">Prince Rupert of the Rhine</a> disagreed with the battle strategy of the royalist commander <a href="Robert%20Bertie%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lindsey">Lord Lindsey</a>, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by <a href="Patrick%20Ruthven%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Forth">Lord Forth</a>. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.

In his own words, the experience of battle had left Charles "exceedingly and deeply grieved". He regrouped at Oxford, turning down Rupert's suggestion of an immediate attack on London. After a week, he set out for the capital on 3 November, <a href="Battle%20of%20Brentford%20%281642%29">capturing Brentford</a> on the way while simultaneously continuing to negotiate with civic and parliamentary delegations. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Turnham%20Green">Turnham Green</a> on the outskirts of London, the royalist army met resistance from the city militia, and faced with a numerically superior force, Charles ordered a retreat. He overwintered in Oxford, strengthening the city's defences and preparing for the next season's campaign. <a href="Treaty%20of%20Oxford">Peace talks</a> between the two sides collapsed in April.

The war continued indecisively over the next couple of years, and Henrietta Maria returned to Britain for 17 months from February 1643. After Rupert <a href="Storming%20of%20Bristol">captured Bristol</a> in July 1643, Charles visited the port city and laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Gloucester">siege to Gloucester</a>, further up the <a href="river%20Severn">river Severn</a>. His plan to undermine the city walls failed due to heavy rain, and on the approach of a parliamentary relief force, Charles lifted the siege and withdrew to <a href="Sudeley%20Castle">Sudeley Castle</a>. The parliamentary army turned back towards London, and Charles set off in pursuit. The two armies met at <a href="Newbury%2C%20Berkshire">Newbury, Berkshire</a>, on 20 September. Just as at Edgehill, the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Newbury">battle</a> stalemated at nightfall, and the armies disengaged. In January 1644, Charles summoned a Parliament at Oxford, which was attended by about 40 peers and 118 members of the Commons; all told, the <a href="Oxford%20Parliament%20%281644%29">Oxford Parliament</a>, which sat until March 1645, was supported by the majority of peers and about a third of the Commons. Charles became disillusioned by the assembly's ineffectiveness, calling it a "mongrel" in private letters to his wife.

In 1644, Charles remained in the southern half of England while Rupert rode north to <a href="Relief%20of%20Newark">relieve Newark</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20York">York</a>, which were under threat from parliamentary and Scottish Covenanter armies. Charles was victorious at the <a href="battle%20of%20Cropredy%20Bridge">battle of Cropredy Bridge</a> in late June, but the royalists in the north were defeated at the <a href="battle%20of%20Marston%20Moor">battle of Marston Moor</a> just a few days later. The king continued his <a href="Battle%20of%20Lostwithiel">campaign in the south</a>, encircling and disarming the parliamentary army of the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>. Returning northwards to his base at Oxford, he fought at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Newbury">Newbury for a second time</a> before the winter closed in; the battle ended indecisively. Attempts to negotiate a settlement over the winter, while both sides re-armed and re-organised, were again unsuccessful.

At the <a href="battle%20of%20Naseby">battle of Naseby</a> on 14 June 1645, Rupert's horsemen again mounted a successful charge against the flank of Parliament's <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a>, but Charles's troops elsewhere on the field were pushed back by the opposing forces. Charles, attempting to rally his men, rode forward but as he did so, <a href="Robert%20Dalzell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Carnwath">Lord Carnwath</a> seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the king's safety. Carnwath's action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. The military balance tipped decisively in favour of Parliament. There followed a series of defeats for the royalists, and then the <a href="Siege%20of%20Oxford">Siege of Oxford</a>, <a href="Charles%20I%27s%20journey%20from%20Oxford%20to%20the%20Scottish%20army%20camp%20near%20Newark">from which Charles escaped</a> (disguised as a servant) in April 1646. He put himself into the hands of the Scottish presbyterian army besieging <a href="Newark%2C%20England">Newark</a>, and was taken northwards to <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. After nine months of negotiations, the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament: in exchange for £100,000, and the promise of more money in the future, the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647.

Parliament held Charles under house arrest at <a href="Holdenby%20House">Holdenby House</a> in Northamptonshire until Cornet <a href="George%20Joyce">George Joyce</a> took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army. By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by <a href="congregationalist%20polity">congregationalist</a> <a href="Independent%20%28religion%29">Independents</a>, who sought a greater political role. Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat. He was taken first to <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a>, at his own suggestion, and then transferred to <a href="Oatlands%20Palace">Oatlands</a> and subsequently <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court</a>, while more <a href="Heads%20of%20Proposals">ultimately fruitless negotiations</a> took place. By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape – perhaps to France, Southern England or to <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, near the Scottish border. He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of <a href="Southampton%20Water">Southampton Water</a> made contact with Colonel <a href="Robert%20Hammond%20%28English%20army%20officer%29">Robert Hammond</a>, Parliamentary Governor of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic. Hammond, however, confined Charles in <a href="Carisbrooke%20Castle">Carisbrooke Castle</a> and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody.

From Carisbrooke, Charles continued to try to bargain with the various parties. In direct contrast to his previous conflict with the Scottish Kirk, on 26 December 1647 he signed a secret treaty with the Scots. Under the agreement, called the "<a href="Engagers">Engagement</a>", the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles's behalf and restore him to the throne on condition that presbyterianism be established in England for three years.

The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the <a href="Second%20English%20Civil%20War">Second Civil War</a>, and as agreed with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, and <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, and a rebellion in South Wales, were put down by the New Model Army, and with the defeat of the Scots at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Preston%20%281648%29">Battle of Preston</a> in August 1648, the royalists lost any chance of winning the war.

Charles's only recourse was to return to negotiations, which were held at <a href="Newport%2C%20Isle%20of%20Wight">Newport</a> on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed in the custody of the army the following day. In <a href="Pride%27s%20Purge">Pride's Purge</a> on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel <a href="Thomas%20Pride">Thomas Pride</a>, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the <a href="Rump%20Parliament">Rump Parliament</a>. It was effectively a military coup.

Charles was moved to <a href="Hurst%20Castle">Hurst Castle</a> at the end of 1648, and thereafter to <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. In January 1649, the Rump House of Commons indicted him on a charge of treason, which was rejected by the House of Lords. The idea of trying a king was a novel one. The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England – <a href="Henry%20Rolle">Henry Rolle</a>, <a href="Oliver%20St%20John">Oliver St John</a> and <a href="John%20Wilde%20%28jurist%29">John Wilde</a> – all opposed the indictment as unlawful. The Rump Commons declared itself capable of legislating alone, passed a bill creating a separate court for Charles's trial, and declared the bill an act without the need for royal assent. The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 commissioners, but many either refused to serve or chose to stay away. Only 68 (all firm Parliamentarians) attended Charles's trial on charges of high treason and "other high crimes" that began on 20 January 1649 in <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster%23Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>. <a href="John%20Bradshaw%20%28judge%29">John Bradshaw</a> acted as President of the Court, and the <a href="prosecutor">prosecution</a> was led by the <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor General</a>, <a href="John%20Cook%20%28regicide%29">John Cook</a>.

Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of the country. The charge stated that he, "for accomplishment of such his designs, and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices, to the same ends hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented", and that the "wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the said Charles Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation." Reflecting the modern concept of <a href="command%20responsibility">command responsibility</a>, the indictment held him "guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby." An estimated 300,000 people, or 6% of the population, died during the war.

Over the first three days of the trial, whenever Charles was asked to plead, he refused, stating his objection with the words: "I would know by what power I am called hither, by what lawful authority...?" He claimed that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch, that his own authority to rule had been <a href="Divine%20right%20of%20kings">given to him by God</a> and by the traditional laws of England, and that the power wielded by those trying him was only that of force of arms. Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining that, The court, by contrast, challenged the doctrine of <a href="sovereign%20immunity">sovereign immunity</a> and proposed that "the King of England was not a person, but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern 'by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise'."

At the end of the third day, Charles was removed from the court, which then heard over 30 witnesses against the king in his absence over the next two days, and on 26 January condemned him to death. The following day, the king was brought before a public session of the commission, declared guilty, and sentenced. <a href="List%20of%20regicides%20of%20Charles%20I">Fifty-nine of the commissioners</a> signed Charles's death warrant.

Charles's <a href="beheading">beheading</a> was scheduled for Tuesday, 30 January 1649. Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians: <a href="Elizabeth%20Stuart%20%281635%E2%80%931650%29">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="Henry%20Stuart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Henry</a>. They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: "the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear. I would have no such imputation."

He walked under guard from <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, where he had been confined, to the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the <a href="Banqueting%20House%2C%20Whitehall">Banqueting House</a>. Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: "An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, "but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government ... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things." He continued, "I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be."

At about 2:00 p.m., Charles put his head on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by stretching out his hands; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke. According to observer <a href="Philip%20Henry%20%28clergyman%29">Philip Henry</a>, a moan "as I never heard before and desire I may never hear again" rose from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the king's blood as a memento.

The executioner was masked and disguised, and there is debate over his identity. The commissioners approached <a href="Richard%20Brandon">Richard Brandon</a>, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but there are others who have been named as potential candidates, including <a href="George%20Joyce">George Joyce</a>, <a href="William%20Hewlett%20%28regicide%29">William Hulet</a> and <a href="Hugh%20Peters">Hugh Peters</a>. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.

It was common practice for the severed head of a traitor to be held up and exhibited to the crowd with the words "Behold the head of a traitor!" Although Charles's head was exhibited, the words were not used, possibly because the executioner did not want his voice recognised. On the day after the execution, the king's head was sewn back onto his body, which was then embalmed and placed in a lead coffin.

The commission refused to allow Charles's burial at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, so his body was conveyed to Windsor on the night of 7 February. He was buried in private in the Henry VIII vault alongside the coffins of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> and Henry's third wife, <a href="Jane%20Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>, in <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>, on 9 February 1649. The king's son, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park, London</a>, but it was never built.

Ten days after Charles's execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purporting to be written by the king appeared for sale. This book, the "<a href="Eikon%20Basilike">Eikon Basilike</a>" (Greek for the "Royal Portrait"), contained an "apologia" for royal policies, and it proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda. <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the "<a href="Eikonoklastes">Eikonoklastes</a>" ("The Iconoclast"), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book. Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom, and in the <a href="Convocations%20of%20Canterbury%20and%20York">Convocations of Canterbury and York</a> of 1660 <a href="King%20Charles%20the%20Martyr">King Charles the Martyr</a> was added to the <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Church%20of%20England%29">Church of England's liturgical calendar</a>. <a href="High%20church">High church</a> Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death. Churches, such as those at <a href="Church%20of%20King%20Charles%20the%20Martyr%2C%20Falmouth">Falmouth</a> and <a href="Church%20of%20King%20Charles%20the%20Martyr%2C%20Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, and Anglican devotional societies such as the <a href="Society%20of%20King%20Charles%20the%20Martyr">Society of King Charles the Martyr</a>, were founded in his honour.

With the monarchy overthrown, England became a republic or "<a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a>". The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons, and executive power was assumed by a <a href="English%20Council%20of%20State">Council of State</a>. All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> in the <a href="Third%20English%20Civil%20War">Third English Civil War</a> and the <a href="Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland">Cromwellian conquest of Ireland</a>. Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653, thereby establishing <a href="the%20Protectorate">the Protectorate</a> with himself as <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a>. Upon his death in 1658, he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son, <a href="Richard%20Cromwell">Richard</a>. Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was <a href="English%20Restoration">restored</a> to Charles I's eldest son, Charles II, in 1660.

Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he sat for a sketch by <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a>, and acquired works by <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Antonio%20da%20Correggio">Correggio</a>, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the <a href="Banqueting%20House%2C%20Whitehall">Banqueting House, Whitehall</a>, by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a> and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as <a href="Gerard%20van%20Honthorst">van Honthorst</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Mytens">Mytens</a>, and <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">van Dyck</a>. His close associates, including the <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Duke of Buckingham</a> and the <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%2021st%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a>, shared his interest and have been dubbed the <a href="Whitehall%20Group">Whitehall Group</a>. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Mantua">Duke of Mantua</a>, which included work by Titian, Correggio, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>, <a href="Andrea%20del%20Sarto">del Sarto</a> and <a href="Andrea%20Mantegna">Mantegna</a>. His collection grew further to encompass <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Bernini</a>, <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Bruegel</a>, <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">da Vinci</a>, <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a>, <a href="Wenceslaus%20Hollar">Hollar</a>, <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a> and <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Veronese</a>, and self-portraits by both <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Dürer</a> and <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.

In the words of <a href="John%20Philipps%20Kenyon">John Philipps Kenyon</a>, "Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy". Revered by <a href="high%20Tories">high Tories</a> who considered him a saintly martyr, he was condemned by <a href="Whig%20history">Whig historians</a>, such as <a href="Samuel%20Rawson%20Gardiner">Samuel Rawson Gardiner</a>, who thought him duplicitous and delusional. In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, the main exception being <a href="Kevin%20Sharpe%20%28historian%29">Kevin Sharpe</a> who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles that has not been widely adopted. While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, Professor <a href="Barry%20Coward">Barry Coward</a> thought Charles "was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI", a view shared by <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a>, who called him "the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages".

Archbishop <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, who was beheaded by Parliament during the war, described Charles as "A mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be, or how to be made, great." Charles was more sober and refined than his father, but he was intransigent. He deliberately pursued unpopular policies that ultimately brought ruin on himself. Both Charles and James were advocates of the <a href="divine%20right%20of%20kings">divine right of kings</a>, but while James's ambitions concerning <a href="Absolutism%20%28European%20history%29">absolute prerogative</a> were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles believed that he had no need to compromise or even to explain his actions. He thought he was answerable only to God. "Princes are not bound to give account of their actions," he wrote, "but to God alone".


The official <a href="style%20%28manner%20of%20address%29">style</a> of Charles I as king in England was "Charles, by the Grace of God, <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">Scotland</a>, <a href="British%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne">France</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Defender%20of%20the%20Faith">Defender of the Faith</a>, etc." The style "of France" was only nominal, and was used by every English monarch from <a href="Edward%20III">Edward III</a> to <a href="George%20III">George III</a>, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled. The authors of his death warrant referred to him as "Charles Stuart, King of England".

Dungeons &amp; Dragons

Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D) is a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> <a href="tabletop%20role-playing%20game">tabletop role-playing game</a> (RPG) originally designed by <a href="Gary%20Gygax">Gary Gygax</a> and <a href="Dave%20Arneson">Dave Arneson</a>. It was first published in 1974 by <a href="TSR%20%28company%29%23Tactical%20Studies%20Rules">Tactical Studies Rules, Inc.</a> (TSR). The game has been published by <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a> (now a subsidiary of <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a>) since 1997. It was derived from <a href="miniature%20wargaming">miniature wargames</a>, with a variation of the 1971 game <a href="chainmail%20%28game%29">"Chainmail"</a> serving as the initial rule system. "D&D" publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.

"D&D" departs from traditional <a href="wargaming">wargaming</a> by allowing each player to create their own <a href="Player%20character">character</a> to play instead of a <a href="military%20formation">military formation</a>. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A <a href="Dungeon%20Master">Dungeon Master</a> (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.

The early success of "D&D" led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite the competition, "D&D" has remained as the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Basic%20Set%20and%20revisions">basic "Dungeons & Dragons"</a>, and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of "<a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</a>" (abbreviated as "AD&D"). "AD&D" 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as "D&D" 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from "AD&D"; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the <a href="D20%20system">d20 System</a>, which is available under the <a href="Open%20Game%20License">Open Game License</a> (OGL) for use by other publishers. "D&D" 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of "D&D", the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.

, "D&D" remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game, and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales. The game has been supplemented by many pre-made <a href="Adventure%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">adventures</a>, as well as commercial <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20campaign%20settings">campaign settings</a> suitable for use by regular gaming groups. "D&D" is known beyond the game itself for other <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons-related%20products">"D&D"-branded products</a>, <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20in%20popular%20culture">references in popular culture</a>, and some of the <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20controversies">controversies</a> that have surrounded it, particularly a <a href="moral%20panic">moral panic</a> in the 1980s falsely linking it to <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a> and <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.

"Dungeons & Dragons" is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, each player controls only a single character, which represents an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, these <a href="player%20characters">player characters</a> (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single <a href="Adventure%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">adventure</a>, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a "<a href="campaign%20%28role-playing%20games%29">campaign</a>".

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the <a href="Dungeon%20Master">Dungeon Master</a> (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes the various <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with "<a href="monster">monster</a>s" – a generic term used in "D&D" to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. The game's extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, <a href="Magic%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">magic use</a>, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.

The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20manuals">core rulebooks</a>: The "<a href="Player%27s%20Handbook">Player's Handbook</a>", the "<a href="Dungeon%20Master%27s%20Guide">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>" and the "<a href="Monster%20Manual">Monster Manual</a>".

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a <a href="character%20sheet">character sheet</a> for each player, and a number of <a href="polyhedral%20dice">polyhedral dice</a>. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20campaign%20settings">campaign settings</a>.

Before the game begins, each player <a href="character%20creation">creates</a> their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's <a href="Game%20mechanics%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29%23Ability%20scores">ability scores</a>, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a <a href="Character%20race%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">race</a> (species) such as human or elf, a <a href="Character%20class%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">character class</a> (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an <a href="Alignment%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">alignment</a> (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.

During the game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a <a href="saving%20throw">saving throw</a> can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.

As the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain <a href="Character%20class%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29%23Multi-classing">additional character classes</a>. The key way characters progress is by earning <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a <a href="Experience%20level">level</a>, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.

<a href="Hit%20point">Hit point</a>s (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.

A typical "Dungeons & Dragons" game consists of an "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story. The DM can either design an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as "modules") that have been published throughout the history of "Dungeons & Dragons". Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled "<a href="Temple%20of%20the%20Frog">Temple of the Frog</a>" was included in the "<a href="Blackmoor%20%28supplement%29">Blackmoor</a>" rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone "D&D" module published by TSR was 1978's "<a href="Steading%20of%20the%20Hill%20Giant%20Chief">Steading of the Hill Giant Chief</a>", written by Gygax.

A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a "<a href="campaign%20%28role-playing%20games%29">campaign</a>". The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire <a href="fictional%20universe">fictional universe</a>, are referred to as "<a href="campaign%20setting">campaign setting</a>s" or "world". "D&D" settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20campaign%20settings">campaign settings for "Dungeons & Dragons"</a> include <a href="Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a>, <a href="Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a>, <a href="Forgotten%20Realms">Forgotten Realms</a>, <a href="Mystara">Mystara</a>, <a href="Spelljammer">Spelljammer</a>, <a href="Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a>, <a href="Dark%20Sun">Dark Sun</a>, <a href="Planescape">Planescape</a>, <a href="Birthright%20%28campaign%20setting%29">Birthright</a>, and <a href="Eberron">Eberron</a>. Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.

The <a href="wargaming">wargames</a> from which "Dungeons & Dragons" evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. "D&D" initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original "D&D" set of 1974 required the use of the "<a href="Chainmail%20%28game%29">Chainmail</a>" miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.

In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for "Dungeons & Dragons" and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include <a href="Grenadier%20Miniatures">Grenadier Miniatures</a> (1980–1983), <a href="Citadel%20Miniatures">Citadel Miniatures</a> (1984–1986), <a href="Ral%20Partha">Ral Partha</a>, and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25 mm scale.

Periodically, "Dungeons & Dragons" has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as "<a href="Battlesystem">Battlesystem</a>" (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of "Chainmail" (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.

An immediate predecessor of "Dungeons & Dragons" was a set of medieval miniature rules written by <a href="Jeff%20Perren">Jeff Perren</a>. These were expanded by <a href="Gary%20Gygax">Gary Gygax</a>, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as "<a href="Chainmail%20%28game%29">Chainmail</a>". When <a href="Dave%20Wesely">Dave Wesely</a> entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer <a href="Dave%20Arneson">Dave Arneson</a> began a medieval variation of Wesely's <a href="Braunstein%20%28wargame%29">Braunstein</a> games, where players control individuals instead of armies. Arneson used "Chainmail" to resolve combat. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others. Having partnered previously with Gygax on "<a href="Don%27t%20Give%20Up%20the%20Ship%21">Don't Give Up the Ship!</a>", Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing "The Fantasy Game", the role-playing game (RPG) that became "Dungeons & Dragons", with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax. The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy — upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, "Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons and Dragons best!", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.

Many "Dungeons & Dragons" elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in <a href="improvisational%20theatre">improvisational theatre</a>. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in <a href="Glorantha">Glorantha</a>'s board games among others. Ultimately, however, "Dungeons & Dragons" represents a unique blending of these elements.

The world of "D&D" was influenced by world mythology, history, <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a>, and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and "<a href="The%20Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>" as an influence on "D&D" is controversial. The presence in the game of <a href="Halfling%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">halflings</a>, <a href="Elf%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">elves</a>, <a href="Half-elf%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">half-elves</a>, <a href="Dwarf%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">dwarves</a>, <a href="Orc%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">orcs</a>, <a href="Ranger%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">rangers</a>, and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from <a href="Middle-earth%20Enterprises">Tolkien Enterprises</a> prompted the name changes of <a href="hobbit">hobbit</a> to 'halfling', <a href="ent">ent</a> to '<a href="treant">treant</a>', and <a href="balrog">balrog</a> to '<a href="Balor%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">balor</a>'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game. However, in an interview in 2000, he acknowledged that Tolkien's work had a "strong impact".

The "D&D" magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the "<a href="Dying%20Earth%20series">Dying Earth</a>" stories and novels of <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') was derived from the novel "<a href="Three%20Hearts%20and%20Three%20Lions">Three Hearts and Three Lions</a>" by <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>. A troll described in this work influenced the "D&D" definition of that monster.

Other influences include the works of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, <a href="A.%20Merritt">A. Merritt</a>, <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a>, <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>. Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as <a href="Van%20vogt">A. E. van Vogt's</a> "Black Destroyer", <a href="Coeurl">Coeurl</a> (the <a href="Displacer%20Beast">Displacer Beast</a>), <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>" (<a href="vorpal">vorpal</a> sword) and the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a> (the clerical spell 'Blade Barrier' was inspired by the "<a href="Flaming%20sword%20%28mythology%29">flaming sword</a> which turned every way" at the gates of <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Eden</a>).

"Dungeons & Dragons" has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.

The <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%281974%29">original "Dungeons & Dragons"</a>, now referred to as "OD&D", was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original <a href="Greyhawk%20%28supplement%29">Greyhawk</a> and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s.

In early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide "D&D" for nearly two decades. A "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Basic%20Set">Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set</a>" boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" ("AD&D") was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the "Basic Set" directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.

As a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in "AD&D". <a href="John%20Eric%20Holmes">John Eric Holmes</a>, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. "AD&D", on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the "core rulebooks", were released: the "<a href="Player%27s%20Handbook">Player's Handbook</a>" (PHB), the "<a href="Dungeon%20Master%27s%20Guide">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>" (DMG), and the "<a href="Monster%20Manual">Monster Manual</a>" (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably "<a href="Unearthed%20Arcana">Unearthed Arcana</a>" (1985) that included a large number of new rules. Confusing matters further, the original "D&D" boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.

In the 1980s, the rules for "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" and "basic" "Dungeons & Dragons" remained separate, each developing along different paths.

In 1981, the basic version of "Dungeons & Dragons" was revised by <a href="Tom%20Moldvay">Tom Moldvay</a> to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original "D&D" tone, whereas "AD&D" was promoted as advancement of the mechanics. An accompanying "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Expert%20Set">Expert Set</a>", originally written by <a href="David%20Cook%20%28game%20designer%29">David "Zeb" Cook</a>, allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by <a href="Frank%20Mentzer">Frank Mentzer</a> were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Companion%20Set">Companion</a>" (1983), "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Master%20Rules">Master</a>" (1985), and "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Immortals%20Rules">Immortals</a>" (1986) sets. Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous. The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Rules%20Cyclopedia">Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia</a>", which was released alongside a new <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20Game%20%281991%20boxed%20set%29">introductory boxed set</a>.

"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition" was published in 1989, again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David "Zeb" Cook. The "Monster Manual" was replaced by the "<a href="Monstrous%20Compendium">Monstrous Compendium</a>", a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover "<a href="Monstrous%20Manual">Monstrous Manual</a>" in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition, and a series of "Player's Option" manuals were released as optional rulebooks.

The release of "AD&D 2nd Edition" deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types – such as assassins and half-orcs – were removed. The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s "sword and sorcery" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology. The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies – skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres. A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.

In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>. Following three years of development, "Dungeons & Dragons" 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the "D&D" rules to date, and served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the <a href="d20%20System">d20 System</a>. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, "Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5" was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.

In early 2005, Wizards of the Coast's R&D team started to develop "Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition", prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the "D&D" playing community and a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the 3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May 2005 until its release. "Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition" was announced at <a href="Gen%20Con">Gen Con</a> in August 2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6, 2008. 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were restructured into "Powers". These altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of options. Software tools, including player character and monster building programs, became a major part of the game.

On January 9, 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a 5th edition of the game. The company planned to take suggestions from players and let them <a href="playtest">playtest</a> the rules. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012. At Gen Con 2012 in August, <a href="Mike%20Mearls">Mike Mearls</a>, lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, "I can't emphasize this enough ... we're very serious about taking the time we need to get this right." The release of the 5th Edition, coinciding with "D&D"s 40th anniversary, occurred in the second half of 2014.

The game had more than three million players around the world by 1981, and copies of the rules were selling at a rate of about 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a <a href="French%20language">French language</a> edition in 1982, "Dungeons & Dragons" has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 2004, consumers had spent more than US$1 billion on "Dungeons & Dragons" products and the game had been played by more than 20 million people. As many as six million people played the game in 2007.

The various editions of "Dungeons & Dragons" have won many <a href="Origins%20Award">Origins Award</a>s, including "All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977", "Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989", and "Best Roleplaying Game of 2000" for the three flagship editions of the game. Both "Dungeons & Dragons" and "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions. The independent "<a href="Games%20%28magazine%29">Games</a>" magazine placed "Dungeons & Dragons" on their "Games 100" list from 1980 through 1983, then entered the game into the magazine's Hall of Fame in 1984. "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" was ranked 2nd in the 1996 reader poll of "Arcane" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.

<a href="Eric%20Goldberg%20%28game%20designer%29">Eric Goldberg</a> reviewed "Dungeons & Dragons" in "<a href="Ares%20%28magazine%29">Ares Magazine</a>" #1, rating it a 6 out of 9. Goldberg commented that ""Dungeons and Dragons" is an impressive achievement based on the concept alone, and also must be credited with cementing the marriage between the fantasy genre and gaming."

"Dungeons & Dragons" was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a <a href="game%20mechanic">game mechanic</a>, character record sheets, use of <a href="Statistic%20%28role-playing%20games%29">numerical attributes</a> and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of "Dungeons & Dragons"'s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by "D&D" include "<a href="Tunnels%20%26amp%3B%20Trolls">Tunnels & Trolls</a>" (1975), "<a href="Empire%20of%20the%20Petal%20Throne">Empire of the Petal Throne</a>" (1975), and "<a href="Chivalry%20%26amp%3B%20Sorcery">Chivalry & Sorcery</a>" (1976).

The role-playing movement initiated by "D&D" would lead to release of the science fiction game "<a href="Traveller%20%28roleplaying%20game%29">Traveller</a>" (1977), the fantasy game "<a href="RuneQuest">RuneQuest</a>" (1978), and subsequent game systems such as <a href="Chaosium">Chaosium</a>'s "<a href="Call%20of%20Cthulhu%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Call of Cthulhu</a>" (1981), "<a href="Champions%20%28roleplaying%20game%29">Champions</a>" (1982), "<a href="GURPS">GURPS</a>" (1986), and "" (1991). "Dungeons & Dragons" and the games it influenced fed back into the genre's origin – miniatures wargames – with combat strategy games like "<a href="Warhammer%20Fantasy%20Battles">Warhammer Fantasy Battles</a>". "D&D" also had a large impact on modern <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s.

Director <a href="Jon%20Favreau">Jon Favreau</a> credits "Dungeons & Dragons" with giving him "... a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance."

Early in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers' production of "D&D" compatible material, and even licensed <a href="Judges%20Guild">Judges Guild</a> to produce "D&D" materials for several years, such as "<a href="City%20State%20of%20the%20Invincible%20Overlord">City State of the Invincible Overlord</a>." This attitude changed in the mid-1980s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.

With the launch of "Dungeons & Dragons"'s <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">3rd Edition</a>, Wizards of the Coast made the d20 System available under the <a href="Open%20Game%20License">Open Game License</a> (OGL) and <a href="D20%20System%23Trademark%20license">d20 System trademark license</a>. Under these licenses, authors were free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL and d20 Trademark License made possible new games, some based on licensed products like "<a href="Star%20Wars%20Roleplaying%20Game%20%28Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast%29">Star Wars</a>", and new versions of older games, such as "<a href="Call%20of%20Cthulhu%20%28role-playing%20game%29%23D20%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>".

With the release of the <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%204th%20edition">fourth edition</a>, Wizards of the Coast introduced its <a href="Game%20System%20License">Game System License</a>, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as <a href="Paizo%20Publishing">Paizo Publishing</a> with its "<a href="Pathfinder%20Roleplaying%20Game">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>") who previously produced materials in support of the "D&D" product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as <a href="Kenzer%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Kenzer & Company</a>, are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.

During the 2000s, there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of "D&D", known as the <a href="Old%20School%20Revival">Old School Revival</a>. Game systems based on earlier editions of "D&D". "<a href="Castles%20%26amp%3B%20Crusades">Castles & Crusades</a>" (2004), by <a href="Troll%20Lord%20Games">Troll Lord Games</a>, is a reimagining of early editions by streamlining rules from OGL. This in turn inspired the creation of <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20retro-clones">"retro-clones"</a>, games which more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.

Alongside the publication of the fifth edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the fifth edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons & Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild. The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.

At various times in its history, "Dungeons & Dragons" has received negative publicity, in particular from some <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as <a href="Satanism%23Theistic%20Satanism">devil worship</a>, <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original "AD&D" manuals (mainly monsters such as <a href="Harpy%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">harpies</a>, <a href="Succubus%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">succubi</a>, etc.). These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of "AD&D". Many of these references, including the use of the names "<a href="Devil%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">devils</a>" and "<a href="Demon%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">demons</a>", were reintroduced in the 3rd edition. The <a href="moral%20panic">moral panic</a> over the game led to problems for fans of "D&D" who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>, regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs.

"Dungeons & Dragons" has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to <a href="psychotic">psychotic</a> episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of <a href="James%20Dallas%20Egbert%20III">James Dallas Egbert III</a>, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel "<a href="Mazes%20and%20Monsters%20%28novel%29">Mazes and Monsters</a>" and later made into a <a href="Mazes%20and%20Monsters">TV movie</a> in 1982 starring <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>. The game was blamed for some of the actions of <a href="Chris%20Pritchard">Chris Pritchard</a>, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, starting with Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of "D&D".

The game's commercial success was a factor that led to <a href="lawsuits">lawsuits</a> regarding distribution of <a href="royalties">royalties</a> between original creators Gygax and Arneson. Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax's decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.

"Dungeons & Dragons" has, however, been cited as encouraging people to socialize weekly or biweekly, teaching problem solving skills which can be beneficial in adult life, and teaching positive moral decisions.

"D&D"'s commercial success has led to many other related products, including <a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">"Dragon" Magazine</a>, <a href="Dungeon%20%28magazine%29">"Dungeon" Magazine</a>, an <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%28TV%20series%29">animated television series</a>, a <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%28film%29">film series</a>, an <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%28album%29">official role-playing soundtrack</a>, <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20%28novels%29">novels</a>, and numerous <a href="List%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20computer%20and%20video%20games">computer and video games</a>. Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, adventures, and other game aids related to "D&D" and its game offspring.

"D&D" grew in popularity through the late 1970s and 1980s. Numerous games, films, and cultural references based on "D&D" or "D&D"-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. "D&D" players are (sometimes pejoratively) portrayed as the epitome of <a href="geek">geek</a>dom, and have become the basis of much geek and gamer humor and satire. <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20in%20popular%20culture%23Players">Famous "D&D" players</a> include Pulitzer Prize winning author <a href="Junot%20D%C3%ADaz">Junot Díaz</a>, professional basketball player <a href="Tim%20Duncan">Tim Duncan</a>, comedian <a href="Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, and actors <a href="Vin%20Diesel">Vin Diesel</a> and <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>.

Dodo

The dodo ("Raphus cucullatus") is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a> that was <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, east of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The dodo's closest <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic relative</a> was the also-extinct <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>, the two forming the <a href="taxonomic%20rank">subfamily</a> <a href="Raphinae">Raphinae</a> of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of <a href="Columbidae">pigeons and doves</a>. The closest <a href="extant%20taxon">living</a> relative of the dodo is the <a href="Nicobar%20pigeon">Nicobar pigeon</a>. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20ibis">Réunion ibis</a> and paintings of white dodos.

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains show the dodo was about tall and may have weighed in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. As these vary considerably, and only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem. It has been depicted with brownish-grey <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used <a href="gizzard%20stone">gizzard stone</a>s to help <a href="digestion">digest</a> its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main <a href="habitat">habitat</a> is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius.

The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered it to be a mythical creature. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> swamp. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire <a href="species">species</a>. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>", and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a <a href="Bird%20extinction">symbol of extinction</a> and <a href="obsolescence">obsolescence</a>.

The dodo was variously declared a small <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>, a <a href="Rallidae">rail</a>, an <a href="albatross">albatross</a>, or a <a href="vulture">vulture</a>, by early scientists. In 1842, Danish zoologist <a href="Johannes%20Theodor%20Reinhardt">Johannes Theodor Reinhardt</a> proposed that dodos were ground <a href="columbidae">pigeons</a>, based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the collection of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Denmark">Natural History Museum of Denmark</a>. This view was met with ridicule, but was later supported by English naturalists <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Strickland">Hugh Edwin Strickland</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Gordon%20Melville">Alexander Gordon Melville</a> in their 1848 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> "The Dodo and Its Kindred", which attempted to separate myth from reality. After <a href="dissection">dissecting</a> the <a href="embalming">preserved</a> head and foot of the specimen at the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Museum">Oxford University Museum</a> and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a> ("Pezophaps solitaria") they concluded that the two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known only in pigeons.

Strickland and Melville established that the dodo was <a href="anatomy">anatomically</a> similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> portion of the <a href="beak">beak</a>, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high in relation to the beak, and the <a href="beak%23Nares">nostril</a> was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> pigeons than of other birds, both in their <a href="bird%20anatomy%23Scales">scales</a> and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large <a href="crop%20%28anatomy%29">crop</a> hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a>, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the <a href="vomer">vomer</a> and <a href="septum">septum</a> of the nostrils, and it shared details in the <a href="mandible">mandible</a>, the <a href="zygomatic%20bone">zygomatic bone</a>, the <a href="palate">palate</a>, and the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the <a href="cranium">cranium</a>.

Throughout the 19th century, several species were classified as <a href="conspecificity">congeneric</a> with the dodo, including the Rodrigues solitaire and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20solitaire">Réunion solitaire</a>, as "Didus solitarius" and "Raphus solitarius", respectively ("Didus" and "Raphus" being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time). An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led <a href="Abraham%20Dee%20Bartlett">Abraham Dee Bartlett</a> to name a new species, "Didus nazarenus", in 1852. Based on solitaire remains, it is now a synonym of that species. Crude drawings of the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a> of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> were also misinterpreted as dodo species; "Didus broeckii" and "Didus herberti".

For many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in its own <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had <a href="Convergent%20evolution">evolved their similarities independently</a>. <a href="Osteological">Osteological</a> and <a href="DNA%20analysis">DNA analysis</a> has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.

In 2002, American geneticist <a href="Beth%20Shapiro">Beth Shapiro</a> and colleagues analysed the DNA of the dodo for the first time. Comparison of <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> and 12S <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">rRNA</a> <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequences</a> isolated from a <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsal</a> of the Oxford specimen and a <a href="femur">femur</a> of a Rodrigues solitaire confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian <a href="Nicobar%20pigeon">Nicobar pigeon</a> ("Caloenas nicobarica") to be their closest living relative, followed by the <a href="crowned%20pigeon">crowned pigeon</a>s ("Goura") of <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and the superficially dodo-like <a href="tooth-billed%20pigeon">tooth-billed pigeon</a> ("Didunculus strigirostris") from <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> (its scientific name refers to its dodo-like beak). This <a href="clade">clade</a> consists of generally ground-dwelling island endemic pigeons. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the dodo's closest relationships within the Columbidae, based on Shapiro et al., 2002:

A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of "Goura" and "Dicunculus" and including the <a href="pheasant%20pigeon">pheasant pigeon</a> ("Otidiphaps nobilis") and the <a href="thick-billed%20ground%20pigeon">thick-billed ground pigeon</a> ("Trugon terrestris") at the base of the clade. The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings still need to be independently verified. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the subfamily <a href="Gourinae">Gourinae</a> along with the "Groura" pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct <a href="spotted%20green%20pigeon">spotted green pigeon</a> ("Caloenas maculata") was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.

The 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the dodo and the solitaire diverged around the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a>-<a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> boundary. The <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene Islands</a> (Mauritius, <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, and <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>), are of <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a>. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed at the base of a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the <a href="flightless">flightless</a> raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by <a href="island%20hopping">island hopping</a> from South Asia. The lack of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain <a href="island%20gigantism">very large sizes</a> and flightlessness. Despite its divergent skull morphology and adaptations for larger size, many features of its skeleton remained similar to those of smaller, flying pigeons. Another large, flightless pigeon, the <a href="Viti%20Levu%20giant%20pigeon">Viti Levu giant pigeon</a> ("Natunaornis gigoura"), was described in 2001 from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> material from <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>. It was only slightly smaller than the dodo and the solitaire, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.

One of the original names for the dodo was the Dutch ""Walghvogel"", first used in the journal of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited Mauritius during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598. "Walghe" means "tasteless", "insipid", or "sickly", and "vogel" means "bird". The name was translated into German as "Walchstök" or "Walchvögel", by Jakob Friedlib. The original Dutch report titled "Waarachtige Beschryving" was lost, but the English translation survived:
Another account from that voyage, perhaps the first to mention the dodo, states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins. The meaning may not have been derived from "<a href="penguin">penguin</a>" (the Portuguese referred to them as ""fotilicaios"" at the time), but from "<a href="pinioning">pinion</a>", a reference to the small wings. The crew of the Dutch ship "Gelderland" referred to the bird as "Dronte" (meaning "swollen") in 1602, a name that is still used in some languages. This crew also called them "griff-eendt" and "kermisgans", in reference to <a href="fowl">fowl</a> fattened for the <a href="Kermesse%20festival">Kermesse festival</a> in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, which was held the day after they anchored on Mauritius.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the word "dodo" is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word "dodoor" for "sluggard", but it is more probably related to "Dodaars", which means either "fat-arse" or "knot-arse", referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end. The first record of the word "Dodaars" is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen's journal in 1602. The English writer <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert">Sir Thomas Herbert</a> was the first to use the word "dodo" in print in his 1634 <a href="travel%20journal">travelogue</a>, claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the word in a 1628 letter, in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese. The name "dodar" was introduced into English at the same time as dodo, but was only used until the 18th century. As far as is known, the Portuguese never mentioned the bird. Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word "dodo" derives from the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> word "doudo" (currently "doido"), meaning "fool" or "crazy". It has also been suggested that "dodo" was an <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> approximation of the bird's call, a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling "doo-doo".

The Latin name "cucullatus" ("hooded") was first used by <a href="Juan%20Eusebio%20Nieremberg">Juan Eusebio Nieremberg</a> in 1635 as "<a href="Cygnus%20%28genus%29">Cygnus</a> cucullatus", in reference to <a href="Carolus%20Clusius">Carolus Clusius</a>'s 1605 depiction of a dodo. In his 18th-century classic work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> used "cucullatus" as the specific name, but combined it with the genus name "Struthio" (ostrich). <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> coined the genus name "Raphus" (referring to the <a href="bustard">bustard</a>s) in 1760, resulting in the current name "Raphus cucullatus". In 1766, Linnaeus coined the new binomial "Didus ineptus" (meaning "inept dodo"). This has become a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of the earlier name because of <a href="nomenclatural%20priority">nomenclatural priority</a>.

As no complete dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, is hard to determine. Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, with lighter <a href="primary%20feathers">primary feathers</a> and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study of the few remaining feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were <a href="pennaceous">pennaceous</a> rather than <a href="plumaceous">plumaceous</a> (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.

Subfossil remains and remnants of the birds that were brought to Europe in the 17th century show that dodos were very large birds, up to tall. 
The bird was <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>; males were larger and had proportionally longer beaks. Weight estimates have varied from study to study. In 1993, <a href="Bradley%20C.%20Livezey">Bradley C. Livezey</a> proposed that males would have weighed and females . Also in 1993, Andrew C. Kitchener attributed a high contemporary weight estimate and the roundness of dodos depicted in Europe to these birds having been overfed in captivity; weights in the wild were estimated to have been in the range of , and fattened birds could have weighed . A 2011 estimate by Angst and colleagues gave an average weight as low as . This has also been questioned, and there is still controversy over weight estimates. A 2016 study estimated the weight at , based on <a href="CT%20scans">CT scans</a> of composite skeletons. It has also been suggested that the weight depended on the season, and that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but less so during hot.

The skull of the dodo differed much from those of other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly twice as long as the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated along the length of the beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a> formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The <a href="sclerotic%20rings">sclerotic rings</a> inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a> (opening), as in other pigeons.

The dodo had about nineteen presynsacral vertebrae (those of the neck and <a href="thorax">thorax</a>, including three fused into a <a href="notarium">notarium</a>), sixteen <a href="synsacral">synsacral</a> vertebrae (those of the <a href="lumbar%20region">lumbar region</a> and <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a>. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the <a href="sternum">sternum</a> through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small in relation to the body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly <a href="pneumatic">pneumatic</a>, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a>, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The <a href="carpometacarpus">carpometacarpus</a> of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.

Many of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the <a href="pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> region and the small wings were <a href="neoteny">paedomorphic</a>, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> limbs were <a href="peramorphic">peramorphic</a>, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded <a href="skull%20roof">skull roof</a>, and smaller <a href="orbits">orbits</a>. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.

Most contemporary descriptions of the dodo are found in <a href="ship%27s%20logs">ship's logs</a> and journals of the Dutch East India Company vessels that docked in Mauritius when the <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch Empire</a> ruled the island. These records were used as guides for future voyages. Few contemporary accounts are reliable, as many seem to be based on earlier accounts, and none were written by scientists. One of the earliest accounts, from van Warwijck's 1598 journal, describes the bird as follows:

One of the most detailed descriptions is by Sir Thomas Herbert in "A Relation of Some Yeares Travaille into Afrique and the Greater Asia" from 1634:

The travel journal of the Dutch ship "Gelderland" (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They have been attributed to the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability.

The traditional image of the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today is that many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter <a href="Roelant%20Savery">Roelant Savery</a> was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least twelve depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called "Edwards's Dodo" as it was once owned by the ornithologist <a href="George%20Edwards%20%28naturalist%29">George Edwards</a>, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.

An Indian <a href="Mughal%20painting">Mughal painting</a> rediscovered in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> in the 1950s shows a dodo along with native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A. Iwanow and dodo specialist Julian Hume regard it as one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist <a href="Ustad%20Mansur">Ustad Mansur</a>. The bird depicted probably lived in the <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a> of <a href="Mughal%20Emperor">Mughal Emperor</a> <a href="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>, located in <a href="Surat">Surat</a>, where English traveller <a href="Peter%20Mundy">Peter Mundy</a> also claimed to have seen two dodos sometime between 1628 and 1633. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.

All post-1638 depictions appear to be based on earlier images, around the time reports mentioning dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as <a href="Anthonie%20Cornelis%20Oudemans">Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans</a> and <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> to speculate about sexual dimorphism, <a href="ontogenic">ontogenic</a> traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the "Gelderland", <a href="Cornelis%20Saftleven">Cornelis Saftleven</a>, Savery's <a href="Crocker%20Art%20Gallery">Crocker Art Gallery</a>, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a> specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to <a href="ratites">ratites</a> such as the ostrich and <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>.

Little is known of the behaviour of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a>, and may have been used for <a href="display%20behaviour">display behaviour</a> and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, there is no evidence that the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.

The preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view is supported by the fact that the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the "Gelderland" journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was <a href="l%27%C3%AEle%20aux%20Benitiers">l'île aux Benitiers</a> in <a href="Tamarin%20Bay">Tamarin Bay</a>, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by <a href="tambalacoque">tambalacoque</a> and "<a href="Pandanus">Pandanus</a>" trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.

Many endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The surviving endemic <a href="fauna">fauna</a> is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20blue%20pigeon">Mauritius blue pigeon</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20owl">Mauritius owl</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20coot">Mascarene coot</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20shelduck">Mauritian shelduck</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20duck">Mauritian duck</a>, and the <a href="Mauritius%20night%20heron">Mauritius night heron</a>. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the <a href="saddle-backed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="domed%20Mauritius%20giant%20tortoise">domed Mauritius giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="Mauritian%20giant%20skink">Mauritian giant skink</a>, and the <a href="Round%20Island%20burrowing%20boa">Round Island burrowing boa</a>. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as "<a href="Casearia%20tinifolia">Casearia tinifolia</a>" and the <a href="palm%20orchid">palm orchid</a>, have also become extinct.

A 1631 Dutch letter (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) is the only account of the dodo's diet, and also mentions that it used its beak for defence. The document uses <a href="word-play">word-play</a> to refer to the animals described, with dodos presumably being an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> for wealthy mayors:

In addition to fallen fruits, the dodo probably subsisted on nuts, seeds, bulbs, and roots. It has also been suggested that the dodo might have eaten <a href="crabs">crabs</a> and <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a>, like their relatives the crowned pigeons. Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys. Oudemans suggested that as Mauritius has marked dry and wet seasons, the dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season, when food was scarce; contemporary reports describe the bird's "greedy" appetite. <a href="France%20Staub">France Staub</a> suggested that they mainly fed on <a href="palm%20%28plant%29">palm</a> fruits, and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms.

Skeletal elements of the upper jaw appear to have been <a href="rhynchokinetic">rhynchokinetic</a> (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as <a href="frugivorous">frugivorous</a> (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic <a href="premaxillae">premaxillae</a> help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears to have been able to withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D <a href="endocast">endocast</a> was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.

Several contemporary sources state that the dodo used <a href="Gastrolith">Gastrolith</a>s (gizzard stones) to aid digestion. The English writer Sir <a href="Hamon%20L%27Estrange">Hamon L'Estrange</a> witnessed a live bird in London and described it as follows:

It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide <a href="crop%20milk">crop milk</a>. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was probably used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk. It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth.

In 1973, the tambalacoque, also known as the dodo tree, was thought to be dying out on Mauritius, to which it is <a href="endemic">endemic</a>. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. <a href="Stanley%20Temple">Stanley Temple</a> hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly <a href="coextinct">coextinct</a> because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being <a href="abrasion%20%28mechanical%29">abraded</a> during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as "<a href="Cylindraspis">Cylindraspis</a>" <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a>s, <a href="fruit%20bat">fruit bat</a>s or the broad-billed parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the <a href="ecology">ecology</a> of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.

The Brazilian ornithologist Carlos Yamashita suggested in 1997 that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and "Cylindraspis" tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. "<a href="Anodorhynchus">Anodorhynchus</a>" macaws depended on now-extinct <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.

As it was flightless and terrestrial and there were no <a href="mammalian">mammalian</a> predators or other kinds of natural enemy on Mauritius, the dodo probably nested on the ground. The account by François Cauche from 1651 is the only description of the egg and the <a href="Bird%20call">call</a>:
Cauche's account is problematic, since it also mentions that the bird he was describing had three toes and no tongue, unlike dodos. This led some to believe that Cauche was describing a new species of dodo (""Didus nazarenus""). The description was most probably mingled with that of a <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a>, and Cauche's writings have other inconsistencies. A mention of a "young ostrich" taken on board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile dodo. An egg claimed to be that of a dodo is stored in the museum of <a href="East%20London%2C%20South%20Africa">East London, South Africa</a>. It was donated by <a href="Marjorie%20Courtenay-Latimer">Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer</a>, whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed to have found it in a swamp on Mauritius. In 2010, the curator of the museum proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity. It may instead be an aberrant ostrich egg.

Because of the possible single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was <a href="K-selected">K-selected</a>, meaning that it produced a low number of <a href="altricial">altricial</a> offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.

A 2017 study examined the <a href="histology">histology</a> of <a href="thin-sectioned">thin-sectioned</a> dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred <a href="moulted">moulted</a> after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed at the end of July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.

Mauritius had previously been visited by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> vessels in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, but was settled by neither. No records of dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, "Cerne (swan) Island", may have been a reference to dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after <a href="Maurice%20of%20Nassau">Maurice of Nassau</a>, and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> henceforward. The earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by Dutch travelers during the <a href="Second%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia</a>, led by <a href="admiral">admiral</a> <a href="Jacob%20van%20Neck">Jacob van Neck</a> in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary. The 1602 journal by Willem Van West-Zanen of the ship "Bruin-Vis" mentions that 24–25 dodos were hunted for food, which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at mealtime, their remains being preserved by <a href="salting%20%28food%29">salting</a>. An illustration made for the 1648 published version of this journal, showing the killing of dodos, a <a href="dugong">dugong</a>, and possibly Mascarene grey parakeets, was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in Hugh Strickland's 1848 translation:
Some early travellers found dodo meat unsavoury, and preferred to eat parrots and pigeons; others described it as tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had to be careful not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.

The appearance of the dodo and the red rail led Peter Mundy to speculate, 230 years before <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>:

The dodo was found interesting enough that living specimens were sent to Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos that reached their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based on a combination of contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive.

Hamon L'Estrange's description of a dodo that he saw in London in 1638 is the only account that specifically mentions a live specimen in Europe. In 1626 <a href="Adriaen%20van%20de%20Venne">Adriaen van de Venne</a> drew a dodo that he claimed to have seen in Amsterdam, but he did not mention if it were alive, and his depiction is reminiscent of Savery's "Edwards's Dodo". Two live specimens were seen by Peter Mundy in Surat, India, between 1628 and 1634, one of which may have been the individual painted by Ustad Mansur around 1625. In 1628, Emmanuel Altham visited Mauritius and sent a letter to his brother in England:

Whether the dodo survived the journey is unknown, and the letter was destroyed by fire in the 19th century.
The earliest known picture of a dodo specimen in Europe is from a collection of paintings depicting animals in the royal menagerie of <a href="Emperor%20Rudolph%20II">Emperor Rudolph II</a> in Prague. This collection includes paintings of other Mauritian animals as well, including a red rail. The dodo, which may be a juvenile, seems to have been dried or embalmed, and had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals. That whole stuffed dodos were present in Europe indicates they had been brought alive and died there; it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. Most <a href="tropical">tropical</a> specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet.

One dodo was reportedly sent as far as <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a <a href="bezoar">bezoar</a> stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.

Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators, the dodo was entirely <a href="island%20tameness">fearless</a> of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered <a href="Maroon%20%28people%29">fugitive slaves</a> and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and <a href="crab-eating%20macaque">crab-eating macaque</a>s, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest <a href="habitat">habitat</a> of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since dodos would have been used to dealing with local <a href="land%20crabs">land crabs</a>.

It has been suggested that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.

Some controversy surrounds the date of their extinction. The last widely accepted record of a dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner Volkert Evertsz of the Dutch ship "<a href="Arnhem%20%28ship%29">Arnhem</a>", who described birds caught on a small islet off Mauritius, now suggested to be <a href="Islets%20of%20Mauritius%23%C3%8Ele%20D%27Ambre">Amber Island</a>:
The dodos on this islet may not necessarily have been the last members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of <a href="Isaac%20Johannes%20Lamotius">Isaac Johannes Lamotius</a> in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% <a href="confidence%20interval">confidence interval</a> of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.

Cheke pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names "Dodo" and "Dodaers" when referring to the red rail, indicating that they had been transferred to it after the disappearance of the dodo itself. Cheke therefore points to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. A 1668 account by English traveller John Marshall, who used the names "Dodo" and "Red Hen" interchangeably for the red rail, mentioned that the meat was "hard", which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by the writer <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a>, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail. Until this explanation was proposed, a description of "dodos" from 1681 was thought to be the last account, and that date still has proponents. Recently accessible Dutch manuscripts indicate that no dodos were seen by settlers in 1664–1674. It is unlikely the issue will ever be resolved, unless late reports mentioning the name alongside a physical description are rediscovered. The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> accepts Cheke's rationale for choosing the 1662 date, taking all subsequent reports to refer to red rails. In any case, the dodo was probably extinct by 1700, about a century after its discovery in 1598. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, but by then the dodo and most of the large terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct.

Even though the rareness of the dodo was reported already in the 17th century, its extinction was not recognised until the 19th century. This was partly because, for religious reasons, extinction was not believed possible until later proved so by <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, and partly because many scientists doubted that the dodo had ever existed. It seemed altogether too strange a creature, and many believed it a myth. The bird was first used as an example of human-induced extinction in "Penny Magazine" in 1833, and has since been referred to as an "icon" of extinction.

The only extant remains of dodos taken to Europe in the 17th century are a dried head and foot in the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Oxford University Museum of Natural History</a>, a foot once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen%20Zoological%20Museum">University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum</a>, and an upper jaw in the <a href="National%20Museum%2C%20Prague">National Museum, Prague</a>. The last two were rediscovered and identified as dodo remains in the mid-19th century. Several stuffed dodos were also mentioned in old museum inventories, but none are known to have survived. Apart from these remains, a dried foot, which belonged to the Dutch professor Pieter Pauw, was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in 1605. Its provenance is unknown, and it is now lost, but it may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage.

The only known soft tissue remains, the Oxford head (specimen OUM 11605) and foot, belonged to the last known stuffed dodo, which was first mentioned as part of the <a href="Tradescant%20collection">Tradescant collection</a> in 1656 and was moved to the <a href="Ashmolean%20Museum">Ashmolean Museum</a> in 1659. It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that Hamon L'Estrange saw in London, the bird sent by Emanuel Altham, or a donation by Thomas Herbert. Since the remains do not show signs of having been mounted, the specimen might instead have been preserved as a <a href="study%20skin">study skin</a>. In 2018, it was reported that scans of the Oxford dodo's head showed that its skin and bone contained <a href="lead%20shot">lead shot</a>, pellets which were used to hunt birds in the 17th century. This indicates that the Oxford dodo was shot either before being transported to Britain, or some time after arriving. The circumstances of its killing are unknown, and the pellets are to be examined to identify where the lead was mined from.

Many sources state that the Ashmolean Museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay, saving only the head and leg. Statute 8 of the museum states "That as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of the closets or other repository; and some other to be substituted." The deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth; it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it. This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further; the head was dissected by Strickland and Melville, separating the skin from the skull in two halves. The foot is in a skeletal state, with only scraps of skin and <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s. Very few feathers remain on the head. It is probably a female, as the foot is 11% smaller and more gracile than the London foot, yet appears to be fully grown. The specimen was exhibited at the Oxford museum from at least the 1860s and until 1998, where-after it was mainly kept in storage to prevent damage. Casts of the head can today be found in many museums worldwide.

The dried London foot, first mentioned in 1665, and transferred to the British Museum in the 18th century, was displayed next to Savery's "Edwards's Dodo" painting until the 1840s, and it too was dissected by Strickland and Melville. It was not posed in a standing posture, which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen, not a mounted one. By 1896 it was mentioned as being without its <a href="integument">integument</a>s, and only the bones are believed to remain today, though its present whereabouts are unknown.

The Copenhagen skull (specimen ZMUC 90-806) is known to have been part of the collection of Bernardus Paludanus in <a href="Enkhuizen">Enkhuizen</a> until 1651, when it was moved to the museum in <a href="Gottorf%20Castle">Gottorf Castle</a>, <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a>. After the castle was occupied by Danish forces in 1702, the museum collection was assimilated into the Royal Danish collection. The skull was rediscovered by J. T. Reinhardt in 1840. Based on its history, it may be the oldest known surviving remains of a dodo brought to Europe in the 17th century. It is shorter than the Oxford skull, and may have belonged to a female. It was <a href="mummified">mummified</a>, but the skin has perished.

The front part of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among the remains of the Böhmisches Museum. Other elements supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present (a partial right limb in the museum appears to be from a Rodrigues solitaire). It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.

Until 1860, the only known dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century specimens. <a href="Philip%20Burnard%20Ayres">Philip Burnard Ayres</a> found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a> <a href="Vincent%20Ryan%20%28bishop%29">Vincent Ryan</a> to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a> at <a href="Mah%C3%A9bourg">Mahébourg</a>, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to "<a href="The%20Ibis">The Ibis</a>", an ornithology journal: he had sent his <a href="coolies">coolies</a> to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of <a href="moa">moa</a> remains in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.

Clark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> both wanted to be first to describe the <a href="post-cranial">post-cranial</a> anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in "Memoir on the Dodo" in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the "Edwards's Dodo" painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the Réunion solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. In 1889, Théodor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the "historical souvenirs" of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes. He was successful, and also found remains of other extinct species.

In 2005, after a hundred years of neglect, a part of the Mare aux Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, the British had covered the swamp with <a href="Stone%20foundation">hard core</a> during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the <a href="Naturalis">Naturalis</a> museum in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct genus "Cylindraspis", and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.

Louis Etienne Thirioux, an amateur naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They included the first articulated specimen, which is the first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a>. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near <a href="Le%20Pouce">Le Pouce</a> mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute). Thrioux's heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the <a href="Durban%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20Science">Durban Museum of Natural Science</a> in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and various wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux's specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were <a href="laser%20scanned">laser scanned</a>, from which <a href="3-D%20computer%20graphics">3-D</a> models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the <a href="osteology">osteology</a> of the dodo. In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an individual specimen everfound, and the only one in recent times.

Worldwide, 26 museums have significant holdings of dodo material, almost all found in the Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Museum%20of%20Zoology">Cambridge University Museum of Zoology</a>, the <a href="Senckenberg%20Museum">Senckenberg Museum</a>, and others have almost complete skeletons, assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals. In 2011, a wooden box containing dodo bones from the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a> was rediscovered at the <a href="Grant%20Museum">Grant Museum</a> at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> during preparations for a move. They had been stored with crocodile bones until then.

The supposed "white dodo" (or "solitaire") of Réunion is now considered an erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20ibis">Réunion ibis</a> and 17th-century paintings of white, dodo-like birds by <a href="Pieter%20Withoos">Pieter Withoos</a> and <a href="Pieter%20Holsteyn%20II">Pieter Holsteyn</a> that surfaced in the 19th century. The confusion began when <a href="Willem%20Ysbrandtsz.%20Bontekoe">Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe</a>, who visited Réunion around 1619, mentioned fat, flightless birds that he referred to as "Dod-eersen" in his journal, though without mentioning their colouration. When the journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from Savery's "Crocker Art Gallery sketch". A white, stocky, and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the Réunion fauna by Chief Officer J. Tatton in 1625. Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a> and other contemporary writers.

Baron <a href="Edmond%20de%20S%C3%A9lys%20Longchamps">Edmond de Sélys Longchamps</a> coined the name "Raphus solitarius" for these birds in 1848, as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.

The Pieter Withoos painting, which was discovered first, appears to be based on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three versions of which are known to have existed. According to Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on Roelant Savery's painting "Landscape with Orpheus and the animals", or on copies of it. The painting has generally been dated to 1611, though a post-1614, or even post-1626, date has also been proposed. The painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a "walghvogel" described as having a "dirty off-white colouring" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II</a>, to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607–1611). Savery's several later images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen another specimen. Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was white, owing to <a href="albinism">albinism</a>. Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply artistic license.

In 1987, scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of <a href="ibis">ibis</a> from Réunion with a relatively short beak, "Borbonibis latipes", before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made. Cheke suggested to one of the authors, Francois Moutou, that the fossils may have been of the Réunion solitaire, and this suggestion was published in 1995. The ibis was reassigned to the genus "<a href="Threskiornis">Threskiornis</a>", now combined with the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "" from the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> "R. solitarius". Birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks, fitting the old descriptions of the Réunion solitaire. No fossil remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on the island.

The dodo's significance as one of the best-known extinct animals and its singular appearance led to its use in literature and popular culture as a symbol of an outdated concept or object, as in the expression "<a href="wikt%3Adead%20as%20a%20dodo">dead as a dodo</a>," which has come to mean unquestionably dead or obsolete. Similarly, the phrase "<a href="wikt%3Ago%20the%20way%20of%20the%20dodo">to go the way of the dodo</a>" means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past. "Dodo" is also a slang term for a stupid, dull-witted person, as it was supposedly stupid and easily caught.

The dodo appears frequently in works of popular fiction, and even before its extinction, it was featured in European literature, as symbol for exotic lands, and of gluttony, due to its apparent fatness. In 1865, the same year that George Clark started to publish reports about excavated dodo fossils, the newly vindicated bird was <a href="Dodo%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">featured as a character</a> in <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>". It is thought that he included the dodo because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for himself because of his stammer, which made him accidentally introduce himself as "Do-do-dodgson", his legal surname. Carroll and the girl who served as inspiration for Alice, <a href="Alice%20Liddell">Alice Liddell</a>, had enjoyed visiting the Oxford museum to see the dodo remains there. The book's popularity made the dodo a well-known icon of extinction.
The dodo is used as a <a href="mascot">mascot</a> for many kinds of products, especially in Mauritius. It appears as a <a href="supporter">supporter</a> on the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Mauritius">coat of arms of Mauritius</a>, on Mauritius coins, is used as a <a href="watermark">watermark</a> on all <a href="Mauritian%20rupee">Mauritian rupee</a> banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the <a href="Brasseries%20de%20Bourbon">Brasseries de Bourbon</a>, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there.

The dodo is used to promote the protection of <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> by environmental organisations, such as the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> and the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Park">Durrell Wildlife Park</a>. The <a href="Center%20for%20Biological%20Diversity">Center for Biological Diversity</a> gives an annual 'Rubber Dodo Award', to "those who have done the most to destroy wild places, species and biological diversity". In 2011, the <a href="Nephilinae">nephiline</a> spider "<a href="Nephilengys%20dodo">Nephilengys dodo</a>", which inhabits the same woods as the dodo once did, was named after the bird to raise awareness of the urgent need for protection of the Mauritius <a href="biota%20%28ecology%29">biota</a>. Two species of <a href="ant">ant</a> from Mauritius have been named after the dodo: "<a href="Pseudolasius%20dodo">Pseudolasius dodo</a>" in 1946 and "<a href="Pheidole%20dodo">Pheidole dodo</a>" in 2013. A species of <a href="isopod">isopod</a> from a <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a> off Réunion was named "<a href="Hansenium%20dodo">Hansenium dodo</a>" in 1991. The name dodo has been used by scientists naming genetic elements, honoring the dodo's flightless nature. A fruitfly gene within a region of a chromosome required for flying ability was named "dodo". In addition, a defective <a href="transposable%20element">transposable element</a> family from "<a href="Phytophthora%20infestans">Phytophthora infestans</a>" was named "DodoPi" as it contained mutations that eliminated the element's ability to jump to new locations in a chromosome. 

In 2009, a previously unpublished 17th-century Dutch illustration of a dodo went for sale at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> and was expected to sell for £6,000. It is unknown whether the illustration was based on a specimen or on a previous image. It sold for £44,450.

The poet <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> included the following poem about the dodo in his "<a href="The%20Bad%20Child%27s%20Book%20of%20Beasts">Bad Child's Book of Beasts</a>" from 1896:

Dubnium

Dubnium is a synthetic <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Db and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 105. Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known <a href="isotopes%20of%20dubnium">isotope</a>, dubnium-268, has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of about 28 hours. This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium.

Dubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially. The Soviet <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</a> in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party</a>, resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named "dubnium" in 1997 after the town of <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, the site of the JINR.

Theoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of <a href="group%205%20element">group 5</a> in the 6d series of <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s, placing it under <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a>, <a href="niobium">niobium</a>, and <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a>. Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to <a href="relativistic%20effects">relativistic effects</a>. A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this. Solution chemistry experiments have revealed that dubnium often behaves more like niobium rather than tantalum, breaking <a href="periodic%20trends">periodic trends</a>.

<a href="Uranium">Uranium</a>, element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantity in nature; heavier elements can only be produced practically by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element—<a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>, element 93—was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States. In the following years, American scientists synthesized the elements up to <a href="mendelevium">mendelevium</a>, element 101, which was synthesized in 1955. From element 102, the priority of discoveries was contested between American and Soviet physicists. Their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries, later named the <a href="Transfermium%20Wars">Transfermium Wars</a>.

The first report of the <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">discovery of element 105</a> came from the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, <a href="Moscow%20Oblast">Moscow Oblast</a>, <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Russian SFSR</a>, <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, in April 1968. The scientists bombarded <a href="americium-243">Am</a> with a beam of <a href="neon-22">Ne</a> ions, and reported 9.4 MeV (with a half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7 MeV ("t" > 0.05 s) <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha activities</a> followed by alpha activities similar to those of either 103 or 103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to 105 and 105, respectively.

After observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14 ms and . They assigned the former activity to Am and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the Am-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (Ne,"x"n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a Am target with O ions; reactions producing 103 and 103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 103 and 103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.

In April 1970, a team at <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</a> (LBL), in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, United States, claimed to have synthesized element 105 by bombarding <a href="californium-249">californium-249</a> with <a href="nitrogen-15">nitrogen-15</a> ions, with an alpha activity of 9.1 MeV. To ensure this activity was not from a different reaction, the team attempted other reactions: bombarding Cf with N, Pb with N, and Hg with N. They stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of 103, implying that the parent nuclei were of 105.

These results did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4 MeV or 9.7 MeV alpha decay of 105, leaving only 105 as a possibly produced isotope.

JINR then attempted another experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably 105, or possibly 105. This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of <a href="Niobium%28V%29%20chloride">niobium pentachloride</a>, rather than <a href="hafnium%20tetrachloride">hafnium tetrachloride</a>. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.

In June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a <a href="collimator">collimator</a> before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1 MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 103 or 103, implying that the original isotope was either 105 or 105.

JINR did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element 105, which would have been the usual practice. This led LBL to believe that JINR did not have enough experimental data to back their claim. After collecting more data, JINR proposed the name "nielsbohrium" (Ns) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, a founder of the theories of <a href="atomic%20structure">atomic structure</a> and <a href="Old%20quantum%20theory">quantum theory</a>. When LBL first announced their synthesis of element 105, they proposed that the new element be named "hahnium" (Ha) after the German chemist <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a>, the "father of nuclear chemistry", thus creating an <a href="element%20naming%20controversy">element naming controversy</a>.

In the early 1970s, both teams reported synthesis of the next element, element 106, but did not suggest names. JINR suggested establishing an international committee to clarify the discovery criteria. This proposal was accepted in 1974 and a neutral joint group formed. Neither team showed interest in resolving the conflict through a third party, so the leading scientists of LBL—<a href="Albert%20Ghiorso">Albert Ghiorso</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a>—traveled to Dubna in 1975 and met with the leading scientists of JINR—<a href="Georgy%20Flerov">Georgy Flerov</a>, <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>, and others— to try to resolve the conflict internally and render the neutral joint group unnecessary; after two hours of discussions, this failed. The joint neutral group never assembled to assess the claims and the conflict remained unsolved. In 1979, IUPAC suggested <a href="systematic%20element%20name">systematic element name</a>s to be used as placeholders until permanent names were established; under it, element 105 would be "unnilpentium", from the Latin roots "un-" and "nil-" and the Greek root "pent-" (meaning "one", "zero", and "five", respectively, the digits of the atomic number). Both teams ignored it as they did not wish to weaken their outstanding claims.

In 1981, the <a href="Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20Schwerionenforschung">Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung</a> (GSI; "Society for Heavy Ion Research") in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, West Germany, claimed synthesis of element 107; their report came out five years after the first report from JINR but with greater precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. GSI acknowledged JINR's efforts by suggesting the name "nielsbohrium" for the new element. JINR did not suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to determine its discoverers first.

In 1985, the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) and the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Physics">International Union of Pure and Applied Physics</a> (IUPAP) formed a <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">Joint Working Party</a> (JWP) to assess discoveries and establish final names for the controversial elements. The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognition of an element, and in 1991, they finished the work on assessing discoveries and disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 LBL experiment, closely followed by the June 1970 JINR experiment, so credit for the discovery of the element should be shared between the two teams.

LBL said that the input from JINR was overrated in the review. They claimed JINR was only able to unambiguously demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 a year after they did. JINR and GSI endorsed the report.

In 1994, IUPAC published a recommendation on naming the disputed elements. For element 105, they proposed "joliotium" (Jl) after the French physicist <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a>, a contributor to the development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called <a href="nobelium">nobelium</a>. This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names "rutherfordium" and "hahnium", originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name "seaborgium" for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the 1993 report had given the LBL team the sole credit for its discovery.

In 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise. They suggested "seaborgium" for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all the other American proposals, except for the established name "lawrencium" for element 103. The equally entrenched name "nobelium" for element 102 was replaced by "flerovium" after Georgy Flerov, following the recognition by the 1993 report that that element had been first synthesized in Dubna. This was rejected by American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name "<a href="flerovium">flerovium</a>" was later used for element 114.

In 1996, IUPAC held another meeting, reconsidered all names in hand, and accepted another set of recommendations; it was approved and published in 1997. Element 105 was named "dubnium" (Db), after <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a> in Russia, the location of the JINR; the American suggestions were used for elements 102, 103, 104, and 106. The name "dubnium" had been used for element 104 in the previous IUPAC recommendation. The American scientists "reluctantly" approved this decision. IUPAC pointed out that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times, in the naming of <a href="berkelium">berkelium</a>, <a href="californium">californium</a>, and <a href="americium">americium</a>, and that the acceptance of the names "rutherfordium" and "seaborgium" for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing JINR's contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105, and 106.

Dubnium, having an <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> of 105, is a <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>; like all elements with such high atomic numbers, it is very unstable. The longest-lasting known isotope of dubnium, Db, has a half-life of around a day. No stable isotopes have been seen, and a 2012 calculation by JINR suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes would not significantly exceed a day. Dubnium can only be obtained by artificial production.

The short half-life of dubnium limits experimentation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the most stable isotopes are the hardest to synthesize. Elements with a lower atomic number have stable isotopes with a lower neutron-to-proton ratio than those with higher atomic number, meaning that the target and beam nuclei that could be employed to create the superheavy element have fewer neutrons than needed to form these most stable isotopes. (Different techniques based on <a href="r-process">rapid neutron capture</a> and <a href="Nuclear%20reaction%23Transfer%20reactions">transfer reactions</a> are being considered as of the 2010s, but those based on the collision of a large and small nucleus still dominate research in the area.)

Only a few atoms of Db can be produced in each experiment, and thus the measured lifetimes vary significantly during the process. During three experiments, 23 atoms were created in total, with a resulting half-life of . The second most stable isotope, Db, has been produced in even smaller quantities: three atoms in total, with lifetimes of 33.4 h, 1.3 h, and 1.6 h. These two are the heaviest isotopes of dubnium to date, and both were produced as a result of decay of the heavier nuclei <a href="moscovium">Mc</a> and <a href="tennessine">Ts</a> rather than directly, because the experiments that yielded them were originally designed in Dubna for <a href="calcium-48">Ca</a> beams. For its mass, Ca has by far the greatest neutron excess of all practically stable nuclei, both quantitative and relative, which correspondingly helps synthesize superheavy nuclei with more neutrons, but this gain is compensated by the decreased likelihood of fusion for high atomic numbers.

According to the <a href="periodic%20law">periodic law</a>, dubnium should belong to group 5, with <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a>, <a href="niobium">niobium</a>, and <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a>. Several studies have investigated the properties of element 105 and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of the periodic law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to <a href="relativistic%20effects">relativistic effects</a>, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. These properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons: the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms, the low rates of production, which only allows for microscopic scales, requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms, short half-lives of those atoms, and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms. So far, studies have only been performed on single atoms.

A direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of <a href="electromagnetic%20attraction">electromagnetic attraction</a> between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s <a href="Atomic%20orbital">orbitals</a> (and p ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6 <a href="electronvolt">eV</a>.

A more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p orbitals <a href="shielding%20effect">shield</a> the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.
Another effect is the <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a>, particularly spin–orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell—the <a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number">azimuthal quantum number</a> ℓ of a d shell is 2—into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d.)

A singly ionized atom of dubnium (Db) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db) or triply (Db) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry.

Atoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> configuration, like the previous group 5 elements. The predicted density of dubnium is 29 g/cm.

Computational chemistry is simplest in <a href="gas-phase%20chemistry">gas-phase chemistry</a>, in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible. Multiple authors have researched dubnium pentachloride; calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group 5 element. For example, the <a href="molecular%20orbital">molecular orbital</a> levels indicate that dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. Compared to its tantalum analog, dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a> character: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).

Calculations of <a href="Aqueous%20solution">solution</a> chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the +3 and +4 states will be less stable. The tendency towards <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group 5 but is still expected to be quite rapid. <a href="Complexation">Complexation</a> of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.

Experimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to 1974 and 1976. JINR researchers used a <a href="wikt%3Athermochromatography">thermochromatographic</a> system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide. It is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. These results may imply that dubnium behaves more like <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> than niobium.

The next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in 1988, in Berkeley. They examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>; <a href="sorption">sorption</a> of dubnium on glass <a href="cover%20slip">cover slip</a>s was then compared with that of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces; the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. Surprisingly, the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a> solution into <a href="methyl%20isobutyl%20ketone">methyl isobutyl ketone</a> differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.

This prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and <a href="protactinium">protactinium</a> were extracted from concentrated <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>; after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 <a href="Molar%20concentration">moles per liter</a>. This similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either or . After extraction experiments of dubnium from <a href="hydrobromic%20acid">hydrogen bromide</a> into <a href="diisobutyl%20carbinol">diisobutyl carbinol</a> (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium. This was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, like the group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.

The first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in 1992 with Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of , which was predicted to be less volatile than . Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, with the exception of tantalum, presumably due to formation of . Later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.

In 2004–05, researchers from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, Db, as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created <a href="moscovium">element 115</a>. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation, with a half-life of over a day. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in <a href="aqua%20regia">aqua regia</a> with tracers and a <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> carrier, from which various +3, +4, and +5 species were precipitated on adding <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a>. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted. Mostly containing a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, it also had a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further in both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and never in niobium-only fractions. It was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.

In 2009, at the JAEA tandem accelerator in Japan, dubnium was processed in nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution, at concentrations where niobium forms and tantalum forms . Dubnium's behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum; it was thus deduced that dubnium formed . From the available information, it was concluded that dubnium often behaved like niobium, sometimes like protactinium, but rarely like tantalum.

Domitian

Domitian (; ; 24 October 51 – 18 September 96 AD) was <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> from 81 to 96. He was the younger brother of <a href="Titus">Titus</a> and the son of <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the <a href="Flavian%20dynasty">Flavian dynasty</a>. During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the <a href="Roman%20senate">senate</a>, whose powers he drastically curtailed.

Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a>. His 15-year reign was the longest since that of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>. As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman coinage</a>, expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general <a href="Gnaeus%20Julius%20Agricola">Agricola</a> attempted to conquer <a href="Caledonia">Caledonia</a> (<a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>), and in <a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>, where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king <a href="Decebalus">Decebalus</a>. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics; he saw himself as the new <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, an <a href="Enlightened%20despotism">enlightened despot</a> destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance. Religious, military, and cultural <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> fostered a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a>, and by nominating himself perpetual <a href="Roman%20censor">censor</a>, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>.

Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor <a href="Nerva">Nerva</a>. After his death, Domitian's memory was <a href="damnatio%20memoriae">condemned to oblivion</a> by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>, and <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.

Domitian was born in Rome on 24 October 51, the youngest son of <a href="Vespasian">Titus Flavius Vespasianus</a>—commonly known as Vespasian—and <a href="Domitilla%20the%20Elder">Flavia Domitilla Major</a>. He had an older sister, <a href="Domitilla%20the%20Younger">Domitilla the Younger</a>, and brother, also named <a href="Titus">Titus Flavius Vespasianus</a>.

Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century. One such family, the Flavians, or "gens <a href="Flavia%20%28gens%29">Flavia</a>", rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the <a href="Julio-Claudian%20dynasty">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>. Domitian's great-grandfather, <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Petro">Titus Flavius Petro</a>, had served as a <a href="centurion">centurion</a> under <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> during <a href="Caesar%27s%20civil%20war">Caesar's civil war</a>. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pharsalus">Battle of Pharsalus</a> in 48 BC.

Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upward mobility of Petro's son <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Sabinus%20%28father%20of%20Vespasian%29">Titus Flavius Sabinus I</a>, Domitian's grandfather. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible <a href="equestrian%20%28Roman%29">equestrian</a> status through his services as <a href="tax%20collector">tax collector</a> in Asia and banker in <a href="Helvetia">Helvetia</a> (modern Switzerland). By marrying <a href="Vespasia%20Polla">Vespasia Polla</a> he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious "gens Vespasia", ensuring the elevation of his sons <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Sabinus%20%28consul%2047%29">Titus Flavius Sabinus II</a> and Vespasian to <a href="Roman%20Senate">senatorial</a> rank.

The <a href="cursus%20honorum">political career</a> of Vespasian included the offices of <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>, <a href="aedile">aedile</a>, and <a href="praetor">praetor</a>, and culminated in a <a href="Roman%20consul">consulship</a> in 51, the year of Domitian's birth. As a military commander, Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">Roman invasion of Britain</a> in 43. Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing, even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> (37–41) and <a href="Nero">Nero</a> (54–68). Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> (41–54) and his son <a href="Britannicus">Britannicus</a>.

By all appearances, the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of the <a href="Africa%20Province">Africa Province</a> in 63, and accompanying the emperor Nero during an official tour of Greece in 66.

That same year Jews from the <a href="Iudaea%20Province">Province of Judaea</a> revolted against the Roman Empire, sparking what is now known as the <a href="First%20Jewish-Roman%20War">First Jewish-Roman War</a>. Vespasian was assigned to lead the <a href="Roman%20army">Roman army</a> against the insurgents, with Titus — who had completed his military education by this time — in charge of a legion.

Of the three Flavian emperors, Domitian would rule the longest, despite the fact that his youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his older brother. Titus had gained military renown during the <a href="First%20Jewish%E2%80%93Roman%20War">First Jewish–Roman War</a>. After their father <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> became emperor in 69 following the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> known as the <a href="Year%20of%20the%20Four%20Emperors">Year of the Four Emperors</a>, Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.

By the time he was 16 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in <a href="Germania">Germania</a> and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish–Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as <a href="Praefectus%20urbi">city prefect</a> of Rome; or possibly even <a href="Nerva">Marcus Cocceius Nerva</a>, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.

He received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and <a href="literature">literature</a>. In his biography in the "<a href="On%20the%20Life%20of%20the%20Caesars">Lives of the Twelve Caesars</a>", <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as <a href="Homer">Homer</a> or <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were <a href="poetry">poetry</a>, as well as writings on law and administration.

Unlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court. Whether he received formal military training is not recorded, but according to Suetonius, he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow. A detailed description of Domitian's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius, who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality:

Domitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of <a href="hair%20care">hair care</a>. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.

Historian Brian Jones concludes in "The Emperor Domitian" that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes <a href="Self-deprecation">self-deprecating</a> sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.

This ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> of 69, which brought his family to power.

On 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a> and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the <a href="Year%20of%20the%20Four%20Emperors">Year of the Four Emperors</a>, during which the four most influential generals in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>—<a href="Galba">Galba</a>, <a href="Otho">Otho</a>, <a href="Vitellius">Vitellius</a> and Vespasian—successively vied for imperial power.

News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of <a href="Hispania%20Tarraconensis">Hispania Tarraconensis</a> (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.

Before reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of <a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a> (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.

Otho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital <a href="History%20of%20Roman%20Egypt">province of Egypt</a>, which controlled the <a href="Grain%20supply%20to%20the%20city%20of%20Rome">grain supply to Rome</a>. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire <a href="Cohortes%20urbanae">city garrison</a> of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.

When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bedriacum">First Battle of Bedriacum</a>, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with <a href="Mucianus">Gaius Licinius Mucianus</a>, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.
In Rome, Domitian was placed under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression. Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bedriacum%23Second%20Battle%20of%20Bedriacum">Second Battle of Bedriacum</a>, which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.

In despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a>—the imperial <a href="bodyguard">bodyguard</a>—considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty. On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the <a href="Temple%20of%20Concord">Temple of Concord</a> but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the <a href="Capitoline%20Hill">Capitoline Hill</a>.

During the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of <a href="Isis">Isis</a> and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.

By the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of "<a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Caesar</a>" and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house. The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.

Although the war had officially ended, a state of <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a> and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of "Caesar" and was appointed <a href="praetor">praetor</a> with consular power.

The ancient historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely <a href="wikt%3ANominal">nominal</a>, however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's <a href="wikt%3AEntourage">entourage</a>, promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and <a href="Antonius%20Primus">Antonius Primus</a> and replacing them with more reliable men such as <a href="Marcus%20Arrecinus%20Clemens%20%28prefect%2070%29">Arrecinus Clemens</a>.

Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the <a href="Batavian%20rebellion">Batavian revolt</a> in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. <a href="Batavians">Batavian</a> auxiliaries of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> legions, led by <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Civilis">Gaius Julius Civilis</a>, had rebelled with the aid of a faction of <a href="Treveri">Treveri</a> under the command of <a href="Julius%20Classicus">Julius Classicus</a>. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law <a href="Quintus%20Petillius%20Cerialis">Quintus Petillius Cerialis</a>.

Although the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.

When news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours. Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed. With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.

Where his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, <a href="Julia%20Flavia">Julia Flavia</a>, but Domitian was adamant in his love for <a href="Domitia%20Longina">Domitia Longina</a>, going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself. Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Corbulo">Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo</a>, a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed <a href="Pisonian%20conspiracy">Pisonian conspiracy</a> against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.

In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83. Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of "<a href="Augusta%20%28honorific%29">Augusta</a>" upon Domitia, while their son was <a href="apotheosis">deified</a>, appearing as such on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of coin types from this period. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly <a href="exile">exile</a>d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the <a href="amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a>, while the Jewish writer <a href="Flavius%20Josephus">Josephus</a> speaks of benefits he received from her. It is not known whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to have been happy.

Prior to becoming Emperor, Domitian's role in the Flavian government was largely ceremonial. In June 71, Titus returned triumphant from the war in Judaea. Ultimately, the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people, a majority of whom were Jewish. The city and <a href="Second%20Temple">temple of Jerusalem</a> were completely destroyed, its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army, and nearly 100,000 people were captured and enslaved.

For his victory, the Senate awarded Titus a <a href="Roman%20triumph">Roman triumph</a>. On the day of the festivities, the Flavian family rode into the capital, preceded by a lavish parade that displayed the spoils of the war. The family procession was headed by Vespasian and Titus, while Domitian, riding a magnificent <a href="White%20%28horse%29">white horse</a>, followed with the remaining Flavian relatives.

Leaders of the Jewish resistance were executed in the <a href="Forum%20Romanum">Forum Romanum</a>, after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the <a href="Temple%20of%20Jupiter%20%28Capitoline%20Hill%29">Temple of Jupiter</a>. A <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, the <a href="Arch%20of%20Titus">Arch of Titus</a>, was erected at the south-east entrance to the Forum to commemorate the successful end of the war.

Yet the return of Titus further highlighted the comparative insignificance of Domitian, both militarily and politically. As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared <a href="tribune">tribunician power</a> with his father, received seven consulships, the <a href="Roman%20censor">censorship</a>, and was given <a href="Praetorian%20prefect">command</a> of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire. As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as "Caesar" or "<a href="Princeps">Princeps</a> Iuventutis", and several priesthoods, including those of "<a href="augur">augur</a>", "<a href="pontifex">pontifex</a>", "<a href="Arval%20Brethren">frater arvalis</a>", "magister frater arvalium", and "sacerdos collegiorum omnium", but no office with "<a href="imperium">imperium</a>".

He held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious <a href="suffect%20consul">suffect consul</a>ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January. While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.

Under Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of <a href="democracy">democracy</a>.

Because Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June, 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor "imperium" of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.

Two major disasters struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, <a href="79%20eruption%20of%20Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius erupted</a>, burying the surrounding cities of <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and <a href="Herculaneum">Herculaneum</a> under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings. Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property. On 13 September 81 after barely two years in office, he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the <a href="Sabine">Sabine</a> territories.

Ancient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother, either by directly accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known <a href="bias">bias</a> of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.

Whatever the nature of their relationship, Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the <a href="Castra%20Praetoria">Praetorian camp</a> where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of <a href="Pontifex%20Maximus">Pontifex Maximus</a>, and the titles of "<a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a>" ("venerable"), and "<a href="Pater%20Patriae">Pater Patriae</a>" ("father of the country").

As Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign. By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial <a href="court">court</a>, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a <a href="Divine%20Right%20of%20Kings">divine monarchy</a> with himself as the <a href="Enlightened%20absolutism">benevolent despot</a> at its head.

In addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a>. To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>.

Despite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: <a href="edict">edict</a>s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. According to Suetonius, the imperial <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among <a href="Roman%20governor">provincial governors</a> and elected officials.

Although he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members, a policy that stood in contrast to the <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.

The reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the <a href="Flavian%20Palace">Flavian Palace</a> on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a>, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.

For his personal use he was active in constructing many monumental buildings including the <a href="Villa%20of%20Domitian">Villa of Domitian</a>, a vast and sumptuous palace situated 20 km outside Rome in the Alban Hills.

In Rome itself he built the <a href="Palace%20of%20Domitian">Palace of Domitian</a> on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a>.

Six other villas are linked with Domitian at <a href="Tusculum">Tusculum</a>, <a href="Antium">Antium</a>, Caieta, <a href="Monte%20Circeo">Circei</a>, Anxur and <a href="Baiae">Baiae</a>. Only the one at Circei has been identified today, where its remains can be visited by the Lago di Paola.

The <a href="Stadium%20of%20Domitian">Stadium of Domitian</a> was dedicated in 86 AD as a gift to the people of Rome as part of an Imperial building programme following the damage or destruction of most of the buildings on the Field of Mars by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics, and today occupied by the <a href="Piazza%20Navona">Piazza Navona</a>.

Domitian's tendency towards <a href="micromanagement">micromanagement</a> was nowhere more evident than in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman currency</a> dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the <a href="denarius">denarius</a> from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87 grams to 3.26 grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a <a href="devaluation">devaluation</a> of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04 grams respectively.

Nevertheless, the new values were still higher than the levels that Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years. Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.

Jones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion <a href="sestertius">sestertii</a>, of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army. The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome. At the time of Domitian's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20Rome">Great Fire of 64</a>, the civil war of 69 and the fire in 80.

Much more than a renovation project, Domitian's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural <a href="renaissance">renaissance</a>. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus. Among the most important new structures were an <a href="Odeon%20of%20Domitian">odeon</a>, a <a href="Stadium%20of%20Domitian">stadium</a>, and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect <a href="Rabirius%20%28architect%29">Rabirius</a>.

The most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a <a href="gilding">gilded</a> roof. Among those completed were the <a href="Temple%20of%20Vespasian%20and%20Titus">Temple of Vespasian and Titus</a>, the Arch of Titus and the <a href="Colosseum">Colosseum</a>, to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.

In order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or "<a href="congiarium">congiaria</a>", throughout Domitian's reign. The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the <a href="Capitoline%20Games">Capitoline Games</a>, a quadrennial contest comprising <a href="Athletic%20sport">athletic displays</a>, <a href="chariot%20racing">chariot racing</a>, and competitions for <a href="Public%20speaking">oratory</a>, music and acting.

Domitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.

The military campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare. His most significant military contribution was the development of the <a href="Limes%20Germanicus">Limes Germanicus</a>, which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire. Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a>, and across the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> frontier against the <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, the <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>, and the <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a>.

The conquest of Britain continued under the command of <a href="Gnaeus%20Julius%20Agricola">Gnaeus Julius Agricola</a>, who expanded the Roman Empire as far as <a href="Caledonia">Caledonia</a>, or modern day <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Domitian also founded a new <a href="Roman%20legion">legion</a> in 82, the <a href="Legio%20I%20Minervia">Legio I Minervia</a>, to fight against the Chatti. Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman presence, the rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, in present-day <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.

Domitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however. Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a "mock triumph", and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.

Nevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns—more than any emperor since Augustus—and raising their pay by one-third. While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.

Once Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a <a href="census">census</a>, and suddenly ordered an attack on the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a>. For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75 kilometres (46 mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.

Although little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of "Germanicus". Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as "uncalled for", and a "mock triumph". The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.

One of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84. Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).

In 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few <a href="auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliaries</a>. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was in fact a small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.

Turning his attention from Ireland, the following year Agricola raised a fleet and pushed beyond the <a href="River%20Forth">Forth</a> into Caledonia. To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at <a href="Inchtuthil">Inchtuthil</a>. In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by <a href="Calgacus">Calgacus</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons%20Graupius">Battle of Mons Graupius</a>. Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a>, ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.

In 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era. Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.

Not long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the <a href="Dacia">Kingdom of Dacia</a> in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic <a href="Withdrawal%20%28military%29">withdrawal</a> of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120 kilometres (75 mi) further south. The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.

The most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King <a href="Decebalus">Decebalus</a>, crossed the Danube into the province of <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>, wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor <a href="Oppius%20Sabinus">Oppius Sabinus</a>.

Domitian quickly launched a <a href="counterattack">counteroffensive</a>, personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect <a href="Cornelius%20Fuscus">Cornelius Fuscus</a>. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.

The victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia. Fuscus was killed, and the <a href="Aquila%20%28Roman%29">battle standard</a> of the Praetorian Guard was lost. The loss of the battle standard, or "aquila", was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.

Domitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of <a href="Tettius%20Julianus">Tettius Julianus</a>, and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished. An attack on the Dacian capital <a href="Sarmizegetusa%20Regia">Sarmizegetusa</a> was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.

In order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces. Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged. For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful <a href="client%20state">client kingdom</a>, but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.

Domitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.

Domitian firmly believed in the traditional <a href="Religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman religion</a>, and personally saw to it that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a>, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small <a href="chapel">chapel</a> dedicated to "Jupiter Conservator" was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to "Jupiter Custos".

The goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.

Domitian also revived the practice of the <a href="imperial%20cult%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">imperial cult</a>, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of "Dominus et Deus" ("Lord and God"). However, not only did he reject the title of "Dominus" during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.

To foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> on the site of Vespasian's former house on the <a href="Quirinal%20Hill">Quirinal</a>, and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother. To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.

Construction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the "<a href="Lex%20Julia">Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis</a>", under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.

Domitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> was suspected. He ensured that <a href="libel">libel</a>lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for <a href="satire">satire</a> at the expense of the government. Consequently, he forbade <a href="mime">mime</a>s from appearing on stage in public.

In 87, <a href="Vestal%20Virgin">Vestal Virgin</a>s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted <a href="incest">incest</a>. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be <a href="Premature%20burial">buried alive</a>.

Foreign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of <a href="Commodus">Commodus</a>. Veneration of <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a> and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.

4th century writings by <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> maintain that Jews and <a href="Christianity">Christians</a> were heavily <a href="Persecution%20of%20Christians%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire%23Under%20Domitian">persecuted</a> toward the end of Domitian's reign. The <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> is thought by some to have been written during this period. Although Jews were heavily taxed, no contemporary authors mention trials or executions based on <a href="religious%20offense">religious offense</a>s other than those within the Roman religion.

On 1 January 89, the governor of <a href="Germania%20Superior">Germania Superior</a>, <a href="Lucius%20Antonius%20Saturninus">Lucius Antonius Saturninus</a>, and his two legions at <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Legio%20XIV%20Gemina">Legio XIV Gemina</a> and <a href="Legio%20XXI%20Rapax">Legio XXI Rapax</a>, revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of the Germanic Chatti people. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it appears to have been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a> towards Decebalus.

At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The <a href="Roman%20governors%20of%20Germania%20Inferior">governor of Germania Inferior</a>, <a href="Aulus%20Bucius%20Lappius%20Maximus">Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus</a>, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of <a href="Rhaetia">Rhaetia</a>, <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Norbanus">Titus Flavius Norbanus</a>. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.

By a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.

Lappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with <a href="Titus%20Petronius%20Secundus">Titus Petronius Secundus</a> as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.

Although little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.

Since the fall of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Republic</a>, the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the <a href="Principate">Principate</a>. The Principate allowed the existence of a "de facto" dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a "de facto" monarch.

Some rulers handled this arrangement with less subtlety than others. Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his <a href="autocracy">autocracy</a>. He disliked <a href="aristocracy">aristocrats</a> and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.

The dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion <a href="Damnatio%20memoriae">condemning his memory</a> to oblivion. Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.

Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.

Both Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89. At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed, including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Sabinus%20%28consul%20AD%2082%29">Titus Flavius Sabinus</a>, <a href="Titus%20Flavius%20Clemens%20%28consul%29">Titus Flavius Clemens</a> and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens. Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85, however, lending little credit to Tacitus' notion of a "reign of terror" late in Domitian's reign. According to Suetonius, some were convicted for corruption or treason, others on trivial charges, which Domitian justified through his suspicion:

Jones compares the executions of Domitian to those under Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> (41–54), noting that Claudius executed around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.

Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96 in a conspiracy by court officials. A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius. He alleges that Domitian's chamberlain Parthenius played the main role in the plot, citing the recent execution of Domitian's secretary <a href="Epaphroditos">Epaphroditus</a> as his primary motive. The act itself was carried out by a freedman of his named Maximus, and a steward of Domitian's niece <a href="Flavia%20Domitilla%20%28saint%29">Flavia Domitilla</a>, named Stephanus.

According to Suetonius, a number of <a href="omen">omen</a>s had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a> had appeared to the emperor in a dream. She announced that she had been disarmed by <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> and could no longer give Domitian her protection. According to an <a href="Augury">auspice</a> he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon. Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees. Stephanus, who had been feigning an injury to his arm for several days and wearing a bandage to allow him to carry a concealed dagger, suddenly appeared:

During the attack, Stephanus and Domitian had struggled on the floor, during which time Stephanus was stabbed by the emperor and died shortly afterward.

Domitian's body was carried away on a common <a href="bier">bier</a> and unceremoniously <a href="cremation">cremated</a> by his nurse Phyllis. Later, she took the emperor's ashes to the Flavian Temple and mingled them with those of his niece, Julia. He was 44 years old. As had been foretold, his death came at midday.

Cassius Dio, writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination, suggests that the assassination was improvised, while Suetonius implies it was a well-organized conspiracy, citing Stephanus' feigned injury and claiming that the doors to the servants' quarters had been locked prior to the attack and that a sword Domitian kept concealed beneath his pillow as a last line of personal protection against a would-be assassin, had also been removed beforehand.

Dio included Domitia Longina among the conspirators, but in light of her attested devotion to Domitian—even years after her husband had died—her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely. The precise involvement of the Praetorian Guard is unclear. One of the guard's commanders, <a href="Titus%20Petronius%20Secundus">Titus Petronius Secundus</a>, was almost certainly aware of the plot. The other, Titus Flavius Norbanus, the former governor of <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a>, was a member of Domitian's family.

The "<a href="Fasti%20Ostienses">Fasti Ostienses</a>", the Ostian Calendar, records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor. Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.

According to Cassius Dio, the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination, suggesting that he was at least aware of the plot. He does not appear in Suetonius' version of the events, but this may be understandable, since his works were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian. To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.

On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.

The Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed "damnatio memoriae" on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records. Domitian and, over a century later, <a href="Publius%20Septimius%20Geta">Publius Septimius Geta</a> were the only emperors known to have officially received a "damnatio memoriae", though others may have received "de facto" ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the <a href="Cancelleria%20Reliefs">Cancelleria Reliefs</a>, were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material. Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.

According to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting. As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, <a href="Casperius%20Aelianus">Casperius Aelianus</a>.

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid <a href="siege">siege</a> to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but <a href="abdication">abdicated</a>.

The classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>, Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets <a href="Martial">Martial</a> and <a href="Statius">Statius</a> constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.

The most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> (117–138). His "<a href="De%20Vita%20Caesarum">De Vita Caesarum</a>" is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror. The biography is problematic, however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent <a href="libertine">libertine</a>.

According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of <a href="epigram">epigram</a>matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.

"De Vita Caesarum" is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named <a href="Paris%20%28actor%20under%20Domitian%29">Paris</a>. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed <a href="abortion">abortion</a>.

Modern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.

Although Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work "<a href="Agricola%20%28book%29">Agricola</a>", Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.

Tacitus' major historical works, including "The Histories" and Agricola's biography, were all written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' "Histories" dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in "Agricola" in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.

Other influential 2nd century authors include <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous "Panegyricus Traiani" before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his "<a href="Satires%20of%20Juvenal">Satires</a>", depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the <a href="Acts%20of%20John">Acts of John</a>.

Over the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated. Hostile views of Domitian had been propagated until <a href="archeology">archeological</a> and <a href="numismatics">numismatic</a> advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. It would be nearly a hundred years after <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Gsell">Stéphane Gsell</a>'s 1894 "Essai sur le règne de l'empereur Domitien" however, before any new, book-length studies were published.

The first of these was Jones' 1992 "The Emperor Domitian". He concludes that Domitian was a ruthless but efficient autocrat. For the majority of his reign, there was no widespread dissatisfaction with his policies. His harshness was limited to a highly vocal minority, who exaggerated his despotism in favor of the <a href="Nervan-Antonian%20dynasty">Nervan-Antonian dynasty</a> that followed. His foreign policy was realistic, rejecting expansionist warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest. Persecution of religious minorities, such as Jews and Christians, was non-existent.

In 1930, <a href="Ronald%20Syme">Ronald Syme</a> argued for a complete reassessment of Domitian's financial policy, which had been largely viewed as a disaster. His economic program, which was rigorously efficient, maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve.

Domitian's government nonetheless exhibited <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> characteristics. As Emperor, he saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of Flavian renaissance. Using religious, military and cultural propaganda, he fostered a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a>. He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the Flavian achievements. Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.

He became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from <a href="delatores">informers</a> to bring false charges of treason if necessary.

Despite his vilification by contemporary historians, Domitian's administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from his. Much more than a "gloomy coda to the...1st century", the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign that <a href="Theodor%20Mommsen">Theodor Mommsen</a> described as a somber but intelligent despotism.

Taiko

Taiko have a mythological origin in <a href="Japanese%20folklore">Japanese folklore</a>, but historical records suggest that taiko were introduced to <a href="Japan">Japan</a> through <a href="Korea">Korea</a>n and <a href="China">Chinese</a> cultural influence as early as the 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports the view that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the <a href="Kofun%20period">Kofun period</a>. Their function has varied throughout history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also played a central role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.

"Kumi-daiko" performance, characterized by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of <a href="Daihachi%20Oguchi">Daihachi Oguchi</a> and has continued with groups such as <a href="Kodo%20%28taiko%20group%29">Kodo</a>. Other performance styles, such as "hachijō-daiko", have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. "Kumi-daiko" performance groups are active not only in Japan, but also in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Taiwan, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, <a href="kata">form</a>, <a href="drum%20stick">stick</a> grip, clothing, and the <a href="instrumentation%20%28music%29">particular instrumentation</a>. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped "nagadō-daiko" as well as smaller "<a href="shime-daiko">shime-daiko</a>". Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.

The origin of the instruments is unclear, though there have been many suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588 CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the <a href="Kakko%20%28instrument%29">kakko</a>, a drum that originated in <a href="South%20China">South China</a>. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially <a href="gigaku">gigaku</a> and <a href="gagaku">gagaku</a>, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in <a href="togaku">togaku</a>, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.

Archaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE, during the latter part of the <a href="Kofun%20period">Kofun period</a>, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals. This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of <a href="haniwa">haniwa</a> statues in the <a href="Sawa%20District%2C%20Gunma">Sawa District</a> of <a href="Gunma%20Prefecture">Gunma Prefecture</a>. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums; one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height. This statue is titled "Man Beating the Taiko" and is considered the oldest evidence of taiko performance in Japan. Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this haniwa and known music traditions in Korea and China further suggest influences from these regions.

The "<a href="Nihon%20Shoki">Nihon Shoki</a>", the second oldest book of Japanese classical history, contains a mythological story describing the origin of taiko. The myth tells how <a href="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a>, who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess <a href="Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto">Ame-no-Uzume</a> when others had failed. Ame-no-Uzume accomplished this by emptying out a barrel of <a href="sake">sake</a> and dancing furiously on top of it. Historians regard her performance as the mythological creation of taiko music.

In feudal Japan, taiko were often used to motivate troops, call out orders or announcements, and set a marching pace; marches were usually set to six paces per beat of the drum. During the 16th-century <a href="Sengoku%20period">Warring States period</a>, specific drum calls were used to communicate orders for retreating and advancing. Other rhythms and techniques were detailed in period texts. According to the war chronicle "Gunji Yoshū", nine sets of five beats would summon an ally to battle, while nine sets of three beats, sped up three or four times, was the call to advance and pursue an enemy. Folklore from the 16th century on the legendary 6th-century <a href="Emperor%20Keitai">Emperor Keitai</a> offers a story that he obtained a large drum from China, which he named . The Emperor was thought to have used it to both encourage his own army and intimidate his enemies.

Taiko have been incorporated in Japanese theatre for rhythmic needs, general atmosphere, and in certain settings decoration. In the <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> play "The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles", scenes in the <a href="Y%C5%ABkaku">pleasure quarters</a> are accompanied by taiko to create dramatic tension. <a href="Noh">Noh</a> theatre also feature taiko where performance consists of highly specific rhythmic patterns. The school of drumming, for example, contains 65 basic patterns in addition to 25 special patterns; these patterns are categorized in several classes. Differences between these patterns include changes in <a href="tempo">tempo</a>, <a href="accent%20%28music%29">accent</a>, <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>, <a href="pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a>, and function in the theatrical performance. Patterns are also often connected together in progressions.

Taiko continue to be used in <a href="gagaku">gagaku</a>, a classical music tradition typically performed at the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Tokyo Imperial Palace</a> in addition to local temples and shrines. In gagaku, one component of the art form is traditional dance, which is guided in part by the rhythm set by the taiko. Taiko have played an important role in many local festivals across Japan. They are also used to accompany religious ritual music. In <a href="kagura">kagura</a>, which generically describes music and dances stemming from <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> practices, taiko frequently appear alongside other performers during local festivals. In Buddhist traditions, taiko are used for ritual dances that are a part of the <a href="Bon%20Festival">Bon Festival</a>. Taiko, along with other instruments, are featured atop towers that are adorned with red-and-white cloth and serve to provide rhythms for the dancers who are encircled around the performers.

In addition to the instruments, the term "taiko" also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called "kumi-daiko", or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). "Kumi-daiko" was developed by <a href="Daihachi%20Oguchi">Daihachi Oguchi</a> in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in <a href="Nagano%20Prefecture">Nagano</a>, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in "kumi-daiko" performance.

Oguchi's ensemble, <a href="Osuwa%20Daiko">Osuwa Daiko</a>, incorporated these alterations and other drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances. Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. <a href="Oedo%20Sukeroku%20Daiko">Oedo Sukeroku Daiko</a> was formed in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in 1959 under <a href="Seid%C5%8D%20Kobayashi">Seidō Kobayashi</a>, and has been referred to as the first taiko group who toured professionally. Globally, "kumi-daiko" performance became more visible during the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Summer Olympics</a> in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.

"Kumi-daiko" was also developed through the leadership of , who gathered young men who were willing to devote their entire lifestyle to taiko playing and took them to <a href="Sado%20Island">Sado Island</a> for training where Den and his family had settled in 1968. Den chose the island based on a desire to reinvigorate the folk arts in Japan, particularly taiko; he became inspired by a drumming tradition unique to Sado called that required considerable strength to play well. Den called the group "Za Ondekoza" or <a href="Ondekoza">Ondekoza</a> for short, and implemented a rigorous set of exercises for its members including long-distance running. In 1975, Ondekoza was the first taiko group to tour in the United States. Their first performance occurred just after the group finished running the <a href="Boston%20Marathon">Boston Marathon</a> while wearing their traditional uniforms. In 1981, some members of Ondekoza split from Den and formed another group called <a href="Kodo%20%28taiko%20group%29">Kodo</a> under the leadership of <a href="Eitetsu%20Hayashi">Eitetsu Hayashi</a>. Kodo continued to use Sado Island for rigorous training and communal living, and went on to popularize taiko through frequent touring and collaborations with other musical performers. Kodo is one of the most recognized taiko groups both in Japan and worldwide.

Estimates of the number of taiko groups in Japan vary up to 5000 active in Japan, but more conservative assessments place the number closer to 800 based on membership in the Nippon Taiko Foundation, the largest national organization of taiko groups. Some pieces that have emerged from early "kumi-daiko" groups that continue to be performed include "<a href="Yatai-bayashi">Yatai-bayashi</a>" from Ondekoza, from Osuwa Daiko, and from Kodo.

Taiko have been developed into a broad range of <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion instrument</a>s that are used in both <a href="Music%20of%20Japan">Japanese folk and classical</a> musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by <a href="Francis%20Taylor%20Piggott">Francis Taylor Piggott</a> in 1909. Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used, but some are not classified, such as the toy <a href="den-den%20daiko">den-den daiko</a>.

With few exceptions, taiko have a drum shell with heads on both sides of the body, and a sealed resonating cavity. The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes. Taiko may be either tunable or non-tunable depending on the system used.

Taiko are categorized into three types based on construction process. "Byō-uchi-daiko" are constructed with the <a href="drumhead">drumhead</a> nailed to the body. "<a href="Shime-daiko">Shime-daiko</a>" are classically constructed with the skin placed over iron or steel rings, which are then tightened with ropes. Contemporary "shime-daiko" are tensioned using <a href="Screw">bolts</a> or <a href="turnbuckle">turnbuckle</a>s systems attached to the drum body. "Tsuzumi" are also rope-tensioned drums, but have a distinct hourglass shape and their skins are made using deerskin.

"Byō-uchi-daiko" were historically made only using a single piece of wood; they continue to be made in this manner, but are also constructed from staves of wood. Larger drums can be made using a single piece of wood, but at a much greater cost due to the difficulty in finding appropriate trees. The preferred wood is the <a href="Zelkova%20serrata">Japanese zelkova</a> or "keyaki", but a number of other woods, and even <a href="wine%20barrel">wine barrel</a>s, have been used to create taiko. "Byō-uchi-daiko" cannot be tuned.

The typical "byō-uchi-daiko" is the "nagadō-daiko", an elongated drum that is roughly shaped like a wine barrel. "Nagadō-daiko" are available in a variety of sizes, and their head diameter is traditionally measured in <a href="shaku%20%28unit%29">shaku</a> (units of roughly 30 cm). Head diameters range from . are the smallest of these drums and are usually about in diameter. The "chū-daiko " is a medium-sized "nagadō-daiko" ranging from , and weighing about . vary in size, and are often as large as in diameter. Some "ō-daiko" are difficult to move due to their size, and therefore permanently remain inside the performance space, such as temple or shrine. "Ō-daiko" means "large drum" and for a given ensemble, the term refers to their largest drum. The other type of "byō-uchi-daiko" is called a and describes any drum constructed such that the head diameter is greater than the length of the body.

"Shime-daiko" are a set of smaller, roughly <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>-sized instrument that are tunable. The tensioning system usually consists of hemp cords or rope, but bolt or turnbuckle systems have been used as well. , sometimes referred to as "taiko" in the context of theater, have thinner heads than other kinds of shime-daiko. The head includes a patch of deerskin placed in the center, and in performance, drum strokes are generally restricted to this area. The is a heavier type of "shime-daiko". They are available in sizes 1–5, and are named according to their number: "namitsuke" (1), "nichō-gakke" (2), "sanchō-gakke" (3), "yonchō-gakke" (4), and "gochō-gakke" (5). The "namitsuke" has the thinnest skins and the shortest body in terms of height; thickness and tension of skins, as well as body height, increase toward the "gochō-gakke". The head diameters of all "shime-daiko" sizes are around .

"Okedō-daiko" or simply "okedō", are a type of "shime-daiko" that are stave-constructed using narrower strips of wood, have a tube-shaped frame. Like other "shime-daiko", drum heads are attached by metal hoops and fastened by rope or cords. "Okedō" can be played using the same drumsticks (called "bachi") as "shime-daiko", but can also be hand-played. "Okedō" come in short- and long-bodied types.

"Tsuzumi" are a class of hourglass-shaped drums. The drum body is shaped on a spool and the inner body carved by hand. Their skins can be made from cowhide, horsehide, or deerskin. While the "ō-tsuzumi" skins are made from cowhide, "ko-tsuzumi" are made from horsehide. While some classify "tsuzumi" as a type of taiko, others have described them as a drum entirely separate from taiko.

Taiko can also be categorized by the context in which they are used. The "miya-daiko", for instance, is constructed in the same manner as other "byō-uchi-daiko", but is distinguished by an ornamental stand and is used for ceremonial purposes at <a href="Buddhist%20temples%20in%20Japan">Buddhist temples</a>. The (a "ko-daiko") and (a "nagadō-daiko" with a cigar-shaped body) are used in <a href="sumo">sumo</a> and festivals respectively.
Several drums, categorized as "gagakki", are used in the Japanese theatrical form, <a href="gagaku">gagaku</a>. The lead instrument of the ensemble is the <a href="kakko%20%28instrument%29">kakko</a>, which is a smaller "shime-daiko" with heads made of deerskin, and is placed horizontally on a stand during performance. A "tsuzumi", called the "san-no-tsuzumi" is another small drum in gagaku that is placed horizontally and struck with a thin stick. are the largest drums of the ensemble, and have heads that are about in diameter. During performance, the drum is placed on a tall pedestals and surrounded by a rim decoratively painted with flames and adorned with mystical figures such as <a href="wyverns">wyverns</a>. "Dadaiko" are played while standing, and are usually only played on the <a href="Beat%20%28music%29%23Downbeat">downbeat</a> of the music. The is a smaller drum that produces a lower sound, its head measuring about in diameter. It is used in ensembles that accompany <a href="bugaku">bugaku</a>, a traditional dance performed at the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Tokyo Imperial Palace</a> and in religious contexts. "Tsuri-daiko" are suspended on a small stand, and are played sitting down. "Tsuri-daiko" performers typically use shorter mallets covered in leather knobs instead of <a href="bachi">bachi</a>. They can be played simultaneously by two performers; while one performer plays on the head, another performer uses bachi on the body of the drum.

The larger "ō-tsuzumi" and smaller "ko-tsuzumi" are used in the opening and dances of <a href="Noh%20theater">Noh theater</a>. Both drums are struck using the fingers; players can also adjust pitch by manually applying pressure to the ropes on the drum. The color of the cords of these drums also indicates the skill of the musician: Orange and red for amateur players, light blue for performers with expertise, and <a href="lilac%20%28color%29">lilac</a> for masters of the instrument. "Nagauta-shime daiko" or "uta daiko" are also featured in Noh performance.

Many taiko in Noh are also featured in <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> performance and are used in a similar manner. In addition to the "ō-tsuzumi", "ko-tsuzumi", and "nagauta-shime daiko", Kabuki performances make use of the larger "ō-daiko" offstage to help set the atmosphere for different scenes.

Taiko construction has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning the skin to the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, "byō-uchi-daiko" were crafted from <a href="trunk%20%28botany%29">trunks</a> of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent <a href="wood%20splitting">splitting</a>. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; the texture of the wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large <a href="lathe">lathe</a> using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.
The <a href="drum%20skin">skins</a> or heads of taiko are generally made from <a href="cowhide">cowhide</a> from <a href="Holstein%20cattle">Holstein cows</a> aged about three or four years. Skins also come from <a href="horse">horse</a>s, and <a href="bull">bull</a> skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several <a href="hydraulic%20jack">hydraulic jack</a>s underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden <a href="dowel">dowel</a>s or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called "byō", are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; "chū-daiko" require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.

Several companies specialize in the production of taiko. One such company that created drums exclusively for the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor of Japan</a>, <a href="Miyamoto%20Unosuke%20Shoten">Miyamoto Unosuke Shoten</a> in Tokyo, has been making taiko since 1861. The <a href="Asano%20Taiko%20Corporation">Asano Taiko Corporation</a> is another major taiko-producing organization, and has been producing taiko for over 400 years. The family-owned business started in <a href="Matt%C5%8D%2C%20Ishikawa">Mattō, Ishikawa</a>, and, aside from military equipment, made taiko for Noh theater and later expanded to creating instruments for festivals during the <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a>. Asano currently maintains an entire complex of large buildings referred to as Asano Taiko Village, and the company reports producing up to 8000 drums each year. As of 2012, there is approximately one major taiko production company in <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">each prefecture of Japan</a>, with some regions having several companies. Of the manufacturers in Naniwa, Taikoya Matabē is one of the most successful and is thought to have brought considerable recognition to the community and attracted many drum makers there. Umetsu Daiko, a company that operates in <a href="Hakata-ku%2C%20Fukuoka">Hakata</a>, has been producing taiko since 1821.

Taiko performance styles vary widely across groups in terms of the number of performers, repertoire, instrument choices, and stage techniques. Nevertheless, a number of early groups have had broad influence on the tradition. For instance, many pieces developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.

<a href="Kata">Kata</a> is a term used to describe the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the <a href="hara%20%28tanden%29">hara</a> is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.

Some groups in Japan, particularly those active in Tokyo, also emphasize the importance of the lively and spirited "<a href="Iki%20%28aesthetics%29">iki</a>" aesthetic. In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> (1603–1868).
The sticks for playing taiko are called "bachi", and are made in various sizes and from different kinds of wood such as <a href="Quercus%20alba">white oak</a>, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>, and <a href="Japanese%20magnolia">Japanese magnolia</a>. "Bachi" are also held in a number of different styles. In "kumi-daiko", it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player. There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the "shime" grip, which is similar to a <a href="matched%20grip">matched grip</a>: the "bachi" are gripped at the back end, and the <a href="fulcrum%20%28drumming%29">fulcrum</a> rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.

Performance in some groups is also guided by principles based on <a href="Zen%20Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a>. For instance, among other concepts, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Taiko%20Dojo">San Francisco Taiko Dojo</a> is guided by emphasizing communication, respect, and harmony. The way the "bachi" are held can also be significant; for some groups, "bachi" represent a spiritual link between the body and the sky. Some physical parts of taiko, like the drum body, its skin, and the tacks also hold symbolic significance in Buddhism.

"Kumi-daiko" groups consist primarily of percussive instruments where each of the drums plays a specific role. Of the different kinds of taiko, the most common in groups is the "nagadō-daiko". "Chū-daiko" are common in taiko groups and represent the main rhythm of the group, whereas "shime-daiko" set and change tempo. "Ō-daiko" provide a steady, underlying pulse and serve as a counter-rhythm to the other parts. It is common for performances to begin with a <a href="single%20stroke%20roll">single stroke roll</a> called an "". The player starts slowly, leaving considerable space between strikes, gradually shortening the interval between hits, until the drummer is playing a rapid roll of hits. Oroshi are also played as a part of theatrical performance, such as in Noh theater.

Drums are not the only instruments played in the ensemble; other Japanese instruments are also used. Other kinds of percussion instruments include the , a hand-sized gong played with a small mallet. In kabuki, the <a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>, a <a href="plucked%20string%20instrument">plucked string instrument</a>, often accompanies taiko during the theatrical performance. "Kumi-daiko" performances can also feature woodwinds such as the <a href="shakuhachi">shakuhachi</a> and the <a href="shinobue">shinobue</a>.

Voiced calls or shouts called <a href="kakegoe">kakegoe</a> and <a href="kiai">kiai</a> are also common in taiko performance. They are used as encouragement to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo. In contrast, the philosophical concept of <a href="Ma%20%28negative%20space%29">ma</a>, which superficially describes the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.

There is a wide variety of traditional clothing that players wear during taiko performance. Common in many "kumi-daiko" groups is the use of the <a href="happi">happi</a>, a decorative, thin-fabric coat, and traditional headbands called <a href="hachimaki">hachimaki</a>. <a href="Tabi">Tabi</a>, , and are also typical. During his time with the group Ondekoza, Eitetsu Hayashi suggested that a loincloth called a <a href="fundoshi">fundoshi</a> be worn when performing for French fashion designer <a href="Pierre%20Cardin">Pierre Cardin</a>, who saw Ondekoza perform for him in 1975. The Japanese group Kodo has sometimes worn fundoshi for its performances.

Taiko performance is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, such as in the 1512 encyclopedia called the "<a href="Taigensho">Taigensho</a>", but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist William P. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.

Orally, patterns of <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a> called <a href="kuchi%20sh%C5%8Dga">kuchi shōga</a> are taught from teacher to student that convey the rhythm and <a href="timbre">timbre</a> of drum strikes for a particular piece. For example, represents a single strike to the center of the drum, where as represents two successive strikes, first by the right and then the left, and lasts the same amount of time as one "don" strike. Some taiko pieces, such as "<a href="Yatai-bayashi">Yatai-bayashi</a>", include patterns that are difficult to represent in <a href="List%20of%20musical%20symbols">Western musical notation</a>. The exact words used can also differ from region to region.

More recently, Japanese publications have emerged in an attempt to standardize taiko performance. The <a href="Nippon%20Taiko%20Foundation">Nippon Taiko Foundation</a> was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote "Japan Taiko" with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in "kumi-daiko" performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.

The system of fundamentals "Japan Taiko" put forward was not widely adopted because taiko performance varied substantially across Japan. An updated 2001 publication from the Foundation, called the , describes regional variations that depart from the main techniques taught in the textbook. The creators of the text maintained that mastering a set of prescribed basics should be compatible with learning local traditions.

Aside from "kumi-daiko" performance, a number of folk traditions that use taiko have been recognized in different regions in Japan. Some of these include from <a href="Sado%2C%20Niigata">Sado Island</a>, ' from the town of <a href="Kokura">Kokura</a>, and ' from <a href="Iwate%20Prefecture">Iwate Prefecture</a>.

A variety of folk dances originating from <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, known collectively as <a href="Eisa%20%28dance%29">eisa</a>, often make use of the taiko. Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles: groups on the <a href="Uruma%2C%20Okinawa%23Yokatsu%20Islands">Yokatsu Peninsula</a> and on Hamahiga Island use small, single-sided drums called whereas groups near <a href="Okinawa%2C%20Okinawa">the city of Okinawa</a> generally use "shime-daiko". Use of "shime-daiko" over "pāranku" has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style. Small "nagadō-daiko", referred to as "ō-daiko" within the tradition, are also used and are worn in front of the performer. These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and large cities on the <a href="Honshu">Japanese mainland</a>.

 is a taiko tradition originating on the island of <a href="Hachij%C5%8D-jima">Hachijō-jima</a>. Two styles of "Hachijō-daiko" emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.

The "Hachijō-daiko" tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named <a href="Kakuso%20Kizan">Kakuso Kizan</a>. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as "a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of "Hachijō-daiko". These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one.
The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called "Kumaoji-daiko", named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. "Kumaoji-daiko" has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. "Kumaoji-daiko" also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.

The contemporary style of "Hachijō-daiko" is called , which differs from "Kumaoji-daiko" in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, "shin-daiko" performances use larger drums exclusively on stands. "Shin-daiko" emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood. Looser clothing is worn by "shin-daiko" performers compared to <a href="kimono">kimono</a> worn by "Kumaoji-daiko" performers; the looser clothing in "shin-daiko" allow performers to adopt more open stances and larger movements with the legs and arms. Rhythms used for the accompanying "shita-byōshi" role can also differ. One type of rhythm, called "yūkichi", consists of the following: 

This rhythm is found in both styles, but is always played faster in "shin-daiko". Another type of rhythm, called "honbadaki", is unique to "shin-daiko" and also contains a song which is performed in standard Japanese.

 is a style that has spread amongst groups through Kodo, and is formally known as . The word "miyake" comes from <a href="Miyake-jima">Miyake-jima</a>, part of the <a href="Izu%20Islands">Izu Islands</a>, and the word "Kamitsuki" refers to the village where the tradition came from. Miyake-style taiko came out of performances for — a traditional festival held annually in July on Miyake Island since 1820 honoring the deity <a href="Gozu%20Tenn%C5%8D">Gozu Tennō</a>. In this festival, players perform on taiko while <a href="portable%20shrine">portable shrine</a>s are carried around town. The style itself is characterized in a number of ways. A "nagadō-daiko" is typically set low to the ground and played by two performers, one on each side; instead of sitting, performers stand and hold a stance that is also very low to the ground, almost to the point of kneeling.

Taiko groups in Australia began forming in the 1990s. The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, was formed in 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei. <a href="TaikOz">TaikOz</a> was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and <a href="Riley%20Lee">Riley Lee</a>, a former Ondekoza member, and has been performing in Australia since 1997. They are known for their work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes, and have a strong fan base. Cleworth and other members of the group have developed several original pieces.

The introduction of "kumi-daiko" performance in Brazil can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s in São Paulo. <a href="Tangue%20Setsuko">Tangue Setsuko</a> founded an eponymous taiko dojo and was Brazil's first taiko group; <a href="Setsuo%20Kinoshita">Setsuo Kinoshita</a> later formed the group Wadaiko Sho. Brazilian groups have combined native and <a href="Rhythm%20in%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa">African drumming techniques</a> with taiko performance. One such piece developed by Kinoshita is called "Taiko de Samba", which emphasizes both Brazilian and Japanese aesthetics in percussion traditions. Taiko was also popularized in Brazil from 2002 through the work of Yukihisa Oda, a Japanese native who visited Brazil several times through the <a href="Japan%20International%20Cooperation%20Agency">Japan International Cooperation Agency</a>.

The Brazilian Association of Taiko (ABT) suggests that there are about 150 taiko groups in Brazil and that about 10–15% of players are non-Japanese; Izumo Honda, coordinator of a large annual festival in São Paulo, estimated that about 60% of all taiko performers in Brazil are women.

Taiko emerged in the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, <a href="San%20Francisco%20Taiko%20Dojo">San Francisco Taiko Dojo</a>, was formed in 1968 by <a href="Seiichi%20Tanaka">Seiichi Tanaka</a>, a postwar immigrant who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, a few members of <a href="Senshin%20Buddhist%20Temple">Senshin Buddhist Temple</a> in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called <a href="Kinnara%20Taiko">Kinnara Taiko</a>. <a href="San%20Jose%20Taiko">San Jose Taiko</a> later formed in 1973 in <a href="Japantown%2C%20San%20Jose">Japantown, San Jose</a>, under <a href="Roy%20Hirabayashi">Roy</a> and <a href="PJ%20Hirabayashi">PJ Hirabayashi</a>. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of <a href="Denver%20Taiko">Denver Taiko</a> in 1976 and <a href="Soh%20Daiko">Soh Daiko</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.

Japanese-Canadian taiko began in 1979 with Katari Taiko, and was inspired by the San Jose Taiko group. Its early membership was predominantly female. Katari Taiko and future groups were thought to represent an opportunity for younger, third-generation <a href="Japanese%20Canadians">Japanese Canadians</a> to explore their roots, redevelop a sense of ethnic community, and expand taiko into other musical traditions.

There are no official counts or estimates of the number of active taiko groups in the United States or Canada, as there is no governing body for taiko groups in either country. Unofficial estimates have been made. In 1989, there were as many as 30 groups in the US and Canada, seven of which were in <a href="California">California</a>. One estimate suggested that around 120 groups were active in the US and Canada as of 2001, many of which could be traced to the San Francisco Taiko Dojo; later estimates in 2005 and 2006 suggested there were about 200 groups in the United States alone.

The <a href="Cirque%20du%20Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> shows "<a href="Myst%C3%A8re%20%28Cirque%20du%20Soleil%29">Mystère</a>" in Las Vegas and "<a href="Dralion">Dralion</a>" have featured taiko performance. Taiko performance has also been featured in commercial productions such as the 2005 <a href="Mitsubishi%20Eclipse">Mitsubishi Eclipse</a> ad campaign, and in events such as the 2009 <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> and 2011 <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s.

From 2005 to 2006, the <a href="Japanese%20American%20National%20Museum">Japanese American National Museum</a> held an exhibition called "Big Drum: Taiko in the United States". The exhibition covered several topics related to taiko in the United States, such as the formation of performance groups, their construction using available materials, and social movements. Visitors were able to play smaller drums.

Certain peoples have used taiko to advance social or cultural movements, both within Japan and elsewhere in the world.

Taiko performance has frequently been viewed as an art form dominated by men. Historians of taiko argue that its performance comes from masculine traditions. Those who developed ensemble-style taiko in Japan were men, and through the influence of Ondekoza, the ideal taiko player was epitomized in images of the masculine peasant class, particularly through the character Muhōmatsu in the 1958 film "<a href="Rickshaw%20Man">Rickshaw Man</a>". Masculine roots have also been attributed to perceived capacity for "spectacular bodily performance" where women's bodies are sometimes judged as unable to meet the physical demands of playing.

Before the 1980s, it was uncommon for Japanese women to perform on traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted; an exception was the San Francisco Taiko Dojo under the guidance of Grand master Seiichi Tanaka, who was the first to admit females to the art form. In Ondekoza and in the early performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances. Thereafter, female participation in "kumi-daiko" started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play "as women". Other women in the apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.

Female taiko performance has also served as a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>. Through performance, some groups believe they are helping to redefine not only the role of women in taiko, but how women are perceived more generally.

Those involved in the construction of taiko are usually considered part of the <a href="burakumin">burakumin</a>, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the <a href="Tokugawa%20period">Tokugawa period</a> in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the <a href="Burakumin%23Social%20discrimination">burakumin have continued to face social discrimination</a>, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.

The , representing the contributions of burakumin, is found in <a href="Naniwa-ku%2C%20Osaka">Naniwa Ward</a> in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>, home to a large proportion of burakumin. Among other features, the road contains taiko-shaped benches representing their traditions in taiko manufacturing and leatherworking, and their influence on national culture. The road ends at the <a href="Osaka%20Human%20Rights%20Museum">Osaka Human Rights Museum</a>, which exhibits the history of systematic discrimination against the burakumin. The road and museum were developed in part due an advocacy campaign led by the <a href="Buraku%20Liberation%20League">Buraku Liberation League</a> and a taiko group of younger performers called .

Taiko performance was an important part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called "<a href="sansei">sansei</a>". During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, second-generation Japanese residents, called "<a href="nisei">nisei</a>" faced <a href="Internment%20of%20Japanese%20Americans">internment in the United States</a> and <a href="Japanese%20Canadian%20internment">in Canada</a> on the basis of their race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as <a href="San%20Jose%20Taiko">San Jose Taiko</a> were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, performance was meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.

A number of performers and groups, including several early leaders, have been recognized for their contributions to taiko performance. <a href="Daihachi%20Oguchi">Daihachi Oguchi</a> was best known for developing "kumi-daiko" performance. Oguchi founded the first "kumi-daiko" group called <a href="Osuwa%20Daiko">Osuwa Daiko</a> in 1951, and facilitated the popularization of taiko performance groups in Japan.

<a href="Seid%C5%8D%20Kobayashi">Seidō Kobayashi</a> is the leader of the Tokyo-based taiko group <a href="Oedo%20Sukeroku%20Taiko">Oedo Sukeroku Taiko</a> as of December 2014. Kobayashi founded the group in 1959 and was the first group to tour professionally. Kobayashi is considered a master performer of taiko. He is also known for asserting intellectual control of the group's performance style, which has influenced performance for many groups, particularly in North America.

In 1968, <a href="Seiichi%20Tanaka">Seiichi Tanaka</a> founded the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Taiko%20Dojo">San Francisco Taiko Dojo</a> and is regarded as the Grandfather of Taiko and primary developer of taiko performance in the United States. He was a recipient of a 2001 <a href="National%20Heritage%20Fellowship">National Heritage Fellowship</a> awarded by the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a> and since 2013 is the only taiko professional presented with the Order of the Rising Sun 5th Order: Gold and Silver Rays by Emperor Akihito of Japan, in recognition of Grandmaster Seiichi Tanaka's contributions to the fostering of US-Japan relations as well as the promotion of Japanese cultural understanding in the United States.

In 1969, founded <a href="Ondekoza">Ondekoza</a>, a group well known for making taiko performance internationally visible and for its artistic contributions to the tradition. Den was also known for developing a communal living and training facility for Ondekoza on Sado Island in Japan, which had a reputation for its intensity and broad education programs in folklore and music.

Performers and groups beyond the early practitioners have also been noted. <a href="Eitetsu%20Hayashi">Eitetsu Hayashi</a> is best known for his solo performance work. Hayashi joined Ondekoza when he was 19, and after parting from the group helped found <a href="Kodo%20%28taiko%20group%29">Kodo</a>, one of the best known and most influential taiko performance groups in the world. Hayashi soon left the group to begin a solo career and has performed in venues such as <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in 1984, the first featured taiko performer there. He was awarded the 47th Education Minister's Art Encouragement Prize, a national award, in 1997 as well as the 8th Award for the Promotion of Traditional Japanese Culture from the <a href="Japan%20Arts%20Foundation">Japan Arts Foundation</a> in 2001.

David Bowie

David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie (), was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a>. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">world's best-selling music artists</a>. In the UK, he was awarded ten <a href="Music%20recording%20certification">platinum</a> album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released <a href="List%20of%20artists%20by%20number%20of%20UK%20Albums%20Chart%20number%20ones">eleven number-one albums</a>. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1996.

Born in <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a>, <a href="South%20London">South London</a>, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. "<a href="Space%20Oddity">Space Oddity</a>" became his first top-five entry on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> era with his flamboyant and androgynous <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a> Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single "<a href="Starman%20%28song%29">Starman</a>" and album "<a href="The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20Ziggy%20Stardust%20and%20the%20Spiders%20from%20Mars">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as "<a href="plastic%20soul">plastic soul</a>", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "<a href="Fame%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Fame</a>" and the album "<a href="Young%20Americans">Young Americans</a>". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>", directed by <a href="Nicolas%20Roeg">Nicolas Roeg</a>, and released "<a href="Station%20to%20Station">Station to Station</a>". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a>-inflected album "<a href="Low%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Low</a>" (1977), the first of three collaborations with <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> that came to be known as the "<a href="Berlin%20Trilogy">Berlin Trilogy</a>". "<a href="%26quot%3BHeroes%26quot%3B%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">"Heroes"</a>" (1977) and "<a href="Lodger%20%28album%29">Lodger</a>" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.

After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single "<a href="Ashes%20to%20Ashes%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Ashes to Ashes</a>", its parent album "<a href="Scary%20Monsters%20%28and%20Super%20Creeps%29">Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</a>", and "<a href="Under%20Pressure">Under Pressure</a>", a 1981 collaboration with <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with "<a href="Let%27s%20Dance%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Let's Dance</a>"; the album's <a href="Let%27s%20Dance%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">title track</a> topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> and <a href="oldschool%20jungle">jungle</a>. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in "<a href="Merry%20Christmas%2C%20Mr.%20Lawrence">Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</a>" (1983), <a href="Jareth">Jareth</a> the Goblin King in "<a href="Labyrinth%20%28film%29">Labyrinth</a>" (1986), <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> in "<a href="The%20Last%20Temptation%20of%20Christ%20%28film%29">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>" (1988), and <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> in "<a href="The%20Prestige%20%28film%29">The Prestige</a>" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with "<a href="The%20Next%20Day">The Next Day</a>." He remained musically active until he <a href="Death%20of%20David%20Bowie">died of liver cancer</a> two days after the release of his final album, "<a href="Blackstar%20%28album%29">Blackstar</a>" (2016).

Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a>, London. His mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns; 1913–2001), was born at <a href="Shorncliffe%20Army%20Camp">Shorncliffe Army Camp</a> near <a href="Cheriton%2C%20Kent">Cheriton</a>, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in <a href="Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Royal Tunbridge Wells</a>. His father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones (1912–1969), was from <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity <a href="Barnardo%27s">Barnardo's</a>. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and <a href="Stockwell">Stockwell</a> in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended <a href="Stockwell%20Primary%20School">Stockwell Infants School</a> until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.

In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to <a href="Bromley">Bromley</a>. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the <a href="Recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorder</a>. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American <a href="Gramophone%20record">45s</a> by artists including <a href="the%20Teenagers">the Teenagers</a>, <a href="the%20Platters">the Platters</a>, <a href="Fats%20Domino">Fats Domino</a>, <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, and <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>. Upon listening to Little Richard's song "<a href="Tutti%20Frutti%20%28song%29">Tutti Frutti</a>", Bowie would later say that he had "heard God".

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to "<a href="Hound%20Dog%20%28song%29">Hound Dog</a>". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> and <a href="tea-chest%20bass">tea-chest bass</a>, begun to participate in <a href="skiffle">skiffle</a> sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a>—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local <a href="Cub%20Scout">Wolf Cub</a> group was described as "mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet". After taking his <a href="eleven-plus">eleven-plus</a> exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to <a href="Ravens%20Wood%20School">Bromley Technical High School</a>.

It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:

Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After his half-brother Terry Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like <a href="Charles%20Mingus">Charles Mingus</a> and <a href="John%20Coltrane">John Coltrane</a> led his mother to give him a <a href="Grafton%20saxophone">Grafton saxophone</a> in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from <a href="baritone%20saxophone">baritone saxophonist</a> <a href="Ronnie%20Ross">Ronnie Ross</a>. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend <a href="George%20Underwood%20%28artist%29">George Underwood</a> punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty <a href="depth%20perception">depth perception</a> and a <a href="anisocoria">permanently dilated pupil</a>, which gave a false impression of a <a href="Heterochromia%20iridum">change in the iris's colour</a>; the eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.

In 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15, named the Konrads. Playing guitar-based <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them. When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur <a href="John%20Bloom%20%28businessman%29">John Bloom</a> inviting him to "do for us what <a href="Brian%20Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> has done for <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>—and make another million." Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to <a href="Dick%20James">Dick James</a>'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, "<a href="Liza%20Jane%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Liza Jane</a>", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of <a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a> and <a href="Willie%20Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—"I used to dream of being their <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>", Bowie was to recall. Their cover of <a href="Bobby%20Bland">Bobby Bland</a>'s "<a href="I%20Pity%20the%20Fool">I Pity the Fool</a>" was no more successful than "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>. "<a href="You%27ve%20Got%20a%20Habit%20of%20Leaving">You've Got a Habit of Leaving</a>" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world "to study mime at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells</a>", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, "<a href="Do%20Anything%20You%20Say">Do Anything You Say</a>". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the <a href="The%20Riot%20Squad">Riot Squad</a>; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a>, went unreleased. Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.

Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with <a href="Davy%20Jones%20%28musician%29">Davy Jones</a> of <a href="The%20Monkees">The Monkees</a>, Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American pioneer <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a> and <a href="Bowie%20knife">the knife he had popularised</a>. His April 1967 solo single, "<a href="The%20Laughing%20Gnome">The Laughing Gnome</a>", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, "<a href="David%20Bowie%20%281967%20album%29">David Bowie</a>", an amalgam of pop, <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelia</a>, and <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>, met the same fate. It was his last release for two years.

Bowie met dancer <a href="Lindsay%20Kemp">Lindsay Kemp</a> in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image "really blossomed". "He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus." Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> theatre and <a href="mime%20artist">mime</a> to <a href="commedia%20dell%27arte">commedia dell'arte</a>, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie composition "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for <a href="Paul%20Nicholas">Oscar</a>; another Bowie song, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by <a href="Billy%20Fury">Billy Fury</a> the following year. In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> play, "The Pistol Shot", in the <a href="Theatre%20625">Theatre 625</a> series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, <a href="Beat%20music">Merseybeat</a>, poetry, and mime. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, "<a href="Song%20of%20Norway%20%28film%29">Song of Norway</a>"; this affected him, and several songs, such as "<a href="Letter%20to%20Hermione">Letter to Hermione</a>" and "<a href="Life%20on%20Mars%20%28song%29">Life on Mars?</a>" reference her, and for the video accompanying "<a href="Where%20Are%20We%20Now%3F">Where Are We Now?</a>", he wore a T-shirt with the words "m/s Song of Norway". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of "<a href="Love%20You%20till%20Tuesday%20%28film%29">Love You till Tuesday</a>", a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including "<a href="Space%20Oddity">Space Oddity</a>", which had not been released when the film was made.

After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. During this period he appeared in a <a href="Lyons%20Maid">Lyons Maid</a> ice cream commercial, and was rejected for another by <a href="Kit%20Kat">Kit Kat</a>. In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a>'s duo <a href="T.%20Rex%20%28band%29">Tyrannosaurus Rex</a>, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. On 11 July 1969, "Space Oddity" was released five days ahead of the <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> launch, and reached the top five in the UK. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in <a href="Beckenham">Beckenham</a> High Street. The club was influenced by the <a href="Arts%20Lab">Arts Lab</a> movement, developing into the <a href="Beckenham%20Arts%20Lab">Beckenham Arts Lab</a> and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song "<a href="Memory%20of%20a%20Free%20Festival">Memory of a Free Festival</a>". 

Bowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as "<a href="David%20Bowie%20%281969%20album%29">David Bowie</a>", it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled "Man of Words/Man of Music"; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a> as "Space Oddity". Featuring philosophical post-<a href="hippie">hippie</a> lyrics on peace, love, and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.

Bowie met <a href="Angie%20Bowie">Angela Barnett</a> in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for gigs and recording—people he could relate to personally". The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a>, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist. The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, <a href="Tony%20Visconti">Tony Visconti</a> on bass and <a href="Mick%20Ronson">Mick Ronson</a> on electric guitar. Known as <a href="Hype%20%28David%20Bowie%20band%29">Hype</a>, the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the <a href="Roundhouse%20%28venue%29">London Roundhouse</a>, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style. Matters came to a head when an enraged Bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance, exclaiming "You're fucking up my album." Cambridge left and was replaced by <a href="Mick%20Woodmansey">Mick Woodmansey</a>. Not long after, the singer fired his manager and replaced him with <a href="Tony%20Defries">Tony Defries</a>. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.

The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Sold%20the%20World%20%28album%29">The Man Who Sold the World</a>" (1970), which contained references to <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, paranoia, and delusion. Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new <a href="Backup%20band">backing band</a>, it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by "Space Oddity". To promote it in the US, <a href="Mercury%20Records">Mercury Records</a> financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across America in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media. Exploiting his <a href="androgyny">androgynous</a> appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews—to the approval of critics, including "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="John%20Mendelsohn%20%28musician%29">John Mendelsohn</a> who described him as "ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>" – and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to "kiss my ass".

During the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American <a href="proto-punk">proto-punk</a> artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a> with the music of <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a>, producing "the ultimate pop idol". A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars". The "Stardust" surname was a tribute to the "<a href="Legendary%20Stardust%20Cowboy">Legendary Stardust Cowboy</a>", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie would later cover "I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship" on 2002's "<a href="Heathen%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Heathen</a>".

"<a href="Hunky%20Dory">Hunky Dory</a>" (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles by <a href="Ken%20Scott">Ken Scott</a> and <a href="Trevor%20Bolder">Trevor Bolder</a> respectively. The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of "Space Oddity", with light fare such as "<a href="Kooks%20%28song%29">Kooks</a>", a song written for his son, <a href="Duncan%20Jones">Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones</a>, born on 30 May. (His parents chose "his kooky name"—he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years—after the Greek word "zoe", life.) Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with "<a href="Song%20for%20Bob%20Dylan">Song for Bob Dylan</a>", "<a href="Andy%20Warhol%20%28song%29">Andy Warhol</a>", and "<a href="Queen%20Bitch">Queen Bitch</a>", a <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">Velvet Underground</a> pastiche. It was not a significant commercial success at the time.

Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with <a href="the%20Spiders%20from%20Mars">the Spiders from Mars</a>—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in <a href="Tolworth">Tolworth</a> in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston upon Thames</a> on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom." "<a href="The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20Ziggy%20Stardust%20and%20the%20Spiders%20from%20Mars">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>" (1972), combining the hard rock elements of "The Man Who Sold the World" with the lighter experimental rock and pop of "Hunky Dory", was released in June. "<a href="Starman%20%28song%29">Starman</a>", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the 6-month-old "Hunky Dory". At the same time the non-album single "<a href="John%2C%20I%27m%20Only%20Dancing">John, I'm Only Dancing</a>", and "<a href="All%20the%20Young%20Dudes">All the Young Dudes</a>", a song he wrote and produced for <a href="Mott%20the%20Hoople">Mott the Hoople</a>, were successful in the UK. The <a href="Ziggy%20Stardust%20Tour">Ziggy Stardust Tour</a> continued to the United States.

Bowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards, and guitar to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough "<a href="Transformer%20%28album%29">Transformer</a>", co-producing the album with Mick Ronson. The following year, Bowie co-produced and <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> <a href="The%20Stooges">The Stooges</a> album "<a href="Raw%20Power">Raw Power</a>" alongside Iggy Pop. His own "<a href="Aladdin%20Sane">Aladdin Sane</a>" (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number-one album. Described by Bowie as "Ziggy goes to America", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. "Aladdin Sane" spawned the UK top five singles "<a href="The%20Jean%20Genie">The Jean Genie</a>" and "<a href="Drive-In%20Saturday">Drive-In Saturday</a>".

Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity." His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both "Ziggy Stardust" and "Aladdin Sane", were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a <a href="sumo">sumo</a> wrestling loincloth or simulating <a href="oral%20sex">oral sex</a> with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage "retirement" at London's <a href="Hammersmith%20Odeon">Hammersmith Odeon</a> on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film "<a href="Ziggy%20Stardust%20and%20the%20Spiders%20from%20Mars%20%28film%29">Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>".
After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: "The Man Who Sold the World" had been re-released in 1972 along with "Space Oddity". "<a href="Life%20on%20Mars%3F">Life on Mars?</a>", from "Hunky Dory", was released in June 1973 and peaked at No. 3 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, "<a href="The%20Laughing%20Gnome">The Laughing Gnome</a>", reached No. 6. "<a href="Pin%20Ups">Pin Ups</a>", a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK No. 3 hit in his version of <a href="the%20McCoys">the McCoys</a>'s "<a href="Sorrow%20%28The%20McCoys%20song%29">Sorrow</a>" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.

Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. "<a href="Diamond%20Dogs">Diamond Dogs</a>" (1974), parts of which found him heading towards <a href="Soul%20music">soul</a> and <a href="funk">funk</a>, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-<a href="apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> city, and setting <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">1984</a>" to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "<a href="Rebel%20Rebel">Rebel Rebel</a>" and "<a href="Diamond%20Dogs%20%28song%29">Diamond Dogs</a>", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the <a href="Diamond%20Dogs%20Tour">Diamond Dogs Tour</a>, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by <a href="Toni%20Basil">Toni Basil</a>, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by <a href="Alan%20Yentob">Alan Yentob</a>. The resulting documentary, "<a href="Cracked%20Actor">Cracked Actor</a>", featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, "<a href="David%20Live">David Live</a>", ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory". "David Live" nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of <a href="Eddie%20Floyd">Eddie Floyd</a>'s "<a href="Knock%20on%20Wood%20%28song%29">Knock on Wood</a>". After a break in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.

The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was "<a href="Young%20Americans%20%28album%29">Young Americans</a>" (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now." The album's sound, which the singer identified as "<a href="plastic%20soul">plastic soul</a>", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. "Young Americans" yielded Bowie's first US number one, "<a href="Fame%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Fame</a>", co-written with <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>, who contributed backing vocals, and <a href="Carlos%20Alomar">Carlos Alomar</a>. Lennon called Bowie's work "great, but it's just rock'n'roll with lipstick on". Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show "<a href="Soul%20Train">Soul Train</a>", Bowie mimed "Fame", as well as "<a href="Golden%20Years%20%28song%29">Golden Years</a>", his November single, which was originally offered to <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, who declined it. "Young Americans" was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US. Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of Sandford, "for all his record sales (over a million copies of "Ziggy Stardust" alone), existed essentially on loose change." In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door." Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.
"<a href="Station%20to%20Station">Station to Station</a>" (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, introduced a new Bowie persona, "<a href="The%20Thin%20White%20Duke">The Thin White Duke</a>" of its title-track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>" the same year. Developing the funk and soul of "Young Americans", "Station to Station"'s synthesizer-heavy arrangements prefigured the <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a>-influenced music of his next releases. The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when <a href="Russell%20Harty">Russell Harty</a> interviewed the singer for his <a href="London%20Weekend%20Television">London Weekend Television</a> talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour. Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing lengthy conversation with Harty, Bowie was incoherent and looked "disconnected". His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.

"Station to Station"s January 1976 release was followed in February by a 3-month-long concert tour of Europe and North America. Featuring a starkly lit set, the <a href="Isolar%20%E2%80%93%201976%20Tour">Isolar – 1976 Tour</a> with its iconic colour newsprint <a href="Isolar">Isolar</a> concert program, highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy <a href="Station%20to%20Station%20%28song%29">title track</a>, the ballads "<a href="Wild%20Is%20the%20Wind%20%28song%29">Wild Is the Wind</a>" and "<a href="Word%20on%20a%20Wing">Word on a Wing</a>", and the funkier "<a href="TVC%2015">TVC 15</a>" and "<a href="Stay%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Stay</a>". The core band that coalesced to record this album and tour—rhythm guitarist <a href="Carlos%20Alomar">Carlos Alomar</a>, bassist <a href="George%20Murray%20%28musician%29">George Murray</a>, and drummer <a href="Dennis%20Davis">Dennis Davis</a>—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> paraphernalia.

Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the "<a href="London%20Victoria%20station">Victoria Station</a> incident". Arriving in an open-top <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes</a> <a href="convertible">convertible</a>, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a <a href="Nazi%20salute">Nazi salute</a>, which was captured on camera and published in "<a href="NME">NME</a>". Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had motivated these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with "NME", Bowie explained that Los Angeles was "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is."

After recovering from addiction, Bowie apologised for these statements, and throughout the 1980s and '90s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. Nevertheless, Bowie's comments on fascism, as well as <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>'s alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976, led to the establishment of <a href="Rock%20Against%20Racism">Rock Against Racism</a>.

Bowie moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career. He devoted more time to his painting, and produced a number of <a href="post-modernist">post-modernist</a> pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and the <a href="Br%C3%BCcke%20Museum">Brücke Museum</a> in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. ... Not only did he become a well-known patron of <a href="expressionist%20art">expressionist art</a>: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography."
Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in <a href="Sch%C3%B6neberg">Schöneberg</a> and <a href="Hansa%20Tonstudio">Hansa Tonstudio</a>, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in <a href="Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a>, near the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. While working with <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with <a href="Tony%20Visconti">Tony Visconti</a>, that became known as his <a href="Berlin%20Trilogy">Berlin Trilogy</a>. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut "<a href="The%20Idiot%20%28album%29">The Idiot</a>" and its follow-up "<a href="Lust%20for%20Life%20%28Iggy%20Pop%20album%29">Lust for Life</a>", touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.
The album "<a href="Low%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Low</a>" (1977), partly influenced by the <a href="Krautrock">Krautrock</a> sound of <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href="Neu%21">Neu!</a>, evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it. It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's former manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, "Low" yielded the UK No. 3 single "<a href="Sound%20and%20Vision">Sound and Vision</a>", and its own performance surpassed that of "Station to Station" in the UK chart, where it reached No. 2. Leading contemporary composer <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> described "Low" as "a work of genius" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his "<a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Glass%29">Symphony No. 1 "Low"</a>"; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 "<a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Glass%29">Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"</a>". Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces". Also in 1977, <a href="London%20Records">London</a> released "Starting Point", a ten-song LP containing releases from Bowie's <a href="Deram%20Records">Deram</a> period (1966—67).
Echoing "Low"s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, "<a href="%26quot%3BHeroes%26quot%3B%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">"Heroes"</a>" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>. Like "Low", ""Heroes"" evinced the <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and <a href="Koto%20%28instrument%29">koto</a>, the album was another hit, reaching No. 3 in the UK. Its <a href="%26quot%3BHeroes%26quot%3B%20%28song%29">title-track</a>, though only reaching No. 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French. Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show "<a href="Marc%20%28TV%20series%29">Marc</a>", and again two days later for <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>'s final <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in "<a href="Peace%20on%20Earth/Little%20Drummer%20Boy">Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy</a>", a version of "<a href="The%20Little%20Drummer%20Boy">The Little Drummer Boy</a>" with a new, <a href="Counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> verse. Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at No. 3 on Christmas Day, 1982.

After completing "Low" and ""Heroes"", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the <a href="Isolar%20II%20%E2%80%93%20The%201978%20World%20Tour">Isolar II world tour</a>, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends." Recordings from the tour made up the live album "<a href="Stage%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Stage</a>", released the same year.

The final piece in what Bowie called his "<a href="triptych">triptych</a>", "<a href="Lodger%20%28album%29">Lodger</a>" (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> and <a href="world%20music">world music</a>, in places incorporating <a href="Phrygian%20dominant%20scale">Hijaz</a> <a href="Musical%20scale%23Non-Western%20scales">non-Western scales</a>. Some tracks were composed using Eno and <a href="Peter%20Schmidt%20%28artist%29">Peter Schmidt</a>'s <a href="Oblique%20Strategies">Oblique Strategies</a> cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sergeant Pepper</a>" ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno." "Lodger" reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "<a href="Boys%20Keep%20Swinging">Boys Keep Swinging</a>" and "<a href="DJ%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">DJ</a>". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.

"<a href="Scary%20Monsters%20and%20Super%20Creeps">Scary Monsters and Super Creeps</a>" (1980) produced the number-one hit "<a href="Ashes%20to%20Ashes%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Ashes to Ashes</a>", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist <a href="Chuck%20Hammer">Chuck Hammer</a> and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground <a href="New%20Romantic">New Romantic</a> movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including <a href="Steve%20Strange">Steve Strange</a> of the band <a href="Visage%20%28band%29">Visage</a>) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While "Scary Monsters" used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>, <a href="Chuck%20Hammer">Chuck Hammer</a>, and <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a>. As "Ashes to Ashes" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">John Merrick</a> in "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28play%29">The Elephant Man</a>".

Bowie paired with <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> in 1981 for a one-off single release, "<a href="Under%20Pressure">Under Pressure</a>". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s play "<a href="Baal%20%28play%29">Baal</a>". Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as "<a href="Baal%20%28EP%29">David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal</a>". In March 1982, the month before <a href="Paul%20Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>'s film "<a href="Cat%20People%20%281982%20film%29">Cat People</a>" came out, Bowie's title song, "<a href="Cat%20People%20%28Putting%20Out%20Fire%29">Cat People (Putting Out Fire)</a>", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.

Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with "<a href="Let%27s%20Dance%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Let's Dance</a>". Co-produced by <a href="Chic%20%28band%29">Chic</a>'s <a href="Nile%20Rodgers">Nile Rodgers</a>, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its <a href="Let%27s%20Dance%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">title track</a> reached number one. "<a href="Modern%20Love%20%28song%29">Modern Love</a>" and "<a href="China%20Girl%20%28song%29">China Girl</a>" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of "absorbing" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said "activated key archetypes in the pop world. 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aborigine</a> couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film "<a href="From%20Here%20to%20Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a>"), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV". <a href="Stevie%20Ray%20Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a> was guest guitarist playing solo on "Let's Dance", although the video depicts Bowie miming this part. By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day. "Let's Dance" was followed by the <a href="Serious%20Moonlight%20Tour">Serious Moonlight Tour</a>, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist <a href="Earl%20Slick">Earl Slick</a> and backing vocalists <a href="The%20Simms%20Brothers%20Band">Frank and George Simms</a>. The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular." At the <a href="1984%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">1984 MTV Video Music Awards</a> Bowie received two awards including the inaugural <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20Video%20Vanguard%20Award">Video Vanguard Award</a>.
"<a href="Tonight%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Tonight</a>" (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a> and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">Beach Boys</a> hit "<a href="God%20Only%20Knows">God Only Knows</a>". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit "<a href="Blue%20Jean%20%28song%29">Blue Jean</a>", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Video">Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video</a>, "<a href="Jazzin%27%20for%20Blue%20Jean">Jazzin' for Blue Jean</a>". Bowie performed at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1985 for <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a>, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>. "<a href="Dancing%20in%20the%20Street">Dancing in the Street</a>" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the <a href="Pat%20Metheny%20Group">Pat Metheny Group</a> to record "<a href="This%20Is%20Not%20America">This Is Not America</a>" for the soundtrack of "<a href="The%20Falcon%20and%20the%20Snowman">The Falcon and the Snowman</a>". Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.

Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film "<a href="Absolute%20Beginners%20%28film%29">Absolute Beginners</a>". It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's <a href="Theme%20music">theme song</a>, also named "<a href="Absolute%20Beginners%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Absolute Beginners</a>", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as <a href="Jareth">Jareth</a>, the Goblin King, in the 1986 <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a> film "<a href="Labyrinth%20%28film%29">Labyrinth</a>", for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's "<a href="Never%20Let%20Me%20Down">Never Let Me Down</a>", where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an <a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a>/<a href="techno">techno</a> dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits "<a href="Day-In%20Day-Out">Day-In, Day-Out</a>" (his 60th single), "<a href="Time%20Will%20Crawl">Time Will Crawl</a>", and "<a href="Never%20Let%20Me%20Down%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Never Let Me Down</a>". Bowie later described it as his "nadir", calling it "an awful album". Supporting "Never Let Me Down", and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert <a href="Glass%20Spider%20Tour">Glass Spider Tour</a> commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included <a href="Peter%20Frampton">Peter Frampton</a> on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current <a href="arena%20rock">stadium rock</a> trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, and <a href="U2">U2</a>.

Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, <a href="Tin%20Machine">Tin Machine</a> came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist <a href="Reeves%20Gabrels">Reeves Gabrels</a>. The line-up was completed by <a href="Tony%20Fox%20Sales">Tony</a> and <a href="Hunt%20Sales">Hunt Sales</a>, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album "Lust for Life".
Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, "<a href="Tin%20Machine%20%28album%29">Tin Machine</a>" (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of <a href="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazis</a>"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book." EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.

Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month <a href="Sound%2BVision%20Tour">Sound+Vision Tour</a>, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.

In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and <a href="Somalis">Somali</a>-born supermodel <a href="Iman%20%28model%29">Iman</a> were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate." They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. "<a href="Tin%20Machine%20II">Tin Machine II</a>"s arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, <a href="Victory%20Records">Victory</a>, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude <a href="Kouros">Kouroi</a> statues, judged by Bowie to be "in exquisite taste", "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album "" failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.

On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at <a href="The%20Freddie%20Mercury%20Tribute%20Concert">The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert</a>, following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing "Heroes" and "All the Young Dudes", he was joined on "Under Pressure" by <a href="Annie%20Lennox">Annie Lennox</a>, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the <a href="1992%20Los%20Angeles%20riots">1992 Los Angeles riots</a> began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.
In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz, and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> influenced "<a href="Black%20Tie%20White%20Noise">Black Tie White Noise</a>". Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with "Let's Dance" producer <a href="Nile%20Rodgers">Nile Rodgers</a>, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number-one spot on the UK charts and spawning three Top 40 hits, including the Top 10 single "<a href="Jump%20They%20Say">Jump They Say</a>". Bowie explored new directions on "<a href="The%20Buddha%20of%20Suburbia%20%28soundtrack%29">The Buddha of Suburbia</a>" (1993), ostensibly a soundtrack album of his music composed for the BBC television adaptation of <a href="The%20Buddha%20of%20Suburbia%20%28novel%29">Hanif Kureishi's novel</a>. Only the title track had been used in the television adaptation, although some of his <a href="Subject%20%28music%29">themes</a> for it were also present on the album. It contained some of the new elements introduced in "Black Tie White Noise", and also signalled a move towards <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>. The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made No. 87 in the UK charts.

Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-<a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> "<a href="Outside%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Outside</a>" (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success, and yielded three Top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> as his tour partner for the <a href="Outside%20Tour">Outside Tour</a>. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, New York, at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, <a href="Dave%20Grohl">Dave Grohl</a> and the <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a> of <a href="the%20Cure">the Cure</a>, <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> of <a href="the%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">the Smashing Pumpkins</a>, <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a> of the <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, and <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>.

Bowie was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> on 17 January 1996. Incorporating experiments in British jungle and <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum 'n' bass</a>, "<a href="Earthling%20%28album%29">Earthling</a>" (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album – "<a href="Little%20Wonder%20%28song%29">Little Wonder</a>" and "<a href="Dead%20Man%20Walking%20%28song%29">Dead Man Walking</a>" – became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song "<a href="I%27m%20Afraid%20of%20Americans">I'm Afraid of Americans</a>" from the <a href="Paul%20Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a> film "<a href="Showgirls">Showgirls</a>" was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. Bowie received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> on 12 February 1997. The <a href="Earthling%20Tour">Earthling Tour</a> took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997. In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC's <a href="Children%20in%20Need">Children in Need</a> charity single "<a href="Perfect%20Day%2097">Perfect Day</a>", which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record "(Safe in This) Sky Life" for "<a href="The%20Rugrats%20Movie">The Rugrats Movie</a>". Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as "Safe" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single "<a href="Everyone%20Says%20%27Hi%27">Everyone Says 'Hi'</a>. The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of <a href="Placebo%20%28band%29">Placebo's</a> track "<a href="Without%20You%20I%27m%20Nothing%20%28song%29">Without You I'm Nothing</a>", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.

"Bowie Bonds", an early example of <a href="celebrity%20bond">celebrity bond</a>s, were <a href="Asset-backed%20security">asset-backed securities</a> of current and future revenues of the 25 albums (287 songs) that Bowie recorded before 1990. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the <a href="Prudential%20Financial">Prudential Insurance Company of America</a>. <a href="Royalty%20payment">Royalties</a> from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments. By forfeiting ten years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager, <a href="Tony%20Defries">Tony Defries</a>. The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.

In September 1998, Bowie launched an <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet service provider</a>, BowieNet, developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy. Subscribers to the <a href="Dial-up%20Internet%20access">dial-up</a> service were offered exclusive content, as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006.

Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels, created the soundtrack for "", a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from "Omikron", his album "<a href="Hours%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Hours</a>" featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his "Cyber Song Contest" Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica. Sessions for the planned album "<a href="Toy%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Toy</a>", intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album "<a href="Heathen%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Heathen</a>".

On 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> in England, playing 30 years after his first. On 27 June, Bowie performed a concert at <a href="Broadcasting%20House">BBC Radio Theatre</a> in London, which was released in the compilation album "<a href="Bowie%20at%20the%20Beeb">Bowie at the Beeb</a>", which also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972. Bowie and Iman's daughter was born on 15 August.

In October 2001, Bowie opened <a href="the%20Concert%20for%20New%20York%20City">the Concert for New York City</a>, a charity event to benefit the victims of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, with a minimalist performance of <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Garfunkel">Simon & Garfunkel</a>'s "<a href="America%20%28Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Garfunkel%20song%29">America</a>", followed by a full band performance of "Heroes". 2002 saw the release of "Heathen", and, during the second half of the year, the <a href="Heathen%20Tour">Heathen Tour</a>. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual "<a href="Meltdown%20%28festival%29">Meltdown</a>" festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>, <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a>, and <a href="the%20Dandy%20Warhols">the Dandy Warhols</a>. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's "<a href="Low%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Low</a>" era. "<a href="Reality%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Reality</a>" (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the <a href="A%20Reality%20Tour">A Reality Tour</a>, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. Onstage in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, Norway, on 18 June, Bowie was hit in the eye with a lollipop thrown by a fan; a week later he suffered chest pain while performing at the <a href="Hurricane%20Festival">Hurricane Festival</a> in <a href="Schee%C3%9Fel">Scheeßel</a>, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked <a href="Coronary%20circulation">coronary artery</a>, requiring an emergency <a href="angioplasty">angioplasty</a> in Hamburg. The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled. That same year, his interest in <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> led him to support the <a href="Tibetan%20Buddhism">Tibetan</a> cause by performing at a concert to support the New York <a href="Tibet%20House">Tibet House</a>.

In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song "<a href="Changes%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Changes</a>" with <a href="Butterfly%20Boucher">Butterfly Boucher</a> for the 2004 animated film "<a href="Shrek%202">Shrek 2</a>".

During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song "(She Can) Do That", co-written with <a href="BT%20%28musician%29">Brian Transeau</a>, for the film "<a href="Stealth%20%28film%29">Stealth</a>". He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with <a href="Arcade%20Fire">Arcade Fire</a> for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the <a href="CMJ">CMJ</a> Music Marathon. He contributed backing vocals on <a href="TV%20on%20the%20Radio">TV on the Radio</a>'s song "Province" for their album "<a href="Return%20to%20Cookie%20Mountain">Return to Cookie Mountain</a>", made a commercial with <a href="Snoop%20Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a> for <a href="XM%20Satellite%20Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers <a href="Kashmir%20%28band%29">Kashmir's</a> 2005 album "<a href="No%20Balance%20Palace">No Balance Palace</a>".

Bowie was awarded the <a href="Grammy%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award</a> on 8 February 2006. In April, he announced, "I'm taking a year off—no touring, no albums." He made a surprise guest appearance at <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a>'s 29 May concert at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London. The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released. He performed again in November, alongside <a href="Alicia%20Keys">Alicia Keys</a>, at the Black Ball, a benefit event for <a href="Keep%20a%20Child%20Alive">Keep a Child Alive</a> at the <a href="Hammerstein%20Ballroom">Hammerstein Ballroom</a> in New York. The performance marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.

Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, selecting musicians and artists for the <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> event, including electronic pop duo <a href="AIR%20%28French%20band%29">AIR</a>, surrealist photographer <a href="Claude%20Cahun">Claude Cahun</a>, and English comedian <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>. Bowie performed on <a href="Scarlett%20Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a>'s 2008 album of <a href="Tom%20Waits">Tom Waits</a> covers, "<a href="Anywhere%20I%20Lay%20My%20Head">Anywhere I Lay My Head</a>". On the 40th anniversary of the <a href="Apollo%20program">July 1969 moon landing</a>—and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with "Space Oddity"—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix. "<a href="A%20Reality%20Tour%20%28album%29">A Reality Tour</a>", a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.

In late March 2011, "<a href="Toy%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Toy</a>", Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for "Heathen" and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.

On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new album, to be titled "<a href="The%20Next%20Day">The Next Day</a>" and scheduled for release 8 March for Australia, 12 March for the United States, and 11 March for the rest of the world. Bowie's first studio album in a decade, "The Next Day" contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks. His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus. Record producer <a href="Tony%20Visconti">Tony Visconti</a> said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record, which he might start work on later in 2013. The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, "<a href="Where%20Are%20We%20Now%3F">Where Are We Now?</a>", written and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by longtime collaborator Visconti.

A music video for "Where Are We Now?" was released onto <a href="Vimeo">Vimeo</a> the same day, directed by New York artist <a href="Tony%20Oursler">Tony Oursler</a>. The single topped the UK <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> at No. 6, his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since "<a href="Jump%20They%20Say">Jump They Say</a>" in 1993). A second video, "The Stars (Are Out Tonight)", was released 25 February. Directed by <a href="Floria%20Sigismondi">Floria Sigismondi</a>, it stars Bowie and <a href="Tilda%20Swinton">Tilda Swinton</a> as a married couple. On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>. "The Next Day" debuted at No. 1 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, was his first album to achieve that position since "Black Tie White Noise" (1993), and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song "<a href="The%20Next%20Day%20%28song%29">The Next Day</a>" created some controversy, initially being removed from YouTube for <a href="Terms%20of%20service">terms-of-service</a> violation, then restored with a warning recommending viewing only by those 18 or over.

According to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", Bowie ruled out ever giving an interview again. An exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called "<a href="David%20Bowie%20Is">David Bowie Is</a>", was organised by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London, and shown there in 2013. The London exhibit was visited by 311,956 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Toronto</a> and included stops in <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Groningen">Groningen</a> and <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York where the exhibit ended on 15 July at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>. Bowie was featured in a cameo vocal in the <a href="Arcade%20Fire">Arcade Fire</a> song <a href="Reflektor%20%28song%29">"Reflektor"</a>. A poll carried out by BBC History Magazine, in October 2013, named Bowie as the best-dressed Briton in history.

At the <a href="2014%20Brit%20Awards">2014 Brit Awards</a> on 19 February, Bowie became the oldest recipient of a <a href="Brit%20Awards">Brit Award</a> in the ceremony's history when he won the award for Best British Male, which was collected on his behalf by <a href="Kate%20Moss">Kate Moss</a>. His speech read: "I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us." Bowie's reference to the forthcoming September 2014 <a href="Scottish%20independence%20referendum%2C%202014">Scottish independence referendum</a> garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on <a href="social%20media">social media</a>. On 18 July, Bowie indicated that future music would be forthcoming, though he was vague about details.

New information was released in September 2014 regarding his next compilation album, "<a href="Nothing%20Has%20Changed">Nothing Has Changed</a>", which was released in November. The album featured rare tracks and old material from his catalogue in addition to a new song titled "<a href="Sue%20%28Or%20in%20a%20Season%20of%20Crime%29">Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)</a>". In May 2015, "Let's Dance" was announced to be reissued as a yellow vinyl single on 16 July 2015 in conjunction with the "David Bowie Is" exhibition at the <a href="Australian%20Centre%20for%20the%20Moving%20Image">Australian Centre for the Moving Image</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia.
In August 2015, it was announced that Bowie was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>" cartoon series. Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series "<a href="The%20Last%20Panthers">The Last Panthers</a>", which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for "The Last Panthers" was also the title track for his January 2016 release "<a href="Blackstar%20%28album%29">Blackstar</a>" which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to "The Times": ""Blackstar" may be the oddest work yet from Bowie". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical "<a href="Lazarus%20%28musical%29">Lazarus</a>" debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.

"Blackstar" was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his <a href="swan%20song">swan song</a>, and a "parting gift" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with <a href="CNN">CNN</a> noting that the album "reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-"Blackstar" album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>'s <a href="Vevo%23Record%20holders">most viewed artist in a single day</a>. On 15 January, "Blackstar" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. "Blackstar" also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the US "Billboard" 200.

, more than 1.3 million people had visited the "<a href="David%20Bowie%20Is">David Bowie Is</a>" exhibit, making it the most successful exhibition ever staged by the Victoria and Albert Museum in terms of worldwide attendance. The museum stated that the exhibition would continue to tour, with confirmed travel to Japan in 2017. At the <a href="59th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">59th Annual Grammy Awards</a>, Bowie won all five nominated awards: <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Performance">Best Rock Performance</a>; <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a>; <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Engineered%20Album%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical</a>; <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Recording%20Package">Best Recording Package</a>; and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Song">Best Rock Song</a>. The wins marked Bowie's first ever in musical categories.

An EP, "<a href="No%20Plan%20%28EP%29">No Plan</a>", was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday. Apart from "Lazarus", the EP includes three songs that Bowie had recorded during the "Blackstar" sessions, but were left off the album and subsequently appeared on the <a href="Lazarus%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack album</a> for the "Lazarus" musical in October 2016. A music video for the title track was also released. Since January 2016, Bowie has sold 5 million units in the United Kingdom alone.

The beginnings of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> theatre and <a href="mime%20artist">mime</a> under <a href="Lindsay%20Kemp">Lindsay Kemp</a>, he was given the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production "Pierrot in Turquoise" (later made into the 1970 television film "The Looking Glass Murders"). In the black-and-white <a href="short%20film">short</a> "<a href="The%20Image%20%28short%20film%29">The Image</a>" (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him. The same year, the film of <a href="Leslie%20Thomas">Leslie Thomas</a>'s 1966 comic novel "<a href="The%20Virgin%20Soldiers">The Virgin Soldiers</a>" saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra. In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>", directed by <a href="Nicolas%20Roeg">Nicolas Roeg</a>. "<a href="Just%20a%20Gigolo%20%281978%20film%29">Just a Gigolo</a>" (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by <a href="David%20Hemmings">David Hemmings</a>, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (<a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a>) and put into her Gigolo Stable.

Bowie played <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a> in the Broadway theatre production "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28play%29">The Elephant Man</a>", which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, and which earned high praise for his expressive performance. He played the part 157 times between 1980 and 1981. "<a href="Christiane%20F.%20%E2%80%93%20We%20Children%20from%20Bahnhof%20Zoo">Christiane F. – We Children from Bahnhof Zoo</a>", a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl's drug addiction in <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, "<a href="Christiane%20F.%20%28album%29">Christiane F.</a>" (1981), featured much material from his Berlin Trilogy albums. Bowie starred in "<a href="The%20Hunger%20%281983%20film%29">The Hunger</a>" (1983), with <a href="Catherine%20Deneuve">Catherine Deneuve</a> and <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>. In <a href="Nagisa%20Oshima">Nagisa Oshima</a>'s film the same year, "<a href="Merry%20Christmas%2C%20Mr.%20Lawrence">Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</a>", based on <a href="Laurens%20van%20der%20Post">Laurens van der Post</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Seed%20and%20the%20Sower">The Seed and the Sower</a>", Bowie played Major Jack Celliers, a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp. Bowie had a cameo in "<a href="Yellowbeard">Yellowbeard</a>", a 1983 pirate comedy created by <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a> members, and a small part as Colin, the <a href="Contract%20killing">hitman</a> in the 1985 film "<a href="Into%20the%20Night%20%28film%29">Into the Night</a>". He declined to play the villain <a href="Max%20Zorin">Max Zorin</a> in the <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> film "<a href="A%20View%20to%20a%20Kill">A View to a Kill</a>" (1985).

"<a href="Absolute%20Beginners%20%28film%29">Absolute Beginners</a>" (1986), a <a href="rock%20musical">rock musical</a> film <a href="Film%20adaptation">adapted</a> from <a href="Colin%20MacInnes">Colin MacInnes</a>'s <a href="Absolute%20Beginners%20%28novel%29">book of the same name</a> about life in late 1950s London, featured Bowie's music and presented him with a minor acting role. The same year, <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a>'s dark fantasy "<a href="Labyrinth%20%28film%29">Labyrinth</a>" found him with the part of Jareth, the king of the <a href="goblin">goblin</a>s. Two years later, he played <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> in <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s 1988 film "<a href="The%20Last%20Temptation%20of%20Christ%20%28film%29">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>". Bowie portrayed a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite <a href="Rosanna%20Arquette">Rosanna Arquette</a> in "<a href="The%20Linguini%20Incident">The Linguini Incident</a>" (1991), and the mysterious <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agent <a href="Phillip%20Jeffries">Phillip Jeffries</a> in David Lynch's "" (1992). He took a small but pivotal role as <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> in "<a href="Basquiat%20%28film%29">Basquiat</a>", artist/director <a href="Julian%20Schnabel">Julian Schnabel</a>'s 1996 biopic of <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, and co-starred in <a href="Giovanni%20Veronesi">Giovanni Veronesi</a>'s <a href="Spaghetti%20Western">Spaghetti Western</a> "Il Mio West" (1998, released as "<a href="Gunslinger%27s%20Revenge">Gunslinger's Revenge</a>" in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region. He played the ageing gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth's "<a href="Everybody%20Loves%20Sunshine">Everybody Loves Sunshine</a>" (1999), and appeared in the television horror series of "<a href="The%20Hunger%20%28TV%20series%29">The Hunger</a>". In "Mr. Rice's Secret" (2000), he played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old, and the following year appeared as himself in "<a href="Zoolander">Zoolander</a>".

Bowie portrayed physicist <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> in <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Prestige%20%28film%29">The Prestige</a>" (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. In the same year, he voice-acted in the animated film "<a href="Arthur%20and%20the%20Invisibles">Arthur and the Invisibles</a>" as the powerful villain Maltazard and appeared as himself in an episode of the <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a> television series "<a href="Extras%20%28TV%20series%29">Extras</a>". In 2007, he lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the "<a href="SpongeBob%27s%20Atlantis%20SquarePantis">SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis</a>" television film. In the 2008 film "<a href="August%20%282008%20film%29">August</a>", directed by <a href="Austin%20Chick">Austin Chick</a>, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, alongside <a href="Josh%20Hartnett">Josh Hartnett</a> and <a href="Rip%20Torn">Rip Torn</a>, with whom he had worked in the 1976 film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>".

In a 2017 interview with "Consequence of Sound", director <a href="Denis%20Villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a> revealed his intention to cast Bowie in "<a href="Blade%20Runner%202049">Blade Runner 2049</a>" as the lead villain, Niander Wallace, but when news broke of Bowie's death in January of the same year, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar "rock star" qualities. He eventually cast actor and lead singer of <a href="Thirty%20Seconds%20to%20Mars">Thirty Seconds to Mars</a>, <a href="Jared%20Leto">Jared Leto</a>. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: "Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the Blade Runner spirit."

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited <a href="Marc%20Bolan">Marc Bolan</a> and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> music movement. When punk musicians were "noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance", biographer David Buckley wrote that "Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation." Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, "There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie". 

Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. <a href="The%20Human%20League">The Human League</a> founder <a href="Martyn%20Ware">Martyn Ware</a> remarked that he had lived his life "as though he were an art installation." The BBC's arts editor <a href="Will%20Gompertz">Will Gompertz</a> likened Bowie to <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, writing that he was "an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions". <a href="U2">U2</a> lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> commented, "I like Bowie when he’s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle. That’s usually my favorite, when the songwriting is disciplined but the recording is not. I love when he's pulled equally in the directions of art and populism."

Broadcaster <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> contrasted Bowie with his <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was "an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things". Peel said he "liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change". Buckley called the era "bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied"; then Bowie "subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star".

Buckley called Bowie "both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."

Through continual reinvention, his influence broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, "Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie." In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the "most influential artist of all time" in a poll by "<a href="NME">NME</a>". <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be "the most important and influential artist since <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>". <a href="Neil%20McCormick">Neil McCormick</a> of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" stated that Bowie had "one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century" and "he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with". The BBC's <a href="Mark%20Easton">Mark Easton</a> argued that Bowie provided fuel for "the creative powerhouse that Britain has become" by challenging future generations "to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks". Easton concluded that Bowie had "changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself". Annie Zaleski of "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28music%20magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>" wrote, "Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie". In 2016, he was dubbed "The Greatest Rock Star Ever" by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine.

Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a>s on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and <a href="Popular%20culture">pop culture</a>, such as those from the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a>, namely Cardinal <a href="Gianfranco%20Ravasi">Gianfranco Ravasi</a>, who quoted "Space Oddity", and the <a href="Federal%20Foreign%20Office">Federal Foreign Office</a>, which thanked Bowie for his part in the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> and referenced "Heroes".

On 7 January 2017 the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary "David Bowie: The Last Five Years", taking a detailed look at Bowie's last albums, "The Next Day" and "Blackstar", and his play "Lazarus". On 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by the actor <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>, a close friend. A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched, and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Tokyo.

On 6 February 2018 the <a href="Falcon%20Heavy%20Test%20Flight">maiden flight</a> of the <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> <a href="Falcon%20Heavy">Falcon Heavy</a> rocket carried <a href="Elon%20Musk">Elon Musk</a>'s personal <a href="Elon%20Musk%27s%20Tesla%20Roadster">Tesla Roadster</a> and a mannequin affectionately named <a href="Starman%20%28song%29">Starman</a> into space. "<a href="Space%20Oddity">Space Oddity</a>" and "<a href="Life%20on%20Mars%3F">Life on Mars?</a>" were looping on the car's sound system during the launch.

It was announced on 31 January 2019 that musician and actor <a href="Johnny%20Flynn%20%28musician%29">Johnny Flynn</a> would be playing Bowie in an upcoming <a href="biopic">biopic</a> titled "Stardust" which will be set around Bowie's first trip to the United States in 1971. Christopher Bell is writing the script and <a href="Gabriel%20Range">Gabriel Range</a> will direct. Actress <a href="Jena%20Malone">Jena Malone</a> has signed on to play Bowie's wife Angie while actor <a href="Marc%20Maron">Marc Maron</a> will play Bowie's record company publicist. 

On 1 February 2019, Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film saying that he knew nothing about the movie and was informed about it by a fan on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>. Jones also said that the film would not have permission to use any of Bowie's music. “Pretty certain nobody has been granted music rights for ANY biopic… I would know. I’m not saying this movie is not happening. I honestly wouldn’t know. I’m saying that as it stands, this movie won’t have any of dads music in it, & I can’t imagine that changing."

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a> and <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor <a href="Anthony%20Newley">Anthony Newley</a>, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, "<a href="David%20Bowie%20%281967%20album%29">David Bowie</a>" (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.

Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, "<a href="Space%20Oddity">Space Oddity</a>", and later in the song "<a href="%26quot%3BHeroes%26quot%3B%20%28song%29">Heroes</a>", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that "in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness."

Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as "particularly deliberate and distinctive". Schinder and Schwartz call him "a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect." Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's role playing is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics "arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section." In a 2014 analysis of 77 "top" artists' vocal ranges, Bowie was 8th, just behind <a href="Christina%20Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> and just ahead of <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesizers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; <a href="stylophone">stylophone</a>; <a href="viola">viola</a>; cello; <a href="Koto%20%28instrument%29">koto</a> (in the "Heroes" track "Moss Garden"); <a href="Mbira">thumb piano</a>; drums (on the "Heathen" track "Cactus"), and various percussion instruments.

Bowie was also a painter and artist. One of his paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for $500, and the cover for his 1995 album "<a href="Outside%20%28David%20Bowie%20album%29">Outside</a>" is a close-up of a self-portrait (from a series of five) he painted that same year. His first solo show was at The Gallery, <a href="Cork%20Street">Cork Street</a> in 1995, entitled 'New Afro/Pagan and Work: 1975–1995'. He was invited to join the editorial board of the journal "<a href="Modern%20Painters%20%28magazine%29">Modern Painters</a>" in 1998, and participated in the art hoax later that year.

In 1998 during an interview with <a href="Michael%20Kimmelman">Michael Kimmelman</a> for <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a> he said "Art was, seriously, the only thing I'd ever wanted to own.", subsequently in 1999, in an interview for the BBC, he said "The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art". His art collection, which included works by <a href="Damien%20Hirst">Damien Hirst</a>, <a href="Frank%20Auerbach">Frank Auerbach</a>, <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a>, and <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> among others, was valued at over £10m in mid-2016.

After his death his family decided to sell most of the collection because they "didn't have the space" to store it. On 10 and 11 November three auctions were held at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> in London, first with 47 lots and second with 208 paintings, drawings, and sculptures, third with 100 design lots. The items on sale represented about 65 percent of the collection. Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51,470 visitors, the auction itself was attended by 1,750 bidders, with over 1,000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total £32.9 million (app. $41.5 million), while the highest-selling item, <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>'s graffiti-inspired painting "Air Power", sold for £7.09 million.

Bowie married his first wife, <a href="Angela%20Bowie">Mary Angela Barnett</a> on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in <a href="Bromley">Bromley</a>, London. Their son <a href="Duncan%20Jones">Duncan</a>, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie. Bowie and Angela divorced on 8 February 1980 in Switzerland.

On 24 April 1992, Bowie married <a href="Somali%20people">Somali</a>-American model <a href="Iman%20%28model%29">Iman</a> in a private ceremony in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>. The wedding was later solemnised on 6 June in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. They had one daughter, Alexandria "Lexi" Zahra Jones, born in August 2000. The couple resided primarily in New York City and London, as well as owning an apartment in Sydney's <a href="Elizabeth%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Elizabeth Bay</a>. and Britannia Bay House on the island of <a href="Mustique">Mustique</a>, now renamed <a href="Mandalay%20Estate%20Mustique">Mandalay Estate</a>.

Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality." In a September 1976 interview with "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>", Bowie said, "It's true—I am a <a href="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me." His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>.

In a 1983 interview with "Rolling Stone", Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake I ever made" and "I was always a closet heterosexual." On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.

"<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, "I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in "<a href="Puritans">puritanical</a>" America, "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."

Buckley wrote that Bowie "mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock", and was probably "never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual", instead experimenting "out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'." Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie "created their bisexual fantasy". Sandford wrote that Bowie "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women." The BBC's <a href="Mark%20Easton">Mark Easton</a> wrote in 2016 that Britain was "far more tolerant of difference" and that gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, and gender equality would not have "enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago".

Over the years, Bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality. Beginning in 1967, he showed an interest in <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>; after a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by a <a href="Lama">Lama</a>, "You don't want to be Buddhist... You should follow music." By 1975, Bowie admitted, "I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God."

After Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992, he said they knew that their "real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at <a href="The%20Freddie%20Mercury%20Tribute%20Concert">The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert</a> and recited the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> before a television audience. In 1993, Bowie said he had an "undying" belief in the "unquestionable" existence of God. In a separate 1993 interview, while describing the genesis of the music for his album "<a href="Black%20Tie%20White%20Noise">Black Tie White Noise</a>", he said " … it was important for me to find something [musically] that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion, of which I'm not a believer, I must make that clear." Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists "is not a question that can be answered... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm "almost" an atheist. Give me a couple of months... I've nearly got it right. In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be <a href="Cremation">cremated</a> and his ashes scattered in <a href="Bali">Bali</a> "in accordance with the Buddhist rituals".

"Questioning my spiritual life has always been germane" to Bowie's songwriting. "<a href="Station%20to%20Station%20%28song%29">Station to Station</a>" is "very much concerned with the <a href="Stations%20of%20the%20Cross">Stations of the Cross</a>"; the song also specifically references <a href="Christian%20Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>. Bowie called the album "extremely dark... the nearest album to a <a href="Magick%20%28Thelema%29">magick</a> treatise that I've written". "<a href="Earthling%20%28album%29">Earthling</a>" showed "the abiding need in me to vacillate between <a href="atheism">atheism</a> or a kind of <a href="gnosticism">gnosticism</a>... What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise." Released shortly before his death, "<a href="Lazarus%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Lazarus</a>"—from his final album, "<a href="Blackstar%20%28album%29">Blackstar</a>"—began with the words, "Look up here, I'm in Heaven" while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality.

In 1976, speaking as <a href="The%20Thin%20White%20Duke">The Thin White Duke</a>, Bowie's persona at the time, and "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in interviews with "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>", "NME", and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." He was also quoted as saying: "Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars" and "You've got to have an <a href="Far-right%20politics">extreme right</a> front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed."

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards <a href="anti-racism">anti-racism</a> and <a href="anti-fascism">anti-fascism</a>. In an interview with <a href="MTV">MTV</a> in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of black musicians, and the music videos for "China Girl" and "Let's Dance" were described by Bowie as a "very simple, very direct" statement against racism. The album "Tin Machine" took a more direct stance against fascism and Neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy.

In 2016, filmmaker and activist <a href="Michael%20Moore">Michael Moore</a> said he had wanted to use "<a href="Panic%20in%20Detroit">Panic in Detroit</a>" for his 1998 documentary "<a href="The%20Big%20One%20%28film%29">The Big One</a>"; denied at first, he was given the rights after calling Bowie personally. "I've read stuff since his death saying that he wasn't that political and he stayed away from politics. But that wasn't the conversation that I had with him."

On 10 January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of the album "<a href="Blackstar%20%28album%29">Blackstar</a>", Bowie died from <a href="liver%20cancer">liver cancer</a> in his New York City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but had not made the news of his illness public. The Belgian theatre director <a href="Ivo%20van%20Hove">Ivo van Hove</a>, who had worked with the singer on his <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> musical "<a href="Lazarus%20%28musical%29">Lazarus</a>", explained that Bowie was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.

Bowie's producer Tony Visconti wrote:

Following Bowie's death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows him in his "<a href="Aladdin%20Sane">Aladdin Sane</a>" character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. As he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, Indonesia.

Bowie's 1969 commercial breakthrough, the song "Space Oddity", won him an <a href="Ivor%20Novello%20Awards">Ivor Novello</a> Special Award For Originality. For his performance in the 1976 science fiction film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Fell%20to%20Earth">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>", he won a <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Saturn Award for Best Actor</a>. In the ensuing decades he was honoured with numerous awards for his music and its accompanying videos, receiving, among others, six <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s and four <a href="Brit%20Awards">Brit Awards</a>—winning Best British Male Artist twice; the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1996; and the Brits Icon award for his "lasting impact on <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British culture</a>", given posthumously in 2016.

In 1999, Bowie was made a Commander of the <a href="Ordre%20des%20Arts%20et%20des%20Lettres">Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</a> by the French government. He received an honorary doctorate from <a href="Berklee%20College%20of%20Music">Berklee College of Music</a> the same year. He declined the royal honour of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a <a href="knight">knight</a>hood in 2003. Bowie later stated "I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for."
"<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" in 2016 estimated Bowie's total worldwide sales at 140 million records. In the United Kingdom, he was awarded 9 platinum, 11 gold, and 8 silver albums, and in the United States, 5 platinum and 9 gold.

In 2003, six of Bowie's albums appeared on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s list of the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>.
