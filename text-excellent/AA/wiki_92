Metacomet Ridge

The Metacomet Ridge, Metacomet Ridge Mountains, or Metacomet Range of southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a> is a narrow and steep <a href="fault-block">fault-block</a> mountain ridge known for its extensive cliff faces, scenic vistas, <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a> ecosystems, and rare or endangered plants. The ridge is an important recreation resource located within of more than 1.5 million people, offering four long-distance hiking trails and over a dozen parks and recreation areas, including several historic sites. It has been the focus of ongoing conservation efforts because of its natural, historic, and recreational value, involving municipal, state, and national agencies and nearly two dozen non-profit organizations.

The Metacomet Ridge extends from <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven</a> and <a href="Branford%2C%20Connecticut">Branford, Connecticut</a> on <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, through the <a href="Connecticut%20River%20Valley">Connecticut River Valley</a> region of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, to northern <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Franklin County, Massachusetts</a>, short of the <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> and <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> borders for a distance of . It is geologically distinct from the nearby <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> and surrounding uplands, and is composed of volcanic <a href="basalt">basalt</a> (also known as "<a href="trap%20rock">trap rock</a>") and <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> in faulted and tilted layers many hundreds of feet thick. In most cases, the basalt layers are dominant, prevalent, and exposed. The ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations, although only above sea level at its highest, with an average summit elevation of .

Visually, the Metacomet Ridge exists as one continuous landscape feature from <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a> at <a href="Branford%2C%20Connecticut">Branford, Connecticut</a> to the end of the <a href="Mount%20Holyoke%20Range">Mount Holyoke Range</a> in <a href="Belchertown%2C%20Massachusetts">Belchertown, Massachusetts</a>, a distance of , broken only by the river gorges of the <a href="Farmington%20River">Farmington River</a> in northern Connecticut and the <a href="Westfield%20River">Westfield</a> and <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a>s in Massachusetts. It was first identified in 1985 as a single geologic feature consisting of <a href="trap%20rock">trap rock</a> by the State Geological and Natural History Survey of Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> extends that definition to include the entire <a href="traprock%20ridge">traprock ridge</a> from Long Island Sound to the <a href="Pocumtuck%20Range">Pocumtuck Range</a> in <a href="Greenfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>. Further complicating the matter is the fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part of the structure of the ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another through Greenfield to nearly the <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.

Until January 2008, the <a href="United%20States%20Board%20on%20Geographic%20Names">United States Board on Geographic Names</a> (USBGN) did not recognize "Metacomet Ridge," "Traprock Ridge" or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as "the traprock ridge" or "the traprock mountains" or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. The <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as "The Traprock Ridge". The name "Metacomet Ridge" was first applied in 1985 in a book published by the Connecticut State Geological Survey, adopting the name from the existing <a href="Metacomet%20Trail">Metacomet Trail</a> along a large portion of the range in central Connecticut.

The name "<a href="Metacomet">Metacomet</a>" or "Metacom" is borrowed from the 17th century <a href="sachem">sachem</a> of the <a href="Wampanoag%20%28tribe%29">Wampanoag Tribe</a> of southern New England who led his people during <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a> in the mid–17th century. Metacomet was also known as King Philip by early New England colonists. A number of features associated with the Metacomet Ridge are named after the sachem, including the Metacomet Trail, the <a href="Metacomet-Monadnock%20Trail">Metacomet-Monadnock Trail</a>, King Philip's Cave, King Philip Mountain, and Sachem Head. According to legend, Metacomet orchestrated the burning of <a href="Simsbury%2C%20Connecticut">Simsbury, Connecticut</a>, and watched the conflagration from <a href="Talcott%20Mountain">Talcott Mountain</a> near the cave now named after him. The names Metacomet and King Philip have been applied to at least sixteen landscape features and over seventy-five businesses, schools, and civic organizations throughout southern New England.

Beginning at <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, the Metacomet Ridge commences as two parallel ridges with related sub-ridges and outcrops in between; the latter include the high <a href="butte">butte</a>–like cliffs of <a href="East%20Rock">East Rock</a> and the isolated peak of <a href="Peter%27s%20Rock">Peter's Rock</a>. The western ridgeline of the Metacomet Ridge begins in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, as <a href="West%20Rock%20Ridge">West Rock Ridge</a> and continues as <a href="Sleeping%20Giant%20%28Connecticut%29">Sleeping Giant</a>, <a href="Mount%20Sanford%20%28Connecticut%29">Mount Sanford</a>, Peck Mountain, and Prospect Ridge, for a distance of before diminishing into a series of low profile outcrops just short of <a href="Southington%2C%20Connecticut">Southington, Connecticut</a>, west of the <a href="Hanging%20Hills">Hanging Hills</a> in Meriden.

To the east, beginning on the rocky prominence of <a href="Beacon%20Hill%20%28Branford%2C%20Connecticut%29">Beacon Hill</a>, , in <a href="Branford%2C%20Connecticut">Branford, Connecticut</a>, overlooking the East Haven River estuary, the Metacomet Ridge continues as a traprock ridge north to <a href="Mount%20Tom%20%28Massachusetts%29">Mount Tom</a> in <a href="Holyoke%2C%20Massachusetts">Holyoke, Massachusetts</a>; it then breaks east across the <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a> to form the <a href="Holyoke%20Range">Holyoke Range</a>, which continues for before terminating in <a href="Belchertown%2C%20Massachusetts">Belchertown, Massachusetts</a>. Several scattered parallel ridges flank it; the most prominent of these are the hills of <a href="Rocky%20Hill%2C%20Connecticut">Rocky Hill, Connecticut</a>, and the <a href="Barn%20Door%20Hills">Barn Door Hills</a> of <a href="Granby%2C%20Connecticut">Granby, Connecticut</a>.

North of Mount Tom and the Holyoke Range, the apparent crest of the Metacomet Ridge is broken by a discontinuity in the once dominant traprock strata. Underlying sedimentary layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the <a href="Pocumtuck%20Ridge">Pocumtuck Ridge</a>, a stretch of , the Metacomet Ridge exists only as a series of mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of sedimentary bedrock. Mount Warner, , in <a href="Hadley%2C%20Massachusetts">Hadley, Massachusetts</a>, the only significant peak in the area, is a geologically unrelated <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a> landform that extends west into the sedimentary strata.

The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on <a href="Sugarloaf%20Mountain%20%28Franklin%20County%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Sugarloaf Mountain</a> and the parallel massif of <a href="Mount%20Toby">Mount Toby</a>, , the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to <a href="Greenfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>. From Greenfield north to short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.

In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is <a href="West%20Peak%20%28New%20Haven%20County%2C%20Connecticut%29">West Peak</a> of the Hanging Hills at ; in Massachusetts, the highest "traprock" peak is Mount Tom, , although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at <a href="Provin%20Mountain">Provin Mountain</a> and <a href="East%20Mountain%20%28Hampden%20County%2C%20Massachusetts%29">East Mountain</a> in Massachusetts where it is less than wide; it is widest at <a href="Totoket%20Mountain">Totoket Mountain</a>, over . However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (<a href="Falls%20River%20%28Connecticut%20River%29">Falls River</a>, <a href="Deerfield%20River">Deerfield River</a>, <a href="Westfield%20River">Westfield River</a>, <a href="Farmington%20River">Farmington River</a>, <a href="Coginchaug%20River">Coginchaug River</a>); and, in southern Connecticut, the <a href="Quinnipiac%20River">Quinnipiac River</a>.

The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, <a href="New%20Britain%2C%20Connecticut">New Britain</a>, <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, and <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a>. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, <a href="Northampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Northampton</a>, <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst</a>, <a href="Holyoke%2C%20Massachusetts">Holyoke</a>, <a href="West%20Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">West Hartford</a>, <a href="Farmington%2C%20Connecticut">Farmington</a>, <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Connecticut">Wallingford</a>, and <a href="Hamden%2C%20Connecticut">Hamden</a>.

The Metacomet Ridge is the result of <a href="rift">continental rifting</a> processes that took place 200 million years ago during the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> and <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> periods. The <a href="basalt">basalt</a> (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive <a href="lava">lava</a> flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> created by the rifting apart of the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n continent from <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric <a href="rift%20valley">rift valley</a> which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.

Basalt is a dark colored <a href="extrusive">extrusive</a> <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a>. The weathering of <a href="iron">iron</a>-bearing minerals within it results in a rusty brown color when exposed to air and water, lending it a distinct reddish or purple–red hue. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique "postpile" appearance. Extensive slopes made of fractured basalt <a href="Scree">talus</a> are visible at the base of many of the cliffs along the Metacomet Ridge.

The basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. <a href="Erosion">Erosion</a> and <a href="Deposition%20%28geology%29">deposition</a> occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows which eventually lithified into <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> layers within the basalt. The resulting "layer cake" of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see <a href="fault-block">fault-block</a>). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today on the western and northern sides of the ridge. Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on <a href="Mount%20Norwottuck">Mount Norwottuck</a> of the <a href="Holyoke%20Range">Holyoke Range</a> in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. <a href="Sugarloaf%20Mountain%20%28Franklin%20County%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Mount Sugarloaf</a>, <a href="Pocumtuck%20Ridge">Pocumtuck Ridge</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Toby">Mount Toby</a>, also in Massachusetts, together present a larger "layer cake" example. The bottom layer is composed of "<a href="arkose">arkose sandstone</a>," visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed of "<a href="basalt">volcanic traprock</a>," most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> known as "Mount Toby Conglomerate." Faulting and <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of traprock, they are part of the Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.

Of all the summits that make up the Metacomet Ridge, <a href="West%20Rock">West Rock</a>, in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, bears special mention because it was not formed by the volcanic flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous <a href="dike%20%28geology%29">volcanic dike</a> through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.

While the traprock cliffs remain the most obvious evidence of the prehistoric "geologic" processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life in the form of Triassic and Jurassic <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s; in particular, <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> tracks. At <a href="Dinosaur%20State%20Park%20and%20Arboretum">a state park</a> in <a href="Rocky%20Hill%2C%20Connecticut">Rocky Hill, Connecticut</a>, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.

 The Metacomet Ridge hosts a combination of <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a>s unusual to the region. Dry, hot upper ridges support <a href="oak%20savanna">oak savanna</a>s, often dominated by <a href="chestnut%20oak">chestnut oak</a> and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. <a href="Juniperus%20virginiana">Eastern red-cedar</a>, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachians</a>, containing species common to the <a href="northern%20hardwood%20forest">northern hardwood</a> and <a href="oak-hickory%20forest">oak-hickory forest</a> ecosystem types. <a href="Tsuga%20canadensis">Eastern hemlock</a> crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a> habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the <a href="opuntia">prickly pear cactus</a>, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="Agkistrodon%20contortrix%20mokasen">northern copperhead</a>, <a href="Cypripedium%20reginae">showy lady's slipper</a>, <a href="Corydalis%20lutea">yellow corydalis</a>, <a href="Cypripedium%20arietinum">ram's–head lady's slipper</a>, <a href="Pycnanthemum%20clinopodioides">basil mountain mint</a>, and <a href="Chamaelirium">devil's bit lily</a>.

The Metacomet Ridge is also an important <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>. It provides municipalities and towns with public drinking water; reservoirs are located on <a href="Talcott%20Mountain">Talcott Mountain</a>, <a href="Totoket%20Mountain">Totoket Mountain</a>, <a href="Saltonstall%20Mountain">Saltonstall Mountain</a>, <a href="Bradley%20Mountain">Bradley Mountain</a>, Ragged Mountain, and the Hanging Hills in Connecticut. Reservoirs that supply metropolitan <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>, are located on Provin Mountain and East Mountain.

<a href="Native%20Americans%20%28United%20States%29">Native Americans</a> occupied the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge for at least 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the <a href="Quinnipiac">Quinnipiac</a>, <a href="Niantic%20%28tribe%29">Niantic</a>, <a href="Pequot">Pequot</a>, <a href="Pocomtuc">Pocomtuc</a>, and <a href="Mohegan">Mohegan</a>. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as <a href="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="Squash%20%28plant%29">squash</a>, <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>, and <a href="bean">bean</a>s.
Natives incorporated the natural features of the ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting the course of the <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a> where it suddenly swings east in <a href="Middletown%2C%20Connecticut">Middletown, Connecticut</a>, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating <a href="beaver">beaver</a> who lived in a great lake that existed in the <a href="Connecticut%20River%20Valley">Connecticut River Valley</a> of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the <a href="Sleeping%20Giant%20%28Connecticut%29">Sleeping Giant</a>, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial <a href="Lake%20Hitchcock">Lake Hitchcock</a>, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, "<a href="Castoroides">Castoroides ohioensis</a>", that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.

<a href="European%20ethnic%20groups">Europeans</a> began settling the river valleys around the Metacomet Ridge in the mid–17th century. Forests were cut down or burned to make room for agriculture, resulting in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 19th century. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable for planting crops, was widely harvested of timber as a result of the expanding <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> industry that boomed before the mining of <a href="coal">coal</a> from the mid–Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing. Traprock was harvested from <a href="Scree">talus</a> slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations; copper ore was discovered at the base of <a href="Peak%20Mountain">Peak Mountain</a> in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at <a href="Old%20Newgate%20Prison">Old Newgate Prison</a> located there.

With the advent of <a href="industrialization">industrialization</a> in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force expanded in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded the ridges. Traprock and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for paving stones and architectural <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a>, either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.

Increased urbanization and industrialization in Europe and North America resulted in an opposing aesthetic <a href="transcendentalism">transcendentalist</a> movement characterized in New England by the art of <a href="Thomas%20Cole">Thomas Cole</a>, <a href="Frederic%20Edwin%20Church">Frederic Edwin Church</a>, and other <a href="Hudson%20River%20School">Hudson River School</a> painters, the work of landscape architects such as <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, and the writings of philosophers such as <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>. As was true of other scenic areas of New England, the philosophical, artistic, and environmental movement of transcendentalism transformed the Metacomet Ridge from a commercial resource to a recreational resource. Hotels, parks, and summer estates were built on the mountains from the mid-1880s to the early 20th century. Notable structures included summit hotels and inns on <a href="Mount%20Holyoke">Mount Holyoke</a>, <a href="Mount%20Tom%20%28Massachusetts%29">Mount Tom</a>, <a href="Sugarloaf%20Mountain%20%28Franklin%20County%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Sugarloaf Mountain</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Nonotuck">Mount Nonotuck</a>. Parks and park structures such as <a href="Poet%27s%20Seat">Poet's Seat</a> in <a href="Greenfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="Hubbard%20Park%20%28Meriden%2C%20Connecticut%29">Hubbard Park</a> (designed with the help of Frederick Law Olmsted) of the <a href="Hanging%20Hills">Hanging Hills</a> of Meriden, Connecticut, were intended as respites from the urban areas they closely abutted. Estates such as <a href="Hill-Stead">Hill-Stead</a> and <a href="Heublein%20Tower">Heublein Tower</a> were built as mountain home retreats by local industrialists and commercial investors. Although public attention gradually shifted to more remote and less developed destinations with the advent of modern transportation and the westward expansion of the United States, the physical, cultural, and historic legacy of that early recreational interest in the Metacomet Ridge still supports modern conservation efforts. Estates became museums; old hotels and the lands they occupied, frequently subject to damaging fires, became state and municipal parkland through philanthropic donation, purchase, or confiscation for unpaid taxes. Nostalgia among former guests of hotels and estates contributed to the aesthetic of conservation.

Interest in mountains as places to build recreational footpaths took root in New England with organizations such as the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountain%20Club">Appalachian Mountain Club</a>, the <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Club">Green Mountain Club</a>, the <a href="Appalachian%20Trail%20Conservancy">Appalachian Trail Conference</a>, and the <a href="Connecticut%20Forest%20and%20Park%20Association">Connecticut Forest and Park Association</a>. Following the pioneering effort of the Green Mountain Club in the inauguration of Vermont's <a href="Long%20Trail">Long Trail</a> in 1918, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, spearheaded by Edgar Laing Heermance, created the <a href="Quinnipiac%20Trail">Quinnipiac Trail</a> on the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut in 1928 and soon followed it up with the <a href="Metacomet%20Trail">Metacomet Trail</a> along the Metacomet Ridge in central and northern Connecticut. More than of "blue blaze trails" in Connecticut were completed by the association by the end of the 20th century. While the focus of the Appalachian Mountain Club was geared primarily toward the <a href="White%20Mountains%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">White Mountains</a> of New Hampshire in its early years, as club membership broadened, so did interest in the areas closer to club members' homes. In the late 1950s, the <a href="Metacomet-Monadnock%20Trail">Metacomet-Monadnock Trail</a> was laid out by the Berkshire Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club under leadership of Professor Walter M. Banfield of the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. The trail follows the Metacomet Ridge for the first one–third of its length. Overall, trailbuilding had a pro-active effect on conservation awareness by thrusting portions of the Metacomet Ridge into the public consciousness.

Although the Metacomet Ridge has abutted significant urban areas for nearly two hundred years, because of its rugged, steep, and rocky terrain, the ridge was long considered an undesirable place to build a home except for those wealthy enough to afford such a luxury. However, <a href="suburbanization">suburbanization</a> through <a href="urban%20exodus">urban exodus</a> and <a href="Effects%20of%20the%20automobile%20on%20societies">automobile culture</a>, and modern construction techniques and equipment have created a demand for homes on and around the once undeveloped Metacomet Ridge and its surrounding <a href="exurban">exurban</a> communities. As of 2007, the metropolitan areas bordering the range—<a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven</a>, <a href="Meriden%2C%20Connecticut">Meriden</a>, <a href="New%20Britain%2C%20Connecticut">New Britain</a>, <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a> and <a href="Greenfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Greenfield</a>—had a combined population of more than 2.5 million people. Populations in exurban towns around the range in Connecticut have increased 7.6 percent between the mid-1990s to 2000, and building permits increased 26 percent in the same period. Considered an attractive place to build homes because of its views and proximity to urban centers and highways, the Metacomet Ridge has become a target for both developers and advocates of <a href="Conservation%20movement">land conservation</a>. Quarrying, supported by the increased need for stone in local and regional construction projects, has been especially damaging to the ecosystem, public access, and visual landscape of the ridge. At the same time, the boom in interest in outdoor recreation in the latter 20th century has made the Metacomet Ridge an attractive "active leisure" resource. In response to public interest in the ridge and its surrounding landscapes, more than twenty local non-profit organizations have become involved in conservation efforts on and around the ridge and surrounding region. Most of these organizations came into being between 1970 and 2000, and nearly all of them have evidenced a marked increase in conservation activity since 1990. Several international and national organizations have also become interested in the Metacomet Ridge, including <a href="The%20Nature%20Conservancy">The Nature Conservancy</a>, the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, and the <a href="Trust%20for%20Public%20Land">Trust for Public Land</a>.

 Steepness, long cliff–top views, and proximity to urban areas make the Metacomet Ridge a significant regional outdoor recreation resource. The ridge is traversed by more than of long-distance and shorter <a href="hiking">hiking</a> trails.

Museums, historic sites, <a href="interpretive%20centre">interpretive centers</a>, and other attractions can be found on or near the Metacomet Ridge; some offer outdoor concerts, celebrations, and festivals.

Because of its narrowness, proximity to urban areas, and fragile ecosystems, the Metacomet Ridge is most endangered by encroaching <a href="suburban%20sprawl">suburban sprawl</a>. <a href="Quarry">Quarry</a> operations, also a threat, have obliterated several square miles of traprock ridgeline in both Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Development and quarrying threats to the Metacomet Ridge have resulted in public open space acquisition efforts through collective purchasing and fundraising, active solicitation of land donations, securing of <a href="conservation%20easement">conservation easement</a>s, protective and restrictive legislation agreements limiting development, and, in a few cases, land taking by <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a>.

Stanley Goble

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Stanley James (Jimmy) Goble, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DSC</a> (21 August 1891 – 24 July 1948) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He served three terms as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, alternating with Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>. Goble came to national attention in 1924 when he and fellow RAAF pilot <a href="Ivor%20McIntyre">Ivor McIntyre</a> became the first men to <a href="Circumnavigation">circumnavigate</a> Australia by air, journeying in a single-engined <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>.

During World War I, Goble flew <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with the British <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a>. He became an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a> with ten victories, commanded No. 5 Squadron (later <a href="No.%20205%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 205 Squadron RAF</a>), and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. Returning to Australia, Goble assisted in the formation of the RAAF as an independent branch of the Australian armed forces. On an exchange posting to Britain in the 1930s, he led <a href="No.%202%20Group%20RAF">No. 2 (Bomber) Group RAF</a>.

As Chief of the Air Staff at the onset of World War II, Goble clashed with the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Federal Government</a> over implementation of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, which he believed would be detrimental to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and spent the rest of the war in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> as <a href="Air%20Liaison%20Officer">Air Liaison Officer</a> to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after retiring from the military.

Born in <a href="Croydon%2C%20Victoria">Croydon</a>, Victoria, Stanley James Goble was one of four sons to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann. He apparently received little schooling, and began his working life as a <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a> with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen. By twenty-three he was, like his father, a stationmaster, and a footballer with <a href="Brunswick%20Football%20Club">Brunswick</a> in the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20Association">Victorian Football Association</a>.

Goble was prevented from joining the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> at the beginning of World War I after failing the stringent medical criteria; he wrote later that "only applicants of the finest physiques were considered suitable for the first contingent of Australian troops". With his three brothers already on active service, he decided to travel to England at his own expense and enlist in the British armed forces.

Goble was accepted for flying training with the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> (RNAS) in July 1915. After graduating as a flight sub-lieutenant on 20 October 1915, he became a test pilot and undertook <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> out of <a href="Dover">Dover</a>. Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience. Towards the end of the year he was posted across the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> to <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, flying <a href="Caudron">Caudron</a> reconnaissance-bombers and <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> fighters.

Goble was a founding member of <a href="No.%20208%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 8 Squadron RNAS</a> in 1916, during the latter part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, where he flew both Pups and <a href="Nieuport">Nieuport</a> fighters. He earned the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> for his actions on 24 September 1916 when he engaged two enemy fighters near <a href="Gistel">Ghistelles</a> in <a href="West%20Flanders">West Flanders</a>, "and brought one of them down on fire in a spiral nose-dive". This victory was the first confirmed "kill" achieved by an Allied pilot flying the Pup. Goble was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 October, and won the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre">French Croix de guerre</a> later that month.

On 17 February 1917, Goble was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) for his "conspicuous bravery and skill" in three separate actions while operating with No. 8 Squadron: on 7 November 1916 when he forced a hostile fighter down in a field, where it crashed attempting to land; on 27 November when he engaged four enemy aircraft, destroying one; and on 4 December when, in repeated combats while escorting Allied bombers, he helped drive off attacking fighters and shot down one of them. The same month that he was awarded the DSO, Goble was posted to <a href="No.%20205%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 5 Squadron RNAS</a> at <a href="Petite-Synthe">Petite-Synthe</a> near the Franco-Belgian border, flying <a href="Airco%20DH.4">Airco DH.4</a> two-seat light bombers.

Goble was promoted twice in 1917, to flight commander in June, then squadron commander in December. He led No. 5 Squadron for the latter part of the year and into 1918. His unit supported the <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Fifth Army</a> as it bore the brunt of the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, and he had to evacuate his airfield when it was shelled by advancing enemy artillery. Relocating twice to other landing grounds, he kept his squadron on the attack, and was subsequently recognised by a commendation circulated to all RNAS combat units. When the RNAS merged with the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>'s <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> on 1 April 1918, Goble became a <a href="major">major</a> in the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. Twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, he finished the war an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>, with ten victories. Although himself forced to crash land on two occasions, he had avoided any injury during his active service.

Goble returned to Australia on HT "Gaika" in November 1918. He was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1919%20New%20Year%20Honours">1919 New Year Honours</a>, and made an acting <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in May that year. He received a permanent commission as a <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and honorary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in the RAF on 1 August 1919, and was seconded to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>.

When a temporary Air Board was set up to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, an <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> veteran of World War I, acting as an <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> spokesman. The permanent <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of the armed services. The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921—the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later—and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a wing commander.

The Navy had nominated Goble as First Air Member (later <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>), but Williams took the post and Goble became Second Air Member and Director of Personnel and Training. Williams and Goble would serve as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) three times each between 1922 and 1940. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to limit Williams' autonomy. Instead, according to RAAF historian Alan Stephens, the arrangement "almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry" between the two officers, which was "exacerbated by the personality differences between the pedantic, autocratic Williams and the cheerful, easy-going Goble". Although in a legal sense the Air Board led the RAAF rather than the CAS alone, Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.

The rivalry between Goble and Williams was such that it was later alleged that government practice was to ensure that they were never in the country at the same time. In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain for a naval co-operation course; his place on the Air Board was taken by Squadron Leader <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>. Goble married Kathleen Wodehouse in London on <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a>, 1922, and returned to Australia later that year. His first term as CAS began when Williams left the country in December 1922 for study in England. Goble developed a plan to establish a small <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base at <a href="Rushcutters%20Bay">Rushcutters Bay</a> in Sydney, but Williams cancelled this shortly after he returned to Australia in February 1925 to resume the position of CAS. Goble's suggestion of a separate <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> fostered suspicions that he was too closely aligned with naval interests. He departed for England to undertake study at the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">British Army Staff College in Camberley</a> and <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, as Williams had done two years before. Goble also served as Air Liaison Officer with the Australian High Commission in London from May 1926 to September 1927. He was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> on 1 April 1928.

Raised to temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, Goble took over as CAS for the second time between December 1932 and June 1934, while Williams attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in London. On secondment to the RAF from 1935 to 1937, Goble was attached to the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> as Deputy Director of Air Operations. In this capacity he attended a conference in 1936 to examine a Commonwealth-wide air training plan, a concept that would be revived in World War II as the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. Continuing his exchange posting, on 1 September Goble took over as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="No.%202%20Group%20RAF">No. 2 (Bomber) Group</a>, based in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. The group comprised fifteen squadrons, putting him in charge of a force stronger than the entire RAAF. On 28 February 1937, Goble was raised to temporary <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>. He succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time in February 1939, when the latter was dismissed from his position in the aftermath of the <a href="Edward%20Leonard%20Ellington">Ellington Report</a> criticising the standards of training and air safety observed by the RAAF. When he replaced Williams, Goble was <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a> and might therefore have been considered more closely responsible for such standards; he maintained that Williams had personally overseen the service's air training since 1934.

The young air force was a small, close-knit organisation comparable to a <a href="flying%20club">flying club</a>, although several pioneering flights were undertaken by its members. One of the most notable was made by Goble and Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) <a href="Ivor%20McIntyre">Ivor McIntyre</a> in 1924, when they became the first men to circumnavigate Australia by air, in a single-engined <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>D floatplane. The English-born McIntyre, who was lead pilot while Goble acted as commander and navigator, was also a World War I veteran of the Royal Naval Air Service. The purpose of the flight was to survey the northern coastline of Australia for defence planning, and to test the capabilities of the Fairey IIID.

Goble and McIntyre took off from <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, on 6 April 1924 and flew in 44 days, in often arduous conditions. Though well-prepared with fuel stocks and spare parts pre-positioned along the intended route, they had to contend with illness and tropical storms, as well as mid-air engine trouble and fuel leaks. Their journey took them anticlockwise around the continent, along the Eastern Australian coast through Sydney, <a href="Southport%2C%20Queensland">Southport</a>, <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a> and <a href="Thursday%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Thursday Island</a>, crossing the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, and then continuing along the coast through <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome</a>, <a href="Carnarvon%2C%20Western%20Australia">Carnarvon</a>, <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> and <a href="Port%20Lincoln%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Lincoln</a>, before arriving back in Victoria. As they flew above Point Cook, twelve RAAF aircraft took to the air to escort them to their landing place at <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria">St Kilda Beach</a>, where they were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 people.
Prime Minister <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a> called the expedition "one of the most wonderful accomplishments in the history of aviation", his government presenting Goble with a gift of £500, and £250 to McIntyre. The British <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a> awarded them the annual <a href="Britannia%20Trophy">Britannia Trophy</a>, and they were appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commanders of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a>. Though the flight is still acknowledged as one of the most important in Australian aviation, the necessity for the Air Force chief to personally command such a journey has been questioned, suggesting that it was motivated by the <a href="one-upmanship">one-upmanship</a> that characterised the Williams-Goble relationship. Two years later Williams would make a three-month, round trip from Point Cook to the Pacific Islands, the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew, amid similar suspicions.

As Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of World War II, Goble planned the expansion and decentralisation of the RAAF to meet the needs of home defence and Australia's obligations in Europe, which included the transfer of <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a> to Britain. The Federal Government abandoned his concept of an autonomous Air Expeditionary Force in favour of full commitment to the Empire Air Training Scheme, which Goble considered detrimental to local defence. His proposal to organise the RAAF along functional lines, with Home Defence, Training, and Maintenance Commands, would similarly be rejected. He also came into conflict with his deputy, Air Commodore John Russell, an RAF officer on exchange in Australia. These issues led to Goble tendering his resignation as CAS, which took effect in January 1940. "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Australia%29">The Argus</a>" in Melbourne reported that "Goble wishes to resign 'on a matter of high principle'. It is known that he has been dissatisfied for some time with his relations with the Federal Government."

Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> had in any case been looking for a British officer to head the RAAF and confided to the <a href="List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Australia">UK High Commissioner</a>, Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, that Goble's resignation was "undoubtedly very convenient". Following the interim appointment of Air Commodore Anderson, the Royal Air Force's Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a> became Chief of the Air Staff; among other things, Burnett proceeded to reorganise the Air Force into a geographically based <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">"area" system</a> of command and control. Goble had offered to submit his resignation from the RAAF as well as from the position of CAS, and was considering a return to Britain for service with the RAF. Menzies persuaded him to remain and take on the role of Australian Air Liaison Officer to Canada, based in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. Raised to substantive air vice marshal, Goble stayed at this post for the duration of the war and was the RAAF's representative at the Ottawa Conference in May–June 1942 that negotiated the Joint Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

In January 1946, Goble presided over the <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> of Australia's top-scoring fighter ace, Group Captain <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>. Charged with alcohol trafficking on the island of <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in 1945, Caldwell was found guilty and reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; he left the Air Force soon after. Goble was himself forced into retirement in February 1946, despite being five years below the mandatory age of sixty. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, in recommending Goble's dismissal, wrote that "this officer has a sound Service knowledge and an alert mind, but suffers from certain nervous characteristics which make continuous application to a task impossible". Other senior RAAF commanders who were veterans of World War I, including Richard Williams, were also retired at this time, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger officers.

Goble suffered from hypertensive <a href="cerebrovascular%20disease">cerebrovascular disease</a> and died in <a href="Heidelberg%2C%20Victoria">Heidelberg</a>, Victoria, on 24 July 1948. He was cremated, leaving his wife Kathleen, and three sons. His son John (born 1923) joined the Royal Australian Navy and qualified as a pilot in the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a>, rising to the rank of <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">commodore</a> and commanding <a href="817%20Squadron%20RAN">817 Squadron</a>, the naval air station <a href="HMAS%20Albatross%20%28air%20station%29">HMAS "Albatross"</a>, and the aircraft carrier <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%28R21%29">HMAS "Melbourne"</a>. Goble Street in <a href="Hughes%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Hughes</a>, Australian Capital Territory, was named for Jimmy Goble. In 1994 he and Ivor McIntyre were honoured with the issue of a postage stamp by <a href="Australia%20Post">Australia Post</a>, in a series depicting Australian aviators that also included <a href="Freda%20Thompson">Freda Thompson</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Hargrave">Lawrence Hargrave</a>, and Sir <a href="Keith%20Macpherson%20Smith">Keith</a> and Sir <a href="Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith">Ross Macpherson Smith</a>.

British logistics in the Falklands War

The 1982 <a href="Falklands%20War">British military campaign to recapture</a> the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> depended on complex logistical arrangements. The logistical difficulties of operating from home were formidable. The Argentine <a href="1982%20invasion%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">invasion of the Falkland Islands</a> came at a time when the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s amphibious capability was being run down; but it still possessed two <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, and , two <a href="landing%20platform%20dock">landing platform dock</a> (LPD) ships, and , and six <a href="landing%20ship%20logistics">landing ship logistics</a> (LSL) ships. To provide the necessary logistic support, the Royal Navy's ships were augmented by ships taken up from trade (<a href="STUFT">STUFT</a>).

The <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and Royal Navy developed a base at <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a>, a British territory in the mid-Atlantic from the UK and from the Falkland Islands. Although it had an airfield with an excellent runway, there was only a small <a href="hardstand">hardstand</a> area for parking aircraft and no parallel taxiways. There was an <a href="anchorage%20%28maritime%29">anchorage</a>, but no port facilities—just a lone <a href="jetty">jetty</a>. Ascension was used as a convenient place for the amphibious ships to re-stow their equipment, and as a base for <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Hercules</a> transport aircraft, which were modified by the addition of auxiliary fuel tanks and <a href="aerial%20refuelling">aerial refuelling</a> probes. With the support of <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Victor</a> tankers, these modifications allowed the transports to deliver priority supplies to the South Atlantic.

The <a href="3rd%20Commando%20Brigade">3rd Commando Brigade</a> <a href="Operation%20Sutton">landed</a> at <a href="Ajax%20Bay">Ajax Bay</a>, <a href="Port%20San%20Carlos">Port San Carlos</a> and <a href="San%20Carlos%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">San Carlos</a> on <a href="East%20Falkland">East Falkland</a>, but struggled to build up its supplies as the Argentine air forces made <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Carlos%20%281982%29">repeated attacks on ships</a> in Falkland Sound. was struck by a missile, and sank with three <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook">Chinook</a> and six <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Wessex</a> helicopters still on board, along with their tools and spare parts, and other vital stores including tent accommodation. The loss of the helicopters on "Atlantic Conveyor" was a serious blow; it forced the 3rd Commando Brigade to make a <a href="loaded%20march">loaded march</a> across East Falkland. The Brigade Maintenance Area (BMA) was struck by an Argentine air attack on 27 May that destroyed hundreds of rounds of mortar and artillery ammunition. Forward Brigade Maintenance Areas (FBMAs) were established at <a href="Teal%20Inlet">Teal Inlet</a> for the 3rd Commando Brigade and <a href="Fitzroy%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Fitzroy</a> for the <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Infantry Brigade</a>. Some 500 rounds per gun were delivered to gun positions by helicopters to enable the <a href="artillery">artillery</a> to support the attacks on the mountains ringing <a href="Port%20Stanley">Port Stanley</a>. The successful conclusion of these battles resulted in the surrender of the Argentine forces in the Falklands on 14 June.

Tensions between Britain and Argentina over the disputed <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> (Malvinas) rose swiftly after Argentine scrap metal merchants and <a href="Argentina%20Marines">Argentina Marines</a> raised the Argentine flag over <a href="South%20Georgia%20Island">South Georgia Island</a> on 19 March 1982, and on 2 April, Argentine forces <a href="1982%20invasion%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">occupied the Falkland Islands</a>. The British government had already taken some action on 29 March, ordering the submarines and to sail for the South Atlantic. "Spartan" left <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 1 April, and "Splendid" sailed from <a href="Faslane">Faslane</a> the same day. A third submarine, followed on 4 April.

The <a href="Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a> (RFA) <a href="stores%20ship">stores ship</a> was despatched from the Western Mediterranean to replenish the only British warship in the South Atlantic, the patrol vessel , which was down to its last three weeks' supplies. The <a href="replenishment%20oiler">tanker</a> , which had left <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a> bound for the United Kingdom with a full load of fuel, received orders on 27 March to divert to Gibraltar, embark stores there, and join "Endurance" and "Fort Austin" in the South Atlantic.

When intelligence was received in London on 31 March that the Falklands would be invaded on 2 April, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, and the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, <a href="John%20Nott">John Nott</a>, instructed the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, <a href="Admiral%20of%20the%20Fleet%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral of the Fleet</a> Sir <a href="Henry%20Leach">Henry Leach</a>, to ready a force to recapture the islands. The <a href="Commander-in-Chief%20Fleet">Commander-in-Chief Fleet</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="John%20Fieldhouse">John Fieldhouse</a>, who was based at <a href="Northwood%20Headquarters">Northwood Headquarters</a>, was placed in command of Task Force 317, with overall responsibility for this operation, codenamed Operation Corporate. <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir <a href="John%20Curtiss">John Curtiss</a> was appointed air component commander, and Major General <a href="Jeremy%20Moore">Jeremy Moore</a>, land component commander.

<a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Sandy%20Woodward">Sandy Woodward</a> commanded the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> battle group (TG 317.8); <a href="Commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Michael%20Clapp">Michael Clapp</a>, the <a href="Commodore%2C%20Amphibious%20Warfare">Commodore, Amphibious Warfare</a>, commanded the amphibious force (TG 317.0); and <a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Brigadier</a> <a href="Julian%20Thompson%20%28Royal%20Marines%20officer%29">Julian Thompson</a>, the landing force (TG 317.1). Thompson's force was built around his <a href="3rd%20Commando%20Brigade">3rd Commando Brigade</a>, which had three battalions of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> (<a href="40%20Commando">40 Commando</a>, <a href="42%20Commando">42 Commando</a> and <a href="45%20Commando">45 Commando</a>), and supporting units including its own logistic support unit, the <a href="Commando%20Logistic%20Regiment">Commando Logistic Regiment</a>. About 80 per cent of the Commando Logistic Regiment's men were Royal Marines; the rest came from the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

On 2 April, orders went out to make the Royal Navy's two aircraft carriers, and , ready to sail. Both had been involved in exercises in February and March, and were at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">HMNB Portsmouth</a> for six weeks' maintenance. Many of "Hermes"s major systems had been dismantled for the maintenance work. "Invincible" was in a better state of readiness, but her crew were on leave. The Royal Navy's two <a href="landing%20platform%20dock">landing platform dock</a> (LPD) ships, and , were also at Portsmouth, where the former was acting as an officer training ship and the latter was being mothballed, having been <a href="paid%20off">paid off</a>. She was hastily recommissioned, and her crew reassembled from their new postings. Each LPD carried four <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Utility">Landing Craft Utility</a> (LCU) in its dock, and four of the smaller <a href="LCVP%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel</a> (LCVP) on <a href="davit">davit</a>s.

The rest of the Royal Navy's amphibious capability consisted of six <a href="Round%20Table%20class%20landing%20ship%20logistics%20ship">Round Table class</a> <a href="landing%20ship%20logistics">landing ship logistics</a> (LSL) ships. Four were immediately available: and were at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">HMNB Devonport</a>, while and were at the <a href="Marchwood%20Military%20Port">Marchwood Military Port</a>. The other two were further away: was in Belize, and could meet up with the fleet on its way south; but was in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada, and would not be immediately available. It was therefore decided to use the stores ship , which was also in reserve at Portsmouth, as an LPD in the initial stages, after which she would revert to her normal role. "Stromness" departed on 7 April with 358 Royal Marines and 7,500 rations on board.
As vital as they were, these ships were insufficient for the logistics needs of a task force operating from home. Civilian ships could be obtained by charter or by requisition; but there was no time to allow ships to complete the deliveries of their cargo or meet their existing passenger booking obligations. The British government therefore resorted to requisitioning, a practice last exercised during the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> in 1956. An <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> was issued on 4 April allowing any British ship to be requisitioned, along with anything on board. Civilian ships acquired became known as ships taken up from trade (<a href="STUFT">STUFT</a>). Half were requisitioned; the rest were chartered. Some companies, such as <a href="P%26amp%3BO%20%28company%29">P&O</a>, insisted on requisitioning, as it allowed them to break existing contracts.

Government policy was that only British-flagged vessels could be requisitioned, and only British nationals could serve as crewmen. British crewmen were retained, and a 150 per cent bonus was paid to those who entered the South Atlantic, considerably more than the extra £1 per day paid to members of the armed services. Among the RFA crews were some 400 Hong Kong Chinese, who were <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories%20citizen">British Overseas Territories citizen</a>s. Some protested that their contracts said nothing about service in a war zone, but the Ministry of Defence refuted this. A declaration of active service brought everyone under the <a href="Naval%20Discipline%20Act%201957">Naval Discipline Act 1957</a>. A senior naval officer was assigned to each ship, with authority to direct the ship's actions and movements, even if, in the opinion of the master, it might put the ship at risk.

Many modern ships are designed for maximum economy in performing a specific task, which limits their flexibility. The ferries that plied the English Channel, for example, did not have the capacity to store enough fresh water for a voyage to the South Atlantic. STUFT had to have a combination of range, endurance and <a href="sea-keeping">sea-keeping</a> qualities. The need for range meant that ships could not take on sea water as <a href="ballast">ballast</a>, making them less stable in the rough seas anticipated in the South Atlantic. Only one vessel was taken up for every four inspected. Over the next few months, 54 ships were requisitioned from 33 owners. During the Falklands War they carried of freight, 95 aircraft, 9,000 personnel, and of fuel.

On 3 April it was decided to add the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (3 Para) to Thompson's 3rd Commando Brigade. This ended plans for the amphibious force to carry the entire landing force. Even if troops were accommodated on the aircraft carriers, they could not carry what was now a 4,350-man force. Calculations indicated that capacity was short by 1,700 men, of stores and 60 vehicles. For a troop transport, an <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> was the best alternative, but there were few of these left. P&O's was chosen. She was on a cruise in the Mediterranean with a full complement of passengers and crew, but due to return to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> on 6 April. Some 400 of her crew were Asian nationals, and therefore had to be disembarked, but her master, Captain D. J. Scott-Masson, was a <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a> officer.
The <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> subsequently recommended further reinforcing the 3rd Commando Brigade with another battalion, the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (2 Para). This was approved by the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> on 15 April. To carry it, the ferry was requisitioned on 17 April. She was far from ideal, as her ramp could not be lowered to the height of the <a href="mexeflote">mexeflote</a> landing rafts carried by the LSLs, but the choices of available ships were limited. For transporting vehicles, a <a href="roll-on/roll-off">roll-on/roll-off</a> vessel was preferred, as unloading facilities were unavailable in the Falkland Islands. The P&O ferry MS "Elk" was therefore requisitioned. It took on 100 vehicles, 2,000 tons of ammunition, and several hundred tons of stores. It was followed by the MS "Europic Ferry", which was taken up on 19 April. Cunard's <a href="container%20ship">container ship</a>, was requisitioned on 14 April and converted into an aircraft transport.

Soon after his appointment as land component commander on 9 April, Moore began to press for British Army's <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Infantry Brigade</a> to be sent to the South Atlantic as well. Fieldhouse formally requested this on 27 April. The brigade had a strength of 3,961 men, and for 35 days' operations it required of ammunition, of stores, 205 vehicles and 19 helicopters. If the ships carrying the 3rd Commando Brigade were to be reused, even if the troops were flown to <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a> and embarked from there, they could not reach the Falkland Islands before the middle of June. It was therefore decided that the brigade would have to be carried in other ships. The War Cabinet only approved the despatch of the 5th Infantry Brigade on 2 May. The <a href="Cunard%20Line">Cunard Line</a>'s was taken up just 19 hours before she was due to depart for the Mediterranean with cruise passengers.

To carry the 5th Infantry Brigade's vehicles and stores, two more roll-on/roll-off vessels were requisitioned, the and . "Atlantic Conveyor"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, , was requisitioned for the same conversion to an aircraft transport on 4 May. They were joined by the helicopter support ship . "Atlantic Causeway" was loaded with vehicles and stores, requiring another vessel to carry the aircraft. It had also been decided to send another six RAF Harriers to augment the six already sent on "Atlantic Conveyor". <a href="RFA%20Argus%20%28A135%29">MV "Contender Bezant"</a>, was requisitioned for conversion to an aircraft transport on 10 May, followed by <a href="RFA%20Reliant%20%28A131%29">"Astronomer"</a> on 29 May.

Fuel was a critical requirement of the task force, and for political reasons could not be obtained from South America or South Africa. Countries in South America, even if sympathetic, felt unable to offer overt support in a conflict involving a neighbouring state, while South Africa was an international pariah at the time due to its system of <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, and collaboration with its regime risked alienating other countries at a time when Britain needed all the support it could muster for its international diplomatic efforts. The nearest source of supply was <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> in Sierra Leone, from the Falkland Islands. To carry the <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel fuel</a> required by the <a href="gas%20turbine">gas turbine</a>s of the warships and the <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> required by "Hermes" and some of the older RFA and STUFT, the fourteen RFA tankers were supplemented by fifteen requisitioned tankers.

Although the Royal Navy ships in the task force were fitted with <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> systems for producing <a href="potable%20water">potable water</a>, many civilian ships were not, and some ships needed more water than usual owing to their carrying additional passengers. The SS "Fort Toronto" was chartered from <a href="CP%20Ships">Canadian Pacific</a> for service as a water tanker. The supply of water while under way was simpler than fuel, as the hoses are lighter and the quantities involved are not as great. The North Sea oil rig support ship SS "Stena Seaspread" was taken up to act as a repair ship. The <a href="Royal%20Maritime%20Auxiliary%20Service">Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service</a> had one ocean-going <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>, , but it was evident that more would be required, and three were requisitioned from the United Towing company: SS "Salvageman", "Irishman" and "Yorkshireman".

The Royal Navy had no hospital ships. had been built to allow its conversion into a hospital ship, but she required special fuel oil, and had only a 200-bed capacity. Instead, the P&O liner , which was in the Mediterranean on an educational cruise with a thousand schoolchildren on board, was requisitioned, and modified to become a hospital ship. A team of 135 medical personnel was assigned, which included members of <a href="Queen%20Alexandra%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Nursing%20Service">Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service</a> (QARNNS). This was the first time that QARNNS personnel had been deployed afloat since the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. They brought a packaged 250-bed portable hospital and 90 tons of medical supplies with them. Beds were provided for 20 intensive care patients and 94 medium dependency patients. Up to 940 low dependency patients could be accommodated in dormitories. Three s, , and , became ambulance ships.

Hospital ships were exempt from attack under the <a href="Geneva%20Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a>, but they also require that patients not be returned directly to the battlefield after treatment. Due to the distances involved, this meant that treatment on "Uganda" would involve a prolonged absence, even those with relatively minor injuries that were anticipated such as <a href="trench%20foot">trench foot</a>. Additional medical facilities were therefore established elsewhere in the task force. Surgical teams were also embarked on "Hermes", "Fearless" and "Canberra". In addition to the British Army medical staff embarked, there were 425 Royal Navy medical staff with the task force, including 103 doctors. Some 40 Royal Naval Reserve doctors were called up for service in the UK to replace those headed for the South Atlantic. The departure of so many trained personnel led to the suspension of nursing training at the <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20Haslar">Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar</a>, and <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Hospital%2C%20Stonehouse">Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse</a>. The Army Blood Supply Depot issued 800 units to the task force, and more units were obtained from a blood donation drive on "Canberra".

It was initially hoped that ships could be loaded and converted at commercial shipyards, but these were soon overwhelmed by the requirements for skilled labour and specialised facilities, and the burden fell on the <a href="Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard">Royal Navy Dockyard</a>s at Portsmouth, Devonport, <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham</a>, <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland</a>, <a href="Rosyth%20Dockyard">Rosyth</a> and <a href="Gibdock">Gibraltar</a>. These had been subject to cutbacks; redundancy notices had been issued at Portsmouth on 2 April, and Chatham and Gibraltar had been slated for closure. Along with Marchwood, the home of the Army's <a href="17%20Port%20and%20Maritime%20Regiment%20RLC">17 Port Regiment</a> and the home base of the six LSLs, they were not bound by legal limits on the handling of explosives. Marchwood had only a single jetty, capable of accepting two ships, and could not accept deep draft vessels. Most major ship conversions were carried out at Devonport. Portsmouth carried out seven major conversions, including "Norland", and fourteen minor ones, of which ten were tankers. These were the simplest conversions, as all they involved was installing communications equipment and <a href="replenishment%20at%20sea">replenishment at sea</a> (RAS) systems to allow the tankers to supply fuel over the stern using a long, buoyant hose. Under normal circumstances they could pump per hour, whereas an RFA tanker could refuel warships running alongside with transfer rates of per hour.

Other ships required major alterations. The conversion of "Atlantic Conveyor" at Devonport required the removal of 500 tie-down points for containers from her deck, adding a landing pad for helicopters and <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Harrier">Hawker Siddeley Harrier</a>s, installing UHF radio equipment and satellite communications, providing accommodation for 122 men, installing a <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> tank, cutting additional hatches, and modifying the stern doors. Similar conversions were undertaken on "Atlantic Causeway", "Contender Bezant" and "Astronomer". The experience with "Atlantic Conveyor" allowed these to be converted far more quickly. The conversion of "Uganda" to a hospital ship was carried out at Gibraltar in 65 hours. Minesweepers were converted at Rosyth. Some 17 ships were fitted with helicopter landing pads; on "Canberra" and "Queen Elizabeth 2", the area around the swimming pool was used, as it had been designed to hold the weight of of water. On and the cable ship "Iris" there was insufficient room for the flight deck and it had to be cantilevered over the stern. All ships fitted to operate helicopters also had to have communications, lighting and glide path indicators.
The Royal Marines normally kept war reserves both afloat and ashore, but the floating reserve was on "Sir Geraint", and had just been unloaded for a routine transfer to another LSL. These were soon reloaded. A request to the Army for assistance for the Commando Logistic Regiment in moving stores from the depots was met by 150 trucks on the first day; 1,500 trucks would ultimately be used. The depots despatched one million operational rations and twelve million ordinary meals. They also supplied of ammunition, of fuel, and of stores. Eventually, would be moved through to the ports. Good weather at Devonport and Portsmouth permitted loading to be carried out in the open without the danger of perishable stores being damaged by rain.

Ships were not <a href="combat%20loading">combat loaded</a>—loaded in such a way that the weapons, ammunition, equipment and stores that the embarked troops would require on landing were immediately accessible. Most units sent critical equipment to the ports first, and this then became the first equipment loaded, and the last that could be unloaded. "Baltic Ferry" had munitions stored deep in her holds that could only be retrieved by removing all the other cargo. Most of the 3rd Commando Brigade's ammunition, about of it, was loaded on "Elk", making that vessel a particularly vulnerable target.

Wheeled vehicles were not expected to be able to traverse the islands, so most were left behind. The 3rd Commando Brigade did take 54 of the Commando Logistic Regiment's 82 4-ton prime movers, ten of its fifteen fuel trucks, and nine of its forklifts. To make up for the wheeled vehicles, the 3rd Commando Brigade took 75 <a href="Bv202">Bv202</a> tracked vehicles. These were fetched from Scotland by <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>, the only use of rail during the initial deployment, because British Rail required seven days notice to reposition its rolling stock. Some 44 special trains were hired in the second week. All vehicles were loaded fully fuelled with two full <a href="jerry%20can">jerry can</a>s, a practice normally prohibited as a fire hazard. As it turned out, four-wheel drive vehicles were able to operate on the islands. The Commando Logistic Regiment was missing <a href="383%20Commando%20Petroleum%20Troop%20RLC">383 Commando Petroleum Troop</a>, as this was made up of reservists, who were not called up. Leaving personnel behind reduced the strength of the Commando Logistic Regiment from its normal peacetime strength of over 600 to just 346. The only supplement it received was three Surgical Support Teams. The 3rd Commando Brigade's air defences were bolstered by the addition of <a href="T%20Battery%20%28Shah%20Sujah%27s%20Troop%29%20Royal%20Artillery">T Battery (Shah Sujah's Troop) Royal Artillery</a>, armed with twelve <a href="Rapier%20%28missile%29">Rapier missile</a> launchers. The logistical implications of deploying and maintaining the battery in the field were not fully appreciated.

The task force headed for Ascension Island, a British territory in the mid-Atlantic from the UK and from the Falkland Islands. Parts of the island were leased by the US under a 1956 treaty which expired on 20 July 1975, but continued on an annual basis until either government announced its intention to terminate. Neither had done so by 1982. A 1962 exchange of notes obliged the US to provide "logistic, administrative or operating facilities at the airfield" for use by UK military aircraft. Ascension had about a thousand inhabitants, all contractors or employees, or the family members of contractors or employees, of British or American companies that included <a href="Cable%20%26amp%3B%20Wireless">Cable & Wireless</a>, the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC), <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan American World Airways</a> (Pan Am) and the US <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA). There were about 200 schoolchildren on the island, who were obliged to leave at age 18. Although considered a United States Air Force (USAF) base, the US military garrison consisted of just one man, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel William D. Bryden.

<a href="Wideawake%20Airfield">Wideawake Airfield</a> was built on the island by the US during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The runway was extended to in 1966 by the USAF to meet the demands of the <a href="Eastern%20Test%20Range">Eastern Test Range</a>, and the airfield operated on behalf of the US government by Pan Am. Although it had an excellent runway, there was only a small <a href="hardstand">hardstand</a> area for parking aircraft, and no parallel taxiways. In the year prior to April 1982, it handled an average of 24.4 aircraft arrivals per month. Ascension had an <a href="anchorage%20%28maritime%29">anchorage</a>, but no port facilities—just a lone <a href="jetty">jetty</a>. The island was resupplied on a regular basis by a charter flight, which brought fresh produce, and a freighter, . When the Falklands War broke out, "St Helena" was due and the charter flight had just departed. The island was therefore fortuitously well-stocked. There were two shops on the island, run by <a href="NAAFI">NAAFI</a> under contract. As such they looked like NAAFI stores, but charged much higher prices. At first these were open to service personnel, but as stocks quickly became low they were placed off limits to them. The <a href="Expeditionary%20Forces%20Institute">Expeditionary Forces Institute</a> (EFI) then established a third shop, exclusively for service personnel. After some delay, space was made available for a weekly supply run for the civilians. Their morale plummeted when it was announced that the Ministry of Defence had chartered "St Helena", their only means shipping baggage, receiving sea mail, and returning to <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a>, which had no airport. <a href="RFA%20Diligence%20%28A132%29">MV "Stena Inspector"</a> and had to be diverted from operational tasks to perform these duties. 
A dozen RAF <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a> transports flew to Ascension via Gibraltar and Dakar on 3 April, bringing stores and RAF and Royal Navy personnel to establish a base on Ascension. Royal Navy <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> Robert McQueen was appointed to command the British Forces Support Unit (BFSU) on Ascension, and arrived on 8 April. The BFSU ballooned to over 800 personnel in the first three weeks. It began operating <a href="Sikorsky%20SH-3%20Sea%20King">Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King</a> and <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Westland Wessex</a> helicopters.
Aviation fuel storage facilities on Ascension were controlled by the United States. On 13 April, the US agreed that the British forces could use of the stored on the island. Some of this allocation was consumed on 19 April, and just remained on 25 April when a supply tanker with commenced replenishment. At this point, the US released its reserve stocks for British use. Fuel was discharged from tankers through a floating pipeline to an American fuel farm. It then needed to be transported to Wideawake Airfield. Tanker trucks found the island's steep and rough road heavy going. The compacted volcanic rock used to surface the roads was abrasive, and tyres soon wore out. New sets had to be flown in. Sappers of 1 Troop, 51 Field Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>, built a pipeline to connect the fuel farm with the storage tanks at the airfield. Meanwhile, 12 Petroleum Operations Section, <a href="Royal%20Army%20Ordnance%20Corps">Royal Army Ordnance Corps</a>, had taken over management of the fuel farm. Fuel storage at Wideawake Airfield was increased by by the addition of <a href="fuel%20bladder">fuel bladder</a>s.

The RAF presence sharply increased after it was decided to use Ascension as a base for operations. Two <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Nimrod">Hawker Siddeley Nimrod</a> <a href="maritime%20patrol%20aircraft">maritime patrol aircraft</a> arrived on 5 April. These were followed by seventeen <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a> <a href="aerial%20refuelling%20tanker">aerial refuelling tanker</a>s and three <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> bombers, which conducted raids on the Falkland Islands as part of <a href="Operation%20Black%20Buck">Operation Black Buck</a>. The first five Victor tankers deployed to Ascension on 18 April, followed by four more the next day. Six more deployed by the end of the month, bringing the Victor tanker force to fourteen, since one had returned to their base at <a href="RAF%20Marham">RAF Marham</a> on 26 April. Each was refuelled by another Victor before leaving UK airspace. The station commander at Marham, <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> J. S. B. Price, became the senior RAF officer at Ascension. <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> D. W. Maurice-Jones assumed command of the Victor detachment until 22 April, when he was relieved by Wing Commander A. W. Bowman, the commander of <a href="No.%2057%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 57 Squadron RAF</a>. 

The number of personnel on the island increased to about one thousand, of whom around 120 were Navy, 60 were British Army, and 800 were RAF. This exceeded the capacity of the island's water supply, and McQueen instituted draconian measures to limit the number of personnel on Ascension Island, in some cases sending people back on the planes they arrived on. In early May, the USAF flew in fourteen planeloads of portable accommodation in the form of 31 twelve-man living units. Each was self-contained, with its own air-conditioning, bunks, showers and toilets. They were erected in five days by British and American personnel. The Army's <a href="30%20Signal%20Regiment">30 Signal Regiment</a> established direct telephone circuits to the UK, and its 2 Postal Regiment provided mail and courier services. By June, some 20,000 mailbags had passed through Ascension. A detachment of 9 Ordnance Battalion established laundry facilities in a disused laundry. Service cooks from all three services prepared a thousand meals per day through three field kitchens. Intelligence sources warned of a possible Argentine attack on Ascension, perhaps using special forces and a long-range civilian airliner like a <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>. Concerns about the vulnerability of the base led to three RAF Harriers being assigned for air defence on 10 May. These were replaced by <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II</a>s on 24 May.

"Hermes" reached Ascension on 16 April, and "Fearless", "Stromness" and the five LSLs the following day. "Canberra" and "Elk" arrived on 20 April, having refuelled at Freetown. By this time, cargo planes were arriving at Wideawake Airfield at a rate of eight per day, and of supplies had arrived, a third of which were earmarked for the 3rd Commando Brigade. Stores were difficult to identify, as many were poorly labelled, making it difficult to distinguish real ammunition from training ammunition. When cargo was not properly logged on arrival, it became difficult to know whether or not an item had been delivered. There was no security at the airfield, so goods were subject to <a href="pilferage">pilferage</a>. D Squadron, <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">22 Special Air Service Regiment</a>, helped themselves to special ammunition and weapons belonging to the 3rd Commando Brigade, which they thought were just lying around.
The amphibious force took the opportunity to re-stow its equipment. This took eleven days. Having not yet refuelled, "Fearless" rode too high in the water, and was unable to launch its LCUs, so the burden of the effort initially had to be carried by helicopters. Two Wessexes, three Sea Kings and a <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook">Boeing CH-47 Chinook</a> supported the effort. Shortages of lifting gear and <a href="cargo%20net">cargo net</a>s hampered the effort, as did the haphazard original stowage of stores. In some cases, cargo had shifted during the voyage to Ascension. Some 138 Wessex, 40 Chinook and 40 Sea King sorties were flown on a single day. The LSLs "Sir Galahad" and "Sir Percivale" were stocked with two days' supply of ammunition, fuel and rations. Four more days' supply was stowed on "Stromness", and sixteen on "Elk". Units were issued with supplies and equipment they would require for an amphibious assault. Meanwhile, "Intrepid", "Atlantic Conveyor", "Norland" and "Europic Ferry" departed the UK on 25 and 26 April, and "Sir Bedivere", which reached Marchwood on 25 April, sailed for Ascension on 27 April. The five LSLs, carrying most of the Commando Logistic Regiment, weighed anchor and set out for the Falkland Islands on 1 May, along with "Pearleaf" and escorted by the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> . "Norland" arrived at Ascension on the morning of 7 May, and departed for the Falklands that evening. "Canberra", "Tidepool" and "Elk" had left the previous day, and the last ship, the LPD "Intrepid", departed Ascension on 8 May.

To allow ships to be resupplied by air when operating in the South Atlantic, modifications were made to the Hercules aircraft, which normally had a range of about . At <a href="RAF%20Lyneham">RAF Lyneham</a>, Hercules transports were fitted with pairs of auxiliary fuel tanks, thereby extending their range by three or four hours. Adding four tanks increased the range further still, but reduced the cargo carrying capacity by 75 per cent. These modified Hercules aircraft became known as LR2 and LR4 variants, depending on how many auxiliary tanks had been installed. They were also modified to allow for <a href="aerial%20refuelling">aerial refuelling</a> by the addition of refuelling probes taken from Vulcan bombers. In the search for refuelling probes, they were taken from Vulcans at the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Museum%20London">Royal Air Force Museum London</a>, <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum%20Duxford">Imperial War Museum Duxford</a>, <a href="Castle%20Air%20Museum">Castle Air Museum</a> in <a href="California">California</a>, and the <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command%20%26amp%3B%20Aerospace%20Museum">Strategic Air Command & Aerospace Museum</a> in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. The Hercules transports were the first propeller-driven aircraft to be refuelled by Victor tankers. The difference in the speeds required skilful flying. A Victor would approach a Hercules from above and aft at . The Hercules would then descend at per minute. At full throttle, this allowed the Hercules to reach , the minimum speed of the Victor. Refuelling took about 15 minutes, by which time they would have descended to , but occasionally it took longer and they descended as low as .

Part of 47 Air Despatch Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Transport">Royal Corps of Transport</a>, went to Ascension on "Fearless". They prepared their first packages for <a href="airdrop">airdrop</a>ping on 19 April, of high priority supplies for and "Invincible". The first LR2 Hercules arrived at Wideawake Airfield on 12 May, and four days later a 24-hour, flight delivered of supplies to "Antelope". A flight to the Falkland Islands would take 28 hours, so two crews were needed, and required five Victor tankers for aerial refuelling. McQueen tried to enforce a policy that airdrop loads be rigged in the UK to save space at Ascension, but was overruled by Fieldhouse. By 1 June, 47 Air Despatch Squadron had prepared 47 loads totalling , with high priority items delivered within 40 hours of the initial request. Airdrop missions mounted from Ascension were given girls' names, in ascending alphabetical order. After "Zara" was flown on 9 June, the sequence started again with "Alison" the following day. While most airdrops were at sea, some were made to units in the Falkland Islands. Those at sea were made with the stores in waterproof containers which were retrieved by the ships' boats. Occasionally personnel were also dropped. In the "Ursula" mission on 1 June, Lieutenant Colonel David Chaundler, a replacement commander for 2 Para, parachuted into the sea and was plucked from the water by a boat from the frigate .

The plan for an amphibious landing in the Falkland Islands, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Sutton">Operation Sutton</a>, called for units to land from the ships in which they had sailed, which meant that 40 Commando, 42 Commando and 3 Para would land from "Canberra"; but Fieldhouse became nervous about risking 2,000 men on one ship. On 18 May, Clapp received orders for different battalions to be carried on separate ships. Unusually calm seas on 19 May allowed this cross-decking to be carried out by LCUs and LCVPs from "Fearless" and "Intrepid", with 40 Commando transferred to the former, and 3 Para to the latter. Both LPDs were seriously overloaded, and, unlike "Canberra", did not have enough life rafts for everyone. After sunset an <a href="846%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">846 Naval Air Squadron</a> Sea King from "Hermes" transferring troops of D Squadron, 22 Special Air Service Regiment, to "Intrepid" crashed into the ocean. "Intrepid"s LCVPs rescued eight men, but 22 others were lost.

Another change was that the Commando Logistic Regiment wanted the LSLs beached so they could be quickly unloaded. Clapp demurred. If done improperly, this could damage the ship. For this reason, peacetime financial restraints had prevented the LSL captains from practising this manoeuvre. Clapp ruled that the LSLs would discharge onto mexeflotes and landing craft through the stern doors. The LSLs had been loaded with the most urgently required stores in the bow, where they could be accessed first, but now the order needed to be changed. The double-handling required meant that unloading would be slower than planned.

The logistics plan called for the support elements of the combat units, known as the B Echelons, to remain afloat, along with the entire Commando Logistic Regiment. After the beachhead was secured, the B Echelons would join their units. Lieutenant Colonel Ivar Hellberg, the commander of the Commando Logistic Regiment, and Major Gerry Wells-Cole, the 3rd Commando Brigade's Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DAA & QMG), would select a Brigade Maintenance Area (BMA) site near Ajax Bay to be run by the Commando Logistic Regiment. Engineers would establish a refuelling point for Harriers and helicopters, and establish water points.

Hellberg and Wells-Cole planned to use a "pull" system whereby unit quartermasters would request supplies that they needed. There would be no equipment repair facilities ashore; the Commando Logistic Regiment's Workshop Squadron would remain afloat, with detachments going ashore temporarily to retrieve or repair equipment as necessary. Medical support was supplied by No. 1 Medical Troop on "Sir Galahad", the Parachute Clearing Troop of the <a href="16th%20%28Parachute%29%20Field%20Ambulance">16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance</a> on "Norland", and No. 3 Medical Troop, No. 2 Surgical Support Team and the Commando Logistic Regiment's Medical Squadron on "Canberra". After the beachhead was secure, No. 1 Medical Troop and the Parachute Clearing Troop would establish a field dressing station in the BMA. Casualties could be flown to "Uganda", and then taken to Montevideo by , "Hydra" and "Hecla", from whence they would be flown back to the UK via Ascension. The dead would be buried in the BMA or at sea.
The amphibious force entered <a href="Falkland%20Sound">Falkland Sound</a> shortly after midnight local time on 21 May, delayed by mists and navigational difficulties. One of "Fearless"s ballast pumps broke down, slowing the start of dock operations. Four LCUs from "Intrepid" collected 2 Para from "Norland", while 40 Commando boarded four LCVPs and four LCUs; the LCVPs were needed because two of its LCUs were carrying a <a href="FV101%20Scorpion">FV101 Scorpion</a> and a <a href="FV107%20Scimitar">FV107 Scimitar</a>. 2 Para was slow boarding the LCUs, as this had not been practised, and one man suffered a crushed pelvis when he fell between the ship and an LCU. The various mishaps caused <a href="H-hour">H-hour</a> to be postponed by an hour. Guided by Major <a href="Ewen%20Southby-Tailyour">Ewen Southby-Tailyour</a>, they landed at <a href="San%20Carlos%20Water">San Carlos Water</a>, (Blue Beach) at 03:30. They then secured the high ground of the <a href="Sussex%20Mountains">Sussex Mountains</a>, establishing a <a href="reverse%20slope%20defence">reverse slope defence</a>. Meanwhile the landing craft returned to take 45 Commando from "Intrepid" and "Stromness" to <a href="Ajax%20Bay">Ajax Bay</a> (Red Beach), and 3 Para from "Intrepid" to <a href="Port%20San%20Carlos">Port San Carlos</a> (Green Beach). 42 Commando remained on "Canberra" as a reserve. Delays in landing the first wave meant that the second was about two hours late, with 3 Para landing at 07:30.

Daylight allowed helicopter operations to begin. On 21 May, helicopters carried 288 loads, moving 520 personnel and of stores from 11 ships to 21 sites. STUFT were unloaded at a rate of per hour, and the LSLs could be unloaded at per hour, the lesson being that STUFT were a poor substitute for purpose-built amphibious vessels. Priority was given to moving the six <a href="L118%20light%20gun">L118 light gun</a>s of 79 Commando Battery, <a href="29th%20Commando%20Regiment%20Royal%20Artillery">29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery</a>, ashore. Moving a battery with 500 rounds per gun required 85 Sea King sorties. The next priority was to position the Rapiers of T battery, but owing to the delays in the landing, the Rapier sites were not secured until around midday. Generally located on hilltops where there were no roads or tracks, the Rapiers had to be sited by helicopter. If they had to be moved, whether yards or miles, another helicopter sortie was called for. No one knew for certain what the effect of seven weeks' sea voyage would be on the equipment, but the need for air defence was obvious, as the Argentine air forces made <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Carlos%20%281982%29">repeated attacks on ships</a> in Falkland Sound. Two Gazelle helicopters were lost.
Of the seven escorts, five, , , , and , were hit; only and were unscathed. Of those hit, only "Broadsword" was fully capable of continuing the fight, while "Ardent" was ablaze and sinking. Clapp decided that the sound was too dangerous for STUFT, and ordered that "Canberra", "Norland" and "Europic Ferry" leave Falkland Sound by midnight. The LSLs remained, but on 23 May Argentine bombs found "Sir Bedivere", "Sir Galahad" and "Sir Lancelot". None of those that struck the LSLs exploded. Damage to "Sir Bedivere" was minor, but "Sir Galahad" was set on fire and beached, and was put out of action for a week. Fires started on "Sir Lancelot", which put it out of action until 7 June—although in the meantime she acted as an accommodation ship and helicopter refuelling station. Clapp decided that the remaining stores had to be landed as quickly as possible. Inevitably, some stores that were neither requested nor required were landed.

This disrupted the logistics plan. 42 Commando came ashore at Green Beach by LCU, but the B Echelons remained on "Canberra", and the assault troops had left rucksacks, parkas, sleeping and cooking gear, and spare clothing behind. "Canberra" and "Norland" also took 90,000 rations with them. The BMA was far from ideal. There was a landing ramp where forklifts could unload landing craft, but unusable rocky ground limited the area available to about a third of what was really required to properly disperse the stores, and the only cover was a disused refrigeration plant on the shore of Ajax Bay, which had been taken over by the hospital.

Commander <a href="Rick%20Jolly">Rick Jolly</a> brought No. 2 Surgical Support Team and the Headquarters of the Commando Logistic Regiment's Medical Squadron ashore from "Canberra". No. 1 Medical Troop disembarked from "Sir Galahad", and the Parachute Clearing Troop had already come ashore from "Norland". With these units he set up a field hospital in the refrigeration plant. They decided not to paint a Red Cross on the building, as it was close to the ordnance stores, and Argentina was not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. A sign painted over the entrance proclaimed it to be "The Red and Green Life Machine", alluding to the colour of the paratroopers' and commandos' berets. A "Water Heater, Field Kitchen, Portable" was the sole source of hot water for the surgical team at Ajax Bay. It was loaned from an American unit for a crate of beer, the British kit they were supposed to use never made it ashore. Of 1,205 men treated, including 310 who required major surgery, 3 died.
"Atlantic Conveyor" was struck by an <a href="Exocet">Exocet</a> <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a> on the afternoon of 25 May and set ablaze. Although she remained afloat for several days, nothing could be salvaged. She was the most serious loss of the campaign. Twelve of those on board died, but 150 were rescued. Of the aircraft she had brought to the South Atlantic, the Harriers of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 1 Squadron RAF</a> had already been transferred to "Hermes", a Wessex of <a href="848%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">848 Naval Air Squadron</a> had already flown ashore, and a Chinook of <a href="No.%2018%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 18 Squadron RAF</a> was in the air at the time. The rest, three Chinook and six Wessex helicopters, were lost.

The <a href="Bravo%20November">lone surviving Chinook</a> landed on "Hermes". It spent the night there, arrived at San Carlos the next day, and was made available for missions on 29 May. The Chinook arrived with two aircrews, and a maintenance detachment, but they had no tools, spare parts or documentation, all of which were lost with "Atlantic Conveyor". Somehow, it went on to fly 109 hours without servicing, carrying 1,500 troops, 95 casualties, 650 Argentine <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> (POWs) and of cargo. At one point it carried 81 paratroops in a single load, and then returned to fetch another 75, and it survived being accidentally flown into the sea one night during a snowstorm.

In addition to the helicopters, "Atlantic Conveyor" took with her four tent camps, complete with field kitchens and sanitary facilities, which would have accommodated 4,500 personnel. Another serious loss was a portable fuelling system and six fuel tanks. Material for building an airstrip at Port San Carlos also went down, but <a href="59%20Independent%20Commando%20Squadron%20Royal%20Engineers">59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers</a> managed to build it anyway, using matting earmarked for repairing <a href="Port%20Stanley%20Airport">Port Stanley Airport</a>. All ships were unloaded by 27 May, leaving only the two damaged LSLs at San Carlos.

North east of the Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) that the British government had declared around the Falkland Islands, the Royal Navy designated a Tug, Repair and Logistics Area (TRALA) where ships could receive and transfer supplies, and conduct repairs of battle damage under the protection of the carrier battle group. Hercules airdrops were made to ships there. Ships were now held in the TRALA, from whence it took about 20 hours to reach San Carlos. Their captains preferred to navigate Falkland Sound by night, allowing them to be unloaded by day, which suited the Commando Logistic Regiment. Working around the clock was inadvisable, for there were no relief crews for the landing craft or helicopters. Only four Sea Kings had night vision equipment, allowing them to operate at night. These were reserved for night operations. To allow the crews to rest, and necessary aircraft maintenance to be performed, they were not employed during the day. One Sea King was permanently assigned to support of the Rapier battery. This left six Sea Kings, five Wessexes and the Chinook available for logistical and tactical missions. Requested supplies took at least two days to fetch from the TRALA. Hellberg visited Clapp on "Fearless" each night and presented a list of required ships. Clapp would then signal Woodward and ask for them; but for operational reasons a requested ship might not arrive, or a substitute might be sent containing none of the required stores. The Ordnance Squadron of the Commando Logistic Regiment had compiled lists of what was on board each ship, but lacked the manpower to maintain teams on all the supply ships. Goods became damaged from improper storage or handling, or were pilfered, and the contents of the ships slowly became less certain. carried stores for both the Royal Navy and the 3rd Commando Brigade, and with no one to assess conflicting priorities, she remained with the fleet.

"Stromness" brought the Emergency Fuel Handling Equipment (EFHE) on 23 May. This had been loaded on multiple ships, and not all the components could be located; but the 59 Independent Commando Squadron was still able to rig it. A <a href="Dracone%20Barge">Dracone Barge</a> was moored offshore, and piping attached that allowed aviation fuel to be pumped into collapsible tanks ashore. This allowed helicopters to refuel ashore, eliminating the need to land on the LPDs, which had two helipads, or the LSLs, which had one each, for refuelling, for which they competed with the 21 light helicopters of <a href="3%20Commando%20Brigade%20Air%20Squadron">3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron</a>.

On 24 May, 11 Field Squadron commenced work on an airstrip to allow Harriers to refuel as well. The plant and equipment earmarked for this was lost on "Atlantic Conveyor", but "Stromness" had aluminium panels for airfield surfacing, which were landed at Green Beach by helicopter and landing craft, and taken to the site with civilian vehicles. The airstrip was completed, with a ski jump for Harriers, using more than eighty of the panels, assembled by hand, on 2 June. The absence of 383 Commando Petroleum Troop, though, meant that there was no one to operate the fuel points until the 5th Infantry Brigade arrived. Its attached 91 Ordnance Company had a petroleum platoon, the only regular army one based in the UK. These specialists took over the EFHE at Port San Carlos as soon as they arrived on 3 June, allowing Harriers to be refuelled there from 5 June. It was damaged by a Harrier that crash landed on 8 June, but was repaired. Over 150 operational sorties were flown from the airstrip between 5 and 14 June. 
Argentine air attacks were initially directed at the ships, but on 27 May four <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">Douglas A-4 Skyhawk</a>s attacked the BMA, dropping twelve bombs, only four of which exploded. Six men were killed and thirty wounded. The field hospital was struck by two bombs, neither of which exploded. They would remain in place, sandbagged and defuzed, for the rest of the campaign. Bombs that struck the ordnance area set off stockpiles of 105 mm artillery shells, <a href="MILAN">MILAN</a> missiles and <a href="L16%2081mm%20mortar">81 mm mortar</a> bombs. The Commando Logistic Regiment had no fire fighting equipment, so the fire was left to burn itself out, and explosions continued through the night. All of 45 Commando's MILAN missiles were lost, along with two-hundred mortar bombs and three-hundred artillery rounds.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Goose%20Green">Battle of Goose Green</a> on 28 and 29 May confirmed what logisticians had suspected and feared; the expenditure of ammunition was not only five times greater than that expected in a limited war, it exceeded that forecast for an all-out war against the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>. Another 30 days' supply had been ordered on 17 April, and was on its way south, but by the evening of 28 May, the BMA held just eighty-three artillery rounds, thirty MILAN missiles, two days' supply of ten-man ration packs and three days' of medical stores, and no one-man ration packs, cooking fuel or spare clothing. The ration situation was exacerbated when 2 Para captured nearly a thousand Argentine prisoners at <a href="Goose%20Green">Goose Green</a>, all of whom had to be fed. Since the tents were lost on "Atlantic Conveyor", they had to be kept in the disused refrigeration plant during the night. The Argentine wounded put more pressure on the medical supplies, and the Argentine dead had to be disposed of, although the task force had no graves unit. The Commando Logistic Regiment buried them in a mass grave near <a href="Darwin%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Darwin</a>.

After the war, Thompson reflected that:
At first light on 27 May, 45 Commando embarked in LCUs that took it from Ajax Bay to Port San Carlos. It then conducted a <a href="loaded%20march">loaded march</a> (which the commandos called a "<a href="yomp">yomp</a>" and the paras called a "tab") to <a href="Douglas%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Douglas</a>. Every man carried about ; some carried far more. Douglas was reached at 13:00 on 28 May. 3 Para set out from Port San Carlos at 11:00 on 27 May, and reached the Arroy Pedro River, from <a href="Teal%20Inlet">Teal Inlet</a>, at 11:00 on 28 May. The paras waited until night-fall before advancing on Teal Inlet, which was secured by 23:00. They were joined on the morning of 29 May by the Scorpion and Scimitar light tanks of No. 4 Troop, <a href="Blues%20and%20Royals">Blues and Royals</a>, whose departure from Port San Carlos had been delayed by a temporary fuel shortage which had occurred when "Sir Lancelot" jettisoned all its motor transport fuel on discovering an unexploded bomb on board. Once fuel was secured, they were able to make the journey to Teal Inlet, arriving on the morning of 29 May. 3 Para and 45 Commando were then ordered to advance to Estancia.

Helicopters resupplied 3 Para, and brought its mortars and support weapons. Estancia House was taken on 31 May, with 3 Para utilising local farm tractors to move its stores and heavy equipment. An attempt to fly 42 Commando and three guns to <a href="Mount%20Kent">Mount Kent</a> on 29/30 May ran into a blizzard and was forced to return to Port San Carlos. A second attempt the following night succeeded. With the high ground overlooking Teal Inlet in British hands, a Forward Brigade Maintenance Area (FBMA) was established there, with a Distribution Point (DP) at Estancia. Supplies were delivered to the FBMA by LSL, and then moved to the DP by Bv202, requisitioned local farm tractor or helicopter. A Forward Arming and Refuelling Point (FARP) at Teal Inlet saved the helicopters from having to make a round trip for replenishment.

Brigadier <a href="Tony%20Wilson%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Tony Wilson</a>'s 5th Infantry Brigade reached <a href="Cumberland%20Bay">Cumberland Bay</a> off South Georgia Island on "Queen Elizabeth 2" on 27 May. The politicians were nervous about the political repercussions if the ship were lost, so it was decided to unload it here, and move the brigade to the Falkland Islands in other ships. The "Queen Elizabeth 2" was met by a veritable fleet of ships that proceeded to unload her passengers and cargo. The trawler cum minesweepers , , , and ferried the infantry and the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance across to "Canberra" and "Norland", which departed for San Carlos at 21:00 on 28 May. Cargo was unloaded onto "Stromness", "Resource", "Saxonia", "Lycaon", , "British Esk" and "British Tay".

A false warning of an attack by Argentine forces caused "Queen Elizabeth 2" to weigh anchor and set sail for the UK on 29 May. So difficult was it to unload the ship that around 70 per cent of the brigade's mortar and artillery rounds remained on board. "Stromness" headed for San Carlos with most of the logistics units. Inclement weather made what would normally be a two-day voyage into a four-day one. Moore established his headquarters on "Fearless" on 29 May, and assumed control of land battle the following day. "Atlantic Causeway", with twenty Wessex and eight Sea King helicopters, arrived at San Carlos on 1 June, and "Canberra" and "Norland" followed the next day.

The logistics units that arrived with the 5th Infantry Brigade included 81 Ordnance Company, which supplied most services, and 91 Ordnance Company, a third line unit that included a laundry section, bath unit and field bakery, and most importantly, the petroleum platoon. 10 Field Workshop provided maintenance support, but most of its equipment was on "Baltic Ferry" and "Nordic Ferry", which departed without unloading due to another air raid alert. The unit therefore spent much of its time guarding POWs. 407 Transport Troop brought 20 <a href="Snowcat">Snowcat</a>s, predecessors of the Bv202s, but only six were landed in the first few days. There was also <a href="160%20Provost%20Company">160 Provost Company</a>, <a href="Royal%20Military%20Police">Royal Military Police</a> and 6 Field Cash Office, <a href="Royal%20Army%20Pay%20Corps">Royal Army Pay Corps</a>. These logistic units constituted an augmentation of the Commando Logistic Regiment, rather than the logistic support required by a brigade engaged in combat operations.

As a result, the 5th Infantry Brigade's arrival in the Falklands meant that the Commando Logistic Regiment became responsible for supporting two large brigades with a total strength of around 9,000 personnel. This placed stress on the regiment, as it was structured to support only the 3rd Commando Brigade's 3,000 personnel, and it had deployed to the Falklands with less than its usual allocations of manpower and transport. The coastal vessel MV "Monsunen" had been used by the Argentinians until forced aground near Goose Green by "Yarmouth" on 23 May. It was salvaged by a <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a> from "Fearless", and used to supplement the 5th Infantry Brigade's transport. 
While the 3rd Commando Brigade advanced on <a href="Port%20Stanley">Port Stanley</a> on a northerly axis, the 5th Infantry Brigade advanced on a southerly one. The plan was to establish a second FBMA at <a href="Fitzroy%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Fitzroy</a> with a DP at <a href="Bluff%20Cove">Bluff Cove</a>. It was nowhere near as good as Teal Inlet. The route from Port San Carlos went all the way around <a href="Lafonia">Lafonia</a>, a distance that landing craft and mexeflotes could not cover on their own. While the LPDs were fast enough to get there and back in darkness, the LSLs could not. Moreover, unlike at Teal Inlet, the Argentinians held the high ground overlooking it. As a result, "Sir Galahad" and "Sir Tristram" were caught unloading in daylight on 8 June and <a href="Bluff%20Cove%20Air%20Attacks">attacked by Argentine aircraft</a>.

Both were set ablaze. The fires on "Sir Tristram" soon burned themselves out, some of the cargo was saved, and the ship was ultimately salvaged, but "Sir Galahad" was a total loss. The disaster cost 49 men their lives; another 115 were wounded. Among the dead were four Chinese crewmen. The field hospital was flooded with casualties, and arrangements were made for landing craft to send two dozen each to "Fearless", "Intrepid" and "Atlantic Causeway". Others were flown to "Uganda". That same day one of the LCUs from "Fearless" was caught in open water in daylight, and attacked and sunk by Argentine aircraft. Six men were killed. On board were six <a href="land%20rover">land rover</a>s carrying the 5th Brigade's communications equipment. 

For the final battles around Port Stanley, the gun positions were stocked with 500 rounds per gun, with another 500 in reserve. Each combat unit would have two days' supply, with another two days' at the FBMAs at Fitzroy or Teal Inlet. The remaining LSLs made runs to Fitzroy and Teal Inlet on alternating days, moving over to each. The arrival of four more Wessex helicopters on "Engadine" brought the number of helicopters available to forty. These were used to move the ammunition to the gun positions. FARPs at each FBMA saved the helicopters from having to return to San Carlos. The field hospital was broken up on 10 June, with teams deploying to Fitzroy and Teal Inlet.

The final four-day battle around Port Stanley involved some of the hardest fighting of the campaign. One battery almost ran out of ammunition, requiring an emergency helicopter resupply mission in a snowstorm at night. The lone bridge over the <a href="Murrell%20River">Murrell River</a> collapsed when an armoured recovery vehicle loaded with ammunition attempted to cross it, cutting the 3rd Commando Brigade's overland supply line for their Bv202s, but the engineers built an air-portable bridge at Fitzroy which the Chinook delivered.

On 14 June, the Argentine commander, Brigadier General <a href="Mario%20Men%C3%A9ndez">Mario Menéndez</a> surrendered Argentine forces in the Falkland Islands to Moore.

Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Kennedy arrived at San Carlos soon after the Argentine surrender as Commander Royal Engineers (CRE) Works, Falkland Islands. His task was to rehabilitate Port Stanley. It took the sappers of 9 Parachute Squadron and 61 Field Squadron four days to restore the water supply to Port Stanley. By this time, the reservoirs were down to two days' supply. In the meantime it was supplied by "Fort Toronto" through a dracone moored offshore. A military water supply point at <a href="Moody%20Brook">Moody Brook</a> was constructed and operated by 3 Field Squadron. The town's consumption was about per day. The electric grid had also been damaged by shellfire, and took a week longer to repair. Its capacity was still limited, so it was supplemented by two 250 KW Army generators. A separate military power station was subsequently established. Fuel was supplied using a dracone.
The major task was restoration of the port and airfield. In the interim, the Hercules transports continued to fly from Ascension, dropping high priority items. The postal unit moved from Ajax Bay into the Post Office at Port Stanley. At first, mail bags were airdropped but some fell into Argentine minefields. A method was then devised to allow the Hercules to deliver bags without having to land by trailing a grappling hook attached to the bags which snagged a wire strung between two poles.

Built in the 1970s, the airfield had a runway. It was unusable because it had been cratered by the RAF. Its rehabilitation was undertaken by 11 Field Squadron and 59 Independent Commando Squadron. The Argentinians had already repaired three craters. The others were filled in and topped with Argentine aluminium matting. A huge crater caused by a bomb required over of matting. "Scabs", or scrapes in the runway surface, of which there were several hundred, were repaired with <a href="Bostik">Bostik</a> 276, a magnesium phosphate cement and aggregate mixture. There were 47 Hercules and several hundred Harrier landings before the airfield was closed for repairs on 15 August. 

The runway was too short for use by the RAF's Phantoms, so 50 Field Squadron (which had been detailed for the task in May) began extending it to . Some of airfield construction stores, plant and equipment were landed for this purpose. Aluminium matting was laid along the whole length of the runway. Some of quartz granite rock fill was used, which was obtained by 3 and 60 Field Squadrons from a local quarry. The first Hercules landed on the new runway on 28 August. <a href="RAF%20Mount%20Pleasant">RAF Mount Pleasant</a>, a permanent RAF airbase, was subsequently built, and was opened by <a href="Prince%20Andrew">Prince Andrew</a> on 12 May 1985. 

Sites for the breakdown and storage of bulk supplies were limited, and the warehouses were initially used for the Argentine prisoners. While Port Stanley provided anchorages for deep draft vessels, berths were only deep, suitable only for shallow draft vessels. The Royal Engineers built two <a href="slipway">slipway</a>s for mexeflotes and LCUs. As late as April 1983, the Ministry of Defence had 25 ships on charter to supply the Falkland Islands. About 1,000 personnel were being ferried to and from the islands each month, requiring the services of "Uganda" and "<a href="Cunard%20Countess">Cunard Countess</a>". To provide a regular service, a ferry, the SS "St Edmund" was taken up and commissioned as a troopship, HMS "Keren". The port was replaced by a £23 million floating wharf and warehouse complex that opened on 26 April 1984. This consisted of six North Sea oil rig support barges that were linked together. Atop them were warehouses, refrigerated storages, and accommodation and mess facilities for 200 people. It could berth vessels up to long, and was connected to the shore by a two-lane causeway. An access road was constructed by 37 Engineer Regiment. 
With the end of hostilities in the Falklands (although <a href="Operation%20Keyhole">Operation Keyhole</a>, the reoccupation of <a href="Thule%20Island">Thule Island</a> in the <a href="South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Sandwich Islands</a>, remained, and was concluded on 20 June), the British forces became responsible for feeding the civilian population and 11,848 Argentine prisoners. Due to the British blockade of the island, they had only three days' rations. The prisoners were initially issued with Argentine rations, but the British withheld the officer rations as they contained alcohol. Prisoners rioted on 16 June, setting fire to their clothing store. Those taken at Goose Green had already been repatriated to Argentina via <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> in neutral Uruguay on "Norland". Some 5,000 Argentine prisoners were embarked on "Canberra" and 1,000 on "Norland" on 17 June. By 20 June 10,250 prisoners had been repatriated. Only 593 remained, including Menéndez. These were held for intelligence gathering, and to encourage Argentina to end hostilities. One British prisoner, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> <a href="Jeffrey%20Glover">Jeffrey Glover</a>, was held in Argentina; he was released on 16 July. The last Argentine prisoners were repatriated by 14 July.

The Bakery Section of 91 Ordnance Company baked its first loaf in the Falkland Islands on 30 June. It baked up to 6,000 loaves per day before settling down to just 4,000 by August. Although rations could soon be supplemented with fresh fruit and vegetables, it was not until August that the troops could be fed fresh rations. A wing of the small <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20Memorial%20Hospital">King Edward VII Memorial Hospital</a> at Port Stanley was occupied by 16 Field Ambulance. Its first task was sorting through captured Argentine medical supplies. The military hospital wing opened on 29 June. "Uganda" dropped anchor at <a href="Port%20William%2C%20Falkland%20Islands">Port William</a> to supply backup care, and donated fifty hospital beds and bedding to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. Having sailed from the UK on the <a href="TEV%20Rangatira%20%281971%29">TEV "Rangatira"</a> on 19 June, 2 Field Hospital reached the Falkland Islands on 11 July. Its staff included fourteen officers and other ranks of <a href="Queen%20Alexandra%27s%20Royal%20Army%20Nursing%20Corps">Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps</a>. Its tent accommodation had been lost on "Atlantic Conveyor", so it moved into the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. About of British ammunition was recovered from 47 battlefield sites by 81 Ordnance Company, along with over 4.5 million rounds of Argentine ammunition. Some was found to be serviceable, and was shipped to the UK. Most Argentine equipment was dumped at sea, but some items, including Chinook and <a href="AgustaWestland%20AW109">Agusta 109</a> helicopters, were taken back to the UK.
The first units to return from the Falkland Islands were 2 and 3 Para, which left on "Norland" and "Europic" in June. The 3rd Commando Brigade followed, departing on "Canberra" on 26 June, with the Commando Logistic Regiment embarking on "Sir Percivale" two days later. This left the 5th Infantry Brigade, whose logistic support was consolidated into the Falkland Islands Logistic Battalion on 28 June. Major General <a href="David%20Thorne%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">David Thorne</a> became Commander, <a href="British%20Forces%20Falkland%20Islands">British Forces Falkland Islands</a> in July. He brought the 1st Battalion <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Highlanders%20%28Seaforth%20and%20Camerons%29">Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons)</a> and a company of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Lancashire%20Regiment">Queen's Lancashire Regiment</a> with him, enabling the relief of the 5th Infantry Brigade's combat units to commence. The last of these, the 2nd Battalion, <a href="Scots%20Guards">Scots Guards</a>, departed the Falkland Islands in July.

Thorne gave a high priority to providing proper accommodation for his men before the next winter. <a href="Portable%20building">Portable building</a>s were erected with running water, electric power and sewerage. Additional accommodation was provided by the "coastels", floating multi-storeyed accommodation vessels for 900 people with their own kitchens, fresh water, laundry and recreational facilities. "Safe Dominia" and "Safe Esperia" were chartered from the Swedish Consafe. The latter's facilities included a gymnasium, four squash courts, two swimming pools and a canteen, which was operated by <a href="NAAFI">NAAFI</a>. They were joined by the British-built "Pursuivant", which left for the Falkland Islands in July 1983. Thorne was succeeded by Major General <a href="Peter%20de%20la%20Billi%C3%A8re">Peter de la Billière</a> in 1984.
A Grave Registration unit of the <a href="Royal%20Pioneer%20Corps">Royal Pioneer Corps</a> arrived on the SS "Strathewe", along with coffins and embalming materials. It had the task of disinterring the bodies of those killed. For the first time in British history, families were given the option of having their loved ones' remains returned to the UK, and 64 chose to exercise this option. The remaining 14 bodies (including that of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="H.%20Jones">H. Jones</a>, who was posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC) for his part in the Battle of Goose Green) were re-interred in the <a href="Blue%20Beach%20Military%20Cemetery%20at%20San%20Carlos">Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos</a>. An <a href="Argentine%20Military%20Cemetery">Argentine Military Cemetery</a> was established near Goose Green in 1983, which was rebuilt between 2002 and 2004. The Argentine government did not wish to "repatriate" its dead, as it considered that they were already in Argentina. Many were not identified, and were buried with the inscription "Argentine soldier known unto God."

In the logistics section of its report to Parliament on the lessons of the war, the Ministry of Defence highlighted the prodigious expenditure of ammunition and missiles; the high level of logistic support required for operations outside western Europe; the importance of civil resources in the defence effort; and the utility of aerial refuelling. The value of the Royal Navy's amphibious forces was reassessed. A replacement for the lost "Sir Galahad" was ordered, and two roll-on roll-off ferries, and , were chartered while the new was built and "Sir Tristram" was repaired. However, the government still dithered over the replacement of the "Fearless"-class LPDs; and replacements, the , were not ordered until 1996. The oil rig support ship MV "Stena Inspector" was purchased in 1983, and became , while "Astronomer" and "Contender Bezant" were retained as RFA "Reliant" and "Argus" respectively. The value of STUFT was recognised, and over the next few years STUFT would see active service in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.

The Falkland War was also studied in other countries, notably in China, where it was the subject of organised teaching and research at the PLA Naval Command College in <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. The Americans were impressed by the speed with which the British were able to mobilise their forces and get them moving to the theatre of operations in response to a crisis that had erupted with very little warning. A programme was already under way to improve American sealift capability, and between 1982 and 1986, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> appropriated and spent US $7 billion on the purchase or lease of new logistics ships. They would be tested in the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. Thompson felt that the overriding importance of logistics as the driving factor of operations was overlooked. He was particularly disappointed that the 5th Infantry Brigade had not used the time it had before embarkation to remedy more of its logistical shortcomings.

Logistics lessons drawn from the conflict were not new, but had not been learned either. These included the failure to integrate operational and tactical planning; improper tactical loading of ships; outdated planning data for consumables, particularly fuel and ammunition; lack of heavy-lift helicopters and poor discipline in the employment of helicopters; shortages of land transport; the employment of new and highly complex equipment on the battlefield; faulty casualty evacuation plans; and the need for post-conflict planning. British and American commentators observed that much of this could be traced to logistically unrealistic peacetime training and exercises, and called for more exercises where there were "no permanent quarters to house the troops, no Federal Express to deliver critical supply parts, no power production and no in-place hookups for communications or intelligence information."

2007 ACC Championship Game

The 2007 Dr. Pepper <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> featured the <a href="2007%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College Eagles</a> and the <a href="2007%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> in a regular-season <a href="college%20football">college football</a> game that determined the conference's champion for the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 season</a>. Virginia Tech defeated Boston College 30–16 to win the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">ACC</a> football championship. The game, held at <a href="Jacksonville%20Municipal%20Stadium">Jacksonville Municipal Stadium</a> in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, was a rematch of a regular-season game that took place on October 25, in <a href="Blacksburg%2C%20Virginia">Blacksburg, Virginia</a>. In that game, Boston College, courtesy of a late-game comeback by <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a>, won 14–10.

Following the loss, Virginia Tech won five straight games to win the Coastal Division of the ACC, while Boston College stumbled, losing two games before defeating the Clemson Tigers to win the Atlantic Division and representation in the Championship Game. Most pre-game media coverage of the event cast the game as an opportunity for Virginia Tech to avenge its earlier loss. In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid to the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> <a href="2008%20Orange%20Bowl">2008 Orange Bowl</a> game in <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami, Florida</a> on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over Virginia Tech, <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Virginia Tech by five points.

In the opening quarter of the game, the Eagles took a 7–0 lead on a 51-yard <a href="fumble">fumble</a> <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23R">return</a> for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. The Eagles' offense dominated the first half of the game statistically, but failed to add to its early lead until the second quarter, when a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> made it 10–0. Virginia Tech answered with a touchdown of their own, but Boston College responded with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. Then came perhaps the most pivotal play of the game. During the <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown blocked the kick, which was caught by the Hokies' <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75 yards for a defensive <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>.

The play changed the momentum of the game. Virginia Tech added a tying touchdown before <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, and after a scoreless third quarter, two Matt Ryan <a href="interception">interception</a>s resulted in 14 points for Virginia Tech and a 30–16 Virginia Tech win. With the victory, the Hokies earned their second Atlantic Coast Conference football championship in four years and their first <a href="Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Orange Bowl</a> bid since 1996.

The <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> matches the winner of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Football">Coastal and Atlantic Divisions</a> of the Atlantic Coast Conference. A conference championship game was added in 2005, as a result of the league's expansion the previous year, adding former <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East</a> members <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami</a>, Virginia Tech, and <a href="Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football">Boston College</a>. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> rules.

<a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football">Florida State</a> defeated Virginia Tech, 27–22 in the <a href="2005%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">first ACC Championship game</a>. The following year, <a href="2006%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">the game</a>, held in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, pitted <a href="2007%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football%20team">Wake Forest</a> against <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a>, with Wake Forest winning 9–6. Before the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 season</a> began, most sports writers and pollsters predicted that Florida State would win the Atlantic Division while Virginia Tech would win the Coastal Division, setting up a rematch of the 2005 ACC Championship Game.

In October, Florida State lost back-to-back ACC conference games to Wake Forest and <a href="2007%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a>, eliminating them from contention for their division title. Boston College, which had finished second in the preseason Atlantic Division poll, was ranked No. 2 in the country after Florida State's loss to Miami. Virginia Tech, which suffered a 48–7 defeat at the hands of then-No. 2 <a href="2007%20LSU%20Tigers%20football%20team">LSU</a>, nevertheless remained at the top of the Coastal Division standings as the Eagles passed the Seminoles for the Atlantic Division lead.

On October 25, Boston College traveled to <a href="Blacksburg%2C%20Virginia">Blacksburg, Virginia</a>, home of Virginia Tech, for a Thursday night game broadcast on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>. In heavy rain, Virginia Tech's defense dominated for most of the game. As time ran down, however, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan orchestrated two late-game touchdown drives, scoring 14 points in the final 2 minutes to win 14–10. The victory seemingly sealed Boston College's route to a national championship game, while the loss potentially jeopardized Virginia Tech's chances of being selected to play in the ACC Championship Game. Over the next two weeks, however, Boston College was upset by Florida State and Maryland. The Eagles rallied to win their final two games—against Miami and <a href="2007%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a>—to clinch the division title. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, was undefeated through the remainder of its schedule, including a division-clinching win over its archrival, <a href="2007%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia</a>. This meant that the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville would be a rematch between these two division champions.

In the weeks leading up to the game, there was much media discussion of the future site of the game due to Jacksonville's expiring contract to host the ACC Championship. The media also discussed whether Virginia Tech would be out for revenge against Boston College after its last-second defeat in Blacksburg on October 25. Despite its previous loss, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game, with most favoring the Hokies by 4.5–5 points.

The game was the 15th contest between Boston College and Virginia Tech and was their second of the 2007 season. The first meeting, which took place in 1993 in the Big East conference, resulted in a 48–34 Boston College win. Between 1993 and 2003, Boston College and Virginia Tech played annually as part of their conference schedules. The teams did not meet in 2004 following Virginia Tech's move to the Atlantic Coast Conference. When Boston College followed in 2005, the schools resumed meeting during the regular season, playing in 2005, 2006, and 2007.

Following the <a href="2006%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2006 ACC Championship Game</a>, the Gator Bowl Association, which administered the ACC Championship Game during its first two years of existence, was awarded a one-year extension to its two-year contract to host the game. The <a href="2006%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2006 game</a> suffered from poor attendance, resulting in over $1 million in losses for the Gator Bowl Association. In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association declared that if sales did not improve for the 2007 ACC Championship game, the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced the same problem.

With Jacksonville's future as host in doubt, representatives from <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, and Jacksonville visited the ACC offices to lobby to host the <a href="2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2008 game</a>. <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>, which had been an early contender to host the 2008 game, was eliminated from consideration before the meetings took place. As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure with the poor ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000 tickets remained unsold as of the week of the game and that if it was not a sellout, the game would likely not remain in Jacksonville.

Media attention was also directed at the teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week leading up to the game. In the first half of the 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest offensive threat for Boston College.

Virginia Tech's offense was led by an unusual two-quarterback system, as junior <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> shared time with <a href="freshman">freshman</a> <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>. While Glennon proved to be a better <a href="passing%20pocket">pocket passer</a>, Taylor's quickness enabled him to scramble out of trouble and gain positive yardage even when no open receivers were available for <a href="Forward%20pass">pass</a>es. Until the final game of the season, either Taylor or Glennon was hampered by injury and limited the two-quarterback system's effectiveness. Although the two-quarterback system proved effective against Virginia, there were still questions about how well such an unusual setup would work in the ACC Championship Game.

On the ground, Taylor's offensive <a href="Quarterback%20scramble">scrambling</a>, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> weapon. <a href="Running%20back">Running back</a> <a href="Brandon%20Ore">Brandon Ore</a>, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, would need to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the <a href="2006%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">2006 season</a>, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006 performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006 form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.

The Boston College ground offense was led by <a href="running%20back%20%28American%20football%29">running back</a> Andre Callender, who had perhaps his biggest game of the year during the division-clinching match against Clemson two weeks earlier. In that game, Callender finished with 92 <a href="Reception%20%28American%20football%29">receiving</a> yards and 75 rushing yards. Due to the success of Matt Ryan's passing attack, however, Callender was used mostly as a backfield receiver and was the team's leading receiver statistically during the 2007 season. In the regular season, Callender amassed 905 yards rushing, 613 yards receiving, and 13 total touchdowns. Callender's normal backup, running back A.J. Brooks, was suspended for the ACC Championship Game.

Virginia Tech's defense was considered stronger than that of Boston College. For the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech returned senior <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Vince%20Hall">Vince Hall</a> to the starting lineup. Hall had sat out four straight games, including the previous Boston College match, after suffering a broken <a href="forearm">forearm</a> and <a href="wrist">wrist</a>. ESPN named Hall and <a href="Xavier%20Adibi">Xavier Adibi</a>, Tech's other senior linebacker, the "best linebacker duo in the country".

On Virginia Tech's defensive secondary, <a href="Brandon%20Flowers%20%28American%20football%29">Brandon Flowers</a>, one of Tech's starting <a href="cornerback%20%28American%20football%29">cornerback</a>s, was a second-team All-ACC defensive selection and had five interceptions in the season. Assisting Flowers would be <a href="Macho%20Harris">Victor "Macho" Harris</a>, who had also netted five interceptions during the regular season. During the 2007 season, <a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> called the two "maybe the finest cornerback duo in America."

At the end of the regular season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was recovering from a <a href="sprain">sprain</a>ed knee <a href="ligament">ligament</a>, it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the <a href="Bronko%20Nagurski%20Trophy">Bronko Nagurski Trophy</a> (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.

In addition, <a href="safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> <a href="Jamie%20Silva">Jamie Silva</a> would have to play a strong game to support the Boston College cornerback replacing the injured Tribble. Silva, an All-ACC defensive selection, led the team with five interceptions and was very good in moving up to stop the run as well. On the <a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a>, <a href="defensive%20end%20%28American%20football%29">defensive end</a> Nick Larkin was a quarterfinalist for the <a href="Lott%20Trophy">Lott Trophy</a>, an award given to the defensive player with the most "defensive impact" nationally.

The 2007 ACC Championship Game kicked off at 13:10 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. At kickoff, the weather was partly cloudy, with winds from the northeast at . The air temperature was . The official attendance estimate was 53,212, but by most accounts the actual attendance was far lower. Virginia Tech fans made up most of the crowd, and fewer than 5,000 Boston College fans were present at the game. The game was broadcast on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and netted a television rating of 4.1, placing it behind the <a href="2007%20SEC%20Championship%20Game">SEC Championship Game</a> and the <a href="Big%2012%20Football%20Championship%20Game">Big 12 Championship Game</a>, which earned ratings of 5.9 and 6.6, respectively.

The <a href="Marching%20Virginians">Marching Virginians</a>, Virginia Tech's <a href="marching%20band">marching band</a>, and the "Screaming Eagles", the <a href="Boston%20College%20Marching%20Band">Boston College Marching Band</a>, played the <a href="American%20national%20anthem">national anthem</a> before the game. The pre-game <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a> involved two members of the <a href="Wounded%20Warrior%20Project">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, a program that assists the physical rehabilitation of wounded American combat <a href="veteran">veteran</a>s returning to the United States from fighting overseas. One soldier from <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and another from <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> were chosen to throw the ceremonial coin that would determine the game's starting possession. Supervising the coin toss was <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29">referee</a> Jack Childress, who had also officiated the inaugural ACC Championship Game.

Virginia Tech won the opening coin toss and deferred its option to the second half. Boston College received the opening <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a>, which was downed in the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a> for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>. Starting at their own 20-yard line, the Eagles advanced down the field as quarterback Matt Ryan completed several passes and running back Andre Callender contributed several long runs. A <a href="pass%20interference">pass interference</a> call against Virginia Tech, coupled with a 10-yard run by Callender, put Boston College at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. After three consecutive <a href="incomplete%20pass">incomplete pass</a>es, Eagles kicker <a href="Steve%20Aponavicius">Steve Aponavicius</a> attempted a 36-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>. During the field goal, Virginia Tech <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> player <a href="Duane%20Brown">Duane Brown</a> broke through the Eagles' line and blocked the kick, giving Virginia Tech possession of the ball.

Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, began their first possession at their own 37-yard line. However, a <a href="quarterback%20sack">sack</a>, a <a href="Tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackle</a> for loss, and an incomplete pass denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage and they were forced to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a>. Tech punter <a href="Brent%20Bowden%20%28American%20football%29">Brent Bowden</a> managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start at their own 14-yard line, but three big plays of 16, 19, and 19 yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a <a href="Down%20%28American%20football%29">fourth down</a>. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an incomplete pass.

On the Hokies' second offensive possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor took the field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two <a href="Down%20%28American%20football%29">first downs</a> and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind the <a href="line%20of%20scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> and <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51 yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave Boston College a 7–0 lead with 4 minutes remaining in the quarter.

After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again failed to advance the ball. After a <a href="three-and-out">three-and-out</a>, the Hokies again punted. The ball traveled 44 yards, forcing the Eagles to start at their own 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, the Eagles drove the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the end of the first quarter, Boston College led 7–0.

At the beginning of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the <a href="goalposts">uprights</a>, giving Boston College a 10–0 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.

Virginia Tech's first offensive drive of the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to <a href="wide%20receiver%20%28American%20football%29">wide receiver</a> <a href="Josh%20Morgan">Josh Morgan</a>. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a <a href="American%20football%20rules%23Fouls%20and%20their%20penalties">personal foul</a>, which added 15 yards to the end of the pass. Another long pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech deep into the <a href="red%20zone%20%28gridiron%20football%29">red zone</a>, and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan. With 8:15 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech narrowed Boston College's lead to just three points.

On the ensuing possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under three minutes to travel 74 yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback scramble for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College <a href="offensive%20line">offensive line</a> and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced into the hands of Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75 yards for a defensive <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 16–9 in favor of Boston College.

Tech quarterback Sean Glennon's first pass of the new possession, long throw downfield, was intercepted by Boston College defender <a href="Jamie%20Silva">Jamie Silva</a>. The length of the pass meant that Boston College did not have good field position following the <a href="turnover%20%28football%29">turnover</a>. After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.

Beginning at their own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11 yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide receiver <a href="Eddie%20Royal">Eddie Royal</a> put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its <a href="Time-out%20%28sport%29">timeout</a>s to stop the clock and the first half from ending before they had a chance to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 16–16.

With no time left to mount an answering drive, Boston College received the kickoff and let time run out. Heading into <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, the two teams were tied, 16–16.

Because they deferred their selection to the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, and picked up two first downs, one through the air and the other on the ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.

Boston College, in their first possession of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard <a href="delay%20of%20game">delay of game</a> penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession that resulted in a punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.

After receiving the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, <a href="down%20%28American%20football%29">turning the ball over on downs</a>. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.

The Hokies were forced to punt again, and Brent Bowden's 50-yard punt stuck the Eagles deep in their own territory. The drive began with a five-yard penalty against Boston College and culminated two plays later in a six-yard loss on a sack of Matt Ryan by Hokie defender Barry Booker. Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers traveled just 34 yards before sailing <a href="out%20of%20bounds">out of bounds</a>.

Virginia Tech had good starting field position at their own 44-yard line. One quick first down later, the clock ran out on the third quarter. As neither team had scored in the quarter, the score remained tied at 16–16.

Despite starting almost at midfield, the offensive drive that began at the end of the third quarter failed to reach field goal range, and the Hokies were forced to punt. Boston College's offense fared no better, however, and punted after a <a href="three-and-out">three-and-out</a> possession. The ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line, and the Hokies began their first full offensive possession of the fourth quarter.

After an incomplete pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies got their first big offensive break of the second half. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31 yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23 more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points of the second half and gave Virginia Tech a 23–16 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.

Boston College began its second possession of the fourth quarter knowing it had to score a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> to tie the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan had his best success of the day, connecting on seven of ten passes during the drive and picking up 58 yards. All of the Eagles' yardage on the drive came through the air, and with 2:25 remaining, the Eagles found themselves at the Virginia Tech 14-yard line. Facing a fourth down and needing four yards for a first down, Matt Ryan fell back to attempt a pass. The throw was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Vince Hall.

Starting at its own 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three straight running plays in an effort to run the clock down and prevent Boston College from having enough time to conduct another offensive drive. After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28 seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a two-point conversion.
The Boston College drive began on its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, Boston College would have to complete one or more <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">Hail Mary pass</a>es. Although the odds of completing one such pass, let alone several, were very low, many Virginia Tech fans remained worried, as Boston College had previously beaten the Hokies in similar circumstances earlier in the season. Matt Ryan's first two passes fell incomplete, and his third was <a href="interception">intercepted</a> by Virginia Tech's <a href="Xavier%20Adibi">Xavier Adibi</a> and returned 40 yards for a Virginia Tech touchdown.

The score came with 11 seconds remaining and gave Virginia Tech its final lead, 30–16. With no chance to win, Boston College elected to let the clock run out after receiving the <a href="kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a>. Virginia Tech won the 2007 ACC Championship, 30–16.

Virginia Tech <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> was named the game's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a>. Glennon finished the game having completed 18 of his 27 passes, earning 174 passing yards, three <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s (18 points), and one <a href="interception">interception</a>. Boston College quarterback <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a> had finished 33 of 52 for 305 yards and two interceptions, no passing touchdowns, and one rushing touchdown.

Each team finished with two <a href="Turnover%20%28football%29">turnovers</a>—Virginia Tech fumbled the ball once and threw one <a href="interception">interception</a>, while Boston College's offense threw two. Each team earned seven points off of turnovers, and Virginia Tech <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29%23Missed%20and%20blocked%20field%20goals">blocked</a> two kicks. The two blocked kicks effectively netted five points for Virginia Tech, as the blocked field goal prevented Boston College from scoring three points, and the other blocked kick was returned 75 yards for a rare defensive <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>. The two blocked kicks by Virginia Tech were the first and second blocked kicks in ACC Championship Game history, and Boston College's fumble return for a touchdown was the first fumble recovery and defensive touchdown in ACC Championship Game history.

Two-thirds of Virginia Tech's 300 <a href="total%20offense">total offensive</a> yardage came via passes from quarterbacks Sean Glennon (174 yards) and Tyrod Taylor (28 yards). Glennon's three passing <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s tied an ACC Championship Game record set by former Virginia Tech quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> in <a href="2005%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2005</a>. Glennon also set the ACC Championship Game record for pass completion percentage (66.7%) by completing 18 of his 27 passes. Taylor, meanwhile, set ACC Championship Game records for longest run and longest quarterback run with a 31-yard scramble in the second quarter that helped set up the tying touchdown for Virginia Tech. Taylor finished the game with 36 <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> yards, the third-most of any player in the game.

On the ground, Taylor's performance was supplemented by Tech <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Branden Ore, who led all rushers with 55 yards on 19 <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushes</a>. Fourteen of Ore's 55 yards came on a single play halfway through the fourth quarter when the Boston College's defensive line gave way, admitting Tech's runner into the <a href="Defensive%20back">defensive secondary</a>. The run helped set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown later in the fourth quarter. Capping Tech's ground game were complimentary performances by Kenny Lewis and Sean Glennon, each of whom earned fewer than 10 yards, but picked up first downs on two plays.

Leading all Tech <a href="Wide%20receiver">receivers</a> was Josh Morgan, who caught eight passes for 55 yards and a touchdown. Eddie Royal also had an excellent game for the Hokies, catching two long passes of 18 yards and 11 yards on subsequent plays in the second quarter. Royal's 2 catches drove the Hokies deep into Boston College territory, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman that tied the game at <a href="halftime">halftime</a>. Royal's biggest play, however, came halfway through the fourth quarter when he caught the go-ahead touchdown pass from Sean Glennon. The 24-yard reception was Royal's longest catch of the day, and the touchdown gave the Hokies a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the game.

Though its offense performed well, it was Virginia Tech's <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> and <a href="American%20football%20strategy%23Defensive%20strategy">defense</a> that earned it the win. Duane Brown's twin <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29%23Missed%20and%20blocked%20field%20goals">blocked kick</a>s were the first blocks recorded in ACC Championship Game history and were the 116th and 117th blocked kicks recorded at Virginia Tech under head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a>. In addition to the blocks, Tech special teams excelled on punts and <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a>s. Tech punter Brent Bowden finished the day with seven punts for a total of 324 yards. A 54-yard kick in the first quarter was the fourth-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.

On <a href="American%20football%20strategy%23Defensive%20strategy">defense</a>, <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> Vince Hall, in his second game after recovering from a broken <a href="forearm">forearm</a>, led all defensive players with 11 <a href="Tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackle</a>s. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech to run down the clock and force Boston College into a hasty offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40 yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.

Though Boston College lost the game on the scoreboard, it won almost every statistical category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305 yards. Ryan was extremely accurate through the air in the fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record. Ryan also was surprisingly successful on the ground, <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing</a> for Boston College's touchdown of the game—a 14-yard sprint in the second quarter that put Boston College ahead 16–7.

In the first half, the Eagles offense recorded 20 first downs. In the second half, it managed just four first downs, three of which came in one drive in the fourth quarter. As a result of second-half pressure from Virginia Tech, Ryan was forced into two late-game <a href="interception">interception</a>s, including one that was returned for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown.

Ryan finished the game with 35 rushing yards, just one short of Hokie quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been highly promoted as a runner heading into the game. Ryan finished fourth among all rushers, and Eagle running back Andre Callender, the sole running back on the Eagles' roster, finished second, rushing for 51 yards in the game. Callender game-long 11-yard run helped set up the Eagles for a field goal attempt early in the second quarter.

Callender's true success, however, was in the passing game, where he accrued 92 yards, putting him first among all receivers in the game. Callender's 13 catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for a receiver in any game in ACC history. Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4 catches for 45 yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54 yards. Surprisingly for the number of <a href="Reception%20%28American%20football%29">receiving</a> yards recorded by the Eagles in the game, no Boston College receiver caught a touchdown.

Boston College punter Johnny Ayres kicked four <a href="pun">pun</a>ts a total of 159 yards, including one long kick that traveled 55 yards and set the mark for the third-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history. Kicker Steve Aponavicius successfully kicked a 37-yard field goal early in the second quarter. but after his second kick was blocked, Boston College head coach <a href="Jeff%20Jagodzinski">Jeff Jagodzinski</a> seemed reluctant to try long field goals and instead sent in the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. Out of four tries, only one fourth down was converted into a first down.

On <a href="American%20football%20strategy%23Defensive%20strategy">defense</a>, Boston College had more success than predicted by pre-game coverage. Jamie Silva's fumble return for a touchdown was the first defensive score in ACC Championship Game history. Silva finished the game with five <a href="Tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackle</a>s (one for loss), one <a href="interception">interception</a>, the forced fumble, and the defensive touchdown. DeLeon Gause, meanwhile, was the Eagles' leading tackler, recording 10 stops including one tackle for loss. Altogether, the Eagles recorded four sacks and nine tackles for loss, holding the <a href="Hokie">Hokie</a> offense in check for most of the game.

Virginia Tech's victory in the ACC Championship Game had far-reaching sporting consequences for the <a href="NCAA%20football%20bowl%20games%2C%202007-08">2007–2008 college football bowl season</a> and in the future site of the ACC Championship Game. The 2007 game injected approximately $10 million into the Jacksonville economy. Thousands of hotel rooms were filled by fans traveling to the game, and the impact they created was larger than that of the previous year's game, which featured teams that had shorter distances to travel and whose fans had generated less demand for overnight accommodation. Despite the fact that fans spent more in 2007 than at any previous ACC Championship Game, poor ticket sales at the box office necessitated a move.

After poor attendance in the ACC Championship Game at Jacksonville for the second straight year, ACC officials and representatives of the conference's member schools elected not to extend the Gator Bowl Association's contract to host the game. On December 12, the ACC announced that <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a> would host the game in 2008 and 2009 and <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> would host the game in 2010 and 2011.

The cities were chosen based on bids presented to the ACC and its member schools. Each city requested and was granted a two-year contract, locking the ACC into the locations well in advance of the actual games. Tampa was chosen as the site of the 2008 game because Charlotte was scheduled to hold the annual <a href="Convention%20%28meeting%29">convention</a> of the <a href="Association%20for%20Career%20and%20Technical%20Education">Association for Career and Technical Education</a> at the same time as the game, and adequate hotel space would not be ready in time for the two events.

With its win, Virginia Tech clinched an automatic bid to the <a href="2008%20Orange%20Bowl">2008 Orange Bowl</a>. This caused ripple effects in the bowl destinations for virtually every bowl-eligible ACC team. In the 2007 season, the ACC had guaranteed tie-ins with eight bowl games.

The ACC's representatives to these bowls were picked in a hierarchical system that allowed the <a href="2007%20Chick-fil-A%20Bowl">Chick-fil-A Bowl</a> to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of the winner of the ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, <a href="Champs%20Sports%20Bowl">Champs Sports Bowl</a>, <a href="Music%20City%20Bowl">Music City Bowl</a>, <a href="Belk%20Bowl">Meineke Car Care Bowl</a>, <a href="Emerald%20Bowl">Emerald Bowl</a>, and <a href="Humanitarian%20Bowl">Humanitarian Bowl</a>, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 5–3 team over a 6–2 team, but could not select a 4–4 team over a 6–2 team.

With Virginia Tech earning an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, the Chick-fil-A Bowl had the first pick of the remaining ACC teams. Boston College, by virtue of its loss in the ACC Championship Game, was the highest remaining team, but Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives instead chose to invite Clemson, which had finished behind Boston College in the Atlantic Division standings. In making their decision, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives cited Boston College's poor attendance at the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville. The Gator Bowl, which is also held in Jacksonville, was reluctant to choose a team that had participated in the ACC Championship Game out of feat that the team's fans would be unwilling to return to Jacksonville so quickly. The Gator Bowl Association requested and received a waiver from the league's strict bowl selection rules and selected Virginia over Boston College.

The Champs Sports Bowl was thus forced to select Boston College. Boston College players and fans, owing to the decreased status of the Champs Sports Bowl when compared with the Orange, Chick-fil-A, and Gator Bowls, were disappointed with the selection and match against Michigan State. Had Boston College won the ACC Championship Game, it would have earned the automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, and Virginia Tech would have been selected by the Chick-fil-A Bowl, which had earlier expressed an interest in inviting the Hokies to the game for a <a href="2006%20Chick-fil-A%20Bowl">second straight year</a>. Clemson would have been bumped down to the Gator Bowl, and Virginia would have been forced into the Champs Sports Bowl.

2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season had the earliest <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> since <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20South-West%20Indian%20Ocean%20cyclone%20season">1992</a>. Many storms formed in the north-east portion of the basin, and several more originated around Australia. The basin is defined as the waters of the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> west of longitude <a href="90th%20meridian%20east">90°E</a> to the coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and south of the <a href="equator">equator</a>. Eleven tropical storms formed, compared to an average of nine. Tropical systems were present during 73 days, which was significantly higher than the average of 58.

Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the <a href="Regional%20Specialized%20Meteorological%20Center">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> (RSMC) in <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>. The season started on November 1, 2001, and ended on April 30, 2002; for <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>, the season continued until May 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin; however, storms formed both before and after the designated season. The first storm was Andre, which emerged from the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Australian%20region%20cyclone%20season">Australian basin</a> as Tropical Cyclone Alex in late October. The strongest storm, <a href="Cyclone%20Hary">Cyclone Hary</a>, was the first <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23South-Western%20Indian%20Ocean">very intense tropical cyclone</a> since 2000; it hit Madagascar, where it caused lighter damage than expected but three deaths. In January, <a href="Cyclone%20Dina">Cyclone Dina</a> left heavy damage in the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene Islands</a>, particularly on <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, where it dropped of rainfall. The final storm was <a href="Cyclone%20Kesiny">Cyclone Kesiny</a>, which killed 33 people when it struck Madagascar in the midst of a political crisis.

<a href="M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France">Météo-France</a>'s meteorological office in <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> (MFR) is the official <a href="Regional%20Specialized%20Meteorological%20Center">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> for the South-West Indian Ocean, tracking all tropical cyclones from the east coast of Africa to <a href="90th%20meridian%20west">90° E</a>. The <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC), which is a joint <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> – <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region, also issued advisories for storms during the season. Following the season, the start of the tropical cyclone year was changed to July 1, which defines the boundary between tropical cyclone seasons.

Although the previous season was tame, the 2001–02 season was very active and featured several intense <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s. During the season, eleven systems were named, which was slightly above the average of nine. However, nine of the systems attained <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23South-Western%20Indian%20Ocean">cyclone intensity</a>, the second highest total in 30 years. In terms of both the number of systems and number of "cyclone days", the season was considered comparable by MFR to the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20South-West%20Indian%20Ocean%20cyclone%20season">1993–94 season</a>. In this season, there were 73 days on which tropical cyclones were active, which was more than twice as much as the previous season and 19 days above the average. A system of cyclone intensity was active on 35 days, which was 15 days above the mean. Additionally, five of the systems attained "intense tropical cyclone" status, including one – <a href="Cyclone%20Hary">Hary</a> – that attained the "very intense tropical cyclone" stage. Activity was relatively distributed throughout the season and had the earliest start since 1992. Like most seasons within the <a href="South-West%20Indian%20Ocean%20tropical%20cyclone%20climatology">basin</a>, activity reached a climax in late January. Several systems during the season developed in the eastern portion of the basin, similar to 1993–94; unlike that season, many storms in 2001–02 stayed at sea throughout their lifetime, thus reducing casualties and damage.

The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Meteorology">Bureau of Meteorology</a> (BoM) classified a tropical low as Tropical Cyclone Alex on October 26 in the Australian region. It was initially located in an area of strong <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, which prevented significant strengthening. However, convection over the system increased on October 27, and it crossed into the South-West Indian Ocean at around the same time. It was renamed Andre, becoming the earliest date for the first named storm since 1992. After reaching <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">10‑minute sustained winds</a> of 100 km/h (65 mph), according to the MFR, Andre began slowly weakening, due to increasing shear. It moved generally to the west-southwest before turning northwestward on October 29, around which time the convection separated from the center. Moving slowly, Andre later turned to the southwest after weakening to a tropical depression. Late on October 31, the system was no longer classifiable as a tropical system, and the remnants continued to the west-southwest until being absorbed by a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> on November 8.

The <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> spawned a tropical low on November 24 in the Australian basin. It moved to the southwest, strengthening into Tropical Cyclone Bessi on November 27. Two days later, it moved into the South-West Indian Ocean, and was renamed "Bako" on December 1. Located in a similar position to the previous storm, Bako strengthened into a severe tropical storm on December 1, aided by warm waters and slack wind shear. The storm turned to the southeast on December 2, despite predictions to the contrary, and later that day it intensified further into a tropical cyclone, the first of the season. However, on December 3, Bako weakened back into a severe tropical storm due to much cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing northwesterly wind shear. It weakened into a tropical depression on December 5, before transitioning into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> the same day. RSMC La Reunion continued to track the remnants of Bako until December 9.
On December 25, a cold front dragged over the central Mozambique Channel. A weak circulation formed in the Channel and moderate convection appeared on December 27. Then on December 30, RSMC La Reunion designated this low pressure as a zone of disturbed weather and was classified as a tropical depression on January 1, 2002. The JTWC also issued a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> (TCFA) early on December 31 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S the next day. As it moved further eastwards it strengthened quickly from a tropical depression into a severe tropical storm, with the Meteorological Services of Madagascar giving it the name Cyprien on January 1. Cyprien soon became a serious threat to western Madagascar. Convection began to dissipate as wind shear increased and that resulted in quick weakening to a tropical depression. As it made landfall on western Madagascar, it dropped heavy rainfall.
In all, Cyprien destroyed 841 homes in the towns of <a href="Morombe">Morombe</a> and <a href="Morondava">Morondava</a>. Damage in the towns was estimated at $180,000, but there were no deaths.
Cyclone Dina originated in a tropical disturbance first noted on January 15 near the <a href="Chagos%20Archipelago">Chagos Archipelago</a>. By January 17, the system had developed enough organized <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. <a href="Rapid%20deepening">Rapid intensification</a> occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph) on January 18. Dina peaked in intensity on January 20 as an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 210 km/h (130 mph). Hours later, the storm bypassed <a href="Rodrigues%20Island">Rodrigues Island</a> about to its north. On January 21, the storm brushed <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and Réunion as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on January 25. The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were absorbed into a <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">polar trough</a> on January 28.

Across Mauritius and Réunion, torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to "catastrophic" damage. The entire island of Mauritius lost power during the storm and widespread structural damage took place. Agricultural and property damage amounted to US$47 million and US$50 million respectively in the republic. Nine fatalities were attributed to the storm in Mauritius: five off the coast of Rodrigues Island and four on the main island. More extensive damage was seen on Réunion where up to of rain fell over three days. Flooding destroyed many homes, washed out roads, and caused catastrophic agricultural damage. Destructive winds, measured at up to , also crippled communications. In all, six people died on the island and losses were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million).

A system developed within a <a href="convergence%20zone">convergence zone</a> on January 20 near the boundary between the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January 22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January 23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January 24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January 26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January 28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January 30.

The origins of Francesca were from a tropical low that formed in the Australia region on January 28, east of the <a href="Cocos%20Islands">Cocos Islands</a>. This was near the same place that Eddy had formed a week prior. The system that became Francesca moved west-southwestward due to a ridge to the south. On January 30 it crossed into the South-West Indian Ocean, where wind shear prevented significant development. On January 31, the system intensified into a tropical depression, and late the next day the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S. Wind shear diminished on February 2, which allowed the depression to strengthen into Tropical Storm Francesca after convection increased. It continued to intensify steadily, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 3. The next day, the JTWC upgraded Francesca to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.

An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast, and Francesca quickly developed a well-defined eye. It rapidly strengthened into an intense tropical cyclone, and reached peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on February 4, according to MFR. The JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 215 km/h (135 mph) when the storm was located about 1065 km (660 mi) southeast of <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>. Shortly after peaking, Francesca began weakening, losing its eye, until being a minimal tropical cyclone on February 7. That day, it re-intensified slightly and redeveloped an eye, although it was short-lived. Increasing shear again weakened Francesca, and on February 9 the cyclone deteriorated to a tropical storm. Cooler waters caused further weakening, which diminished convection over the center. On February 11, Francesca became extratropical, and the remnants turned to the southwest, dissipating on February 14.

On February 13, several low pressure areas were located over east-central Madagascar, with an area of convection that extended northwestward across the country toward <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a>. The system dropped heavy rainfall, reaching in <a href="Toamasina">Tamatave</a> in a 12‑hour period. In <a href="Mamoudzou">Mamoudzou</a>, the capital of <a href="Mayotte">Mayotte</a>, rainfall reached in 24 hours, which caused some damage on the island including a bridge collapse. A developing center gradually became better organized, and it took an unusual track offshore toward the northeast, steered by a ridge over Madagascar. On February 14, MFR classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather, upgrading it to a tropical disturbance the next day. Late on February 15, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 15S, and early the next day MFR upgraded it to Tropical Depression 10. Shortly thereafter, the Meteorological Services of Madagascar upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Guillame.

Late on February 16, Guillame began developing a small <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>, turning to the east around the same time. With favorable conditions, including good outflow, the system quickly intensified into a compact tropical cyclone as it turned to the southeast. Strengthening briefly stopped on February 17, possible due to an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, although it resumed the following day. Guillame curved to the south and southwest, reaching peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) late on February 18; this made it an intense tropical cyclone. The next day, the cyclone passed about east of Mauritius before an approaching trough turned it to the southeast. Despite the storm's proximity to the island, effects there were modest, marked by winds of and of rain. The cyclone began weakening due to increased wind shear, and deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on February 21. A strengthening ridge turned Guillame toward the northwest, and the storm dissipated on February 23.
Cyclone Hary was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. Developing on March 5 from the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a>, the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified. With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March 7, developing an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> and well-defined <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) on March 10 just offshore of eastern Madagascar, which made it the first <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23South-Western%20Indian%20Ocean">very intense tropical cyclone</a> since 2000.

After peaking, Hary weakened due to land interaction, and it struck Madagascar southeast of <a href="Antalaha">Antalaha</a>. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three deaths in the country, one of which was from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>. On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000 people were left without power. Hary became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on March 13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.

On March 21, a tropical disturbance quickly developed in the monsoon trough in the south-central Indian Ocean, about 1250 km (775 mi) east of Diego Garcia. A ridge to the south steered the system to the west-southwest, and moderate wind shear in the region prevented significant strengthening. The convection slowly organized, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ikala early on March 25. By that time, the shear had decreased, although initially it was strong enough to prevent the convection from covering the center. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the southeast on March 25, where upper-level conditions became more favorable for strengthening. Thunderstorms increased over the center, and an eye began developing on March 26. The next day, Ikala intensified into a tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) according to MFR; the JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). Shortly after peaking, increased wind shear and drier air from the <a href="weather%20front">front</a> quickly weakened Ikala, and it deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on March 28. That day, the center became exposed from the convection, and on March 29 Ikala became extratropical. The remnants turned to the southwest before recurving to the southeast on March 31, and Ikala was absorbed by a cold front on April 3.

In early April, the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression early on April 7 to the northeast of the <a href="Cocos%20Islands">Cocos Islands</a> in the Australian basin. It moved to the southwest due to a ridge along the west coast of Australia, and quickly intensified into Tropical Cyclone Dianne. Favorable conditions allowed for continued strengthening, and the storm developed a small eye late on April 7. The next day, the storm entered into South-West Indian Ocean and was renamed Jery. Shortly thereafter it intensified into a tropical cyclone, although by that time, the conditions were no longer as favorable for rapid intensification. On April 9, MFR estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph); around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph).

While at peak intensity, Jery began turning to the south, due to reaching the western edge of a ridge. An approaching trough increased wind shear over the storm, causing the convection to diminish and expose the center. Late on April 10 it weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the next day Jery became extratropical. Shortly thereafter the remnants crossed into the Australian region, dissipating on April 13.
Cyclone Kesiny was the final named storm of the season, forming near the equator on May 2, within a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> enhanced by a pulse of the <a href="Madden%E2%80%93Julian%20oscillation">Madden–Julian oscillation</a> that sparked three other storms. Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a>. On May 6, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen. However, Kesiny developed an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9, reaching peak winds of before striking <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> about southeast of <a href="Antsiranana">Antsiranana</a>. This made it the first recorded <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23South-Western%20Indian%20Ocean">tropical cyclone</a> to make landfall in the month of May in the basin. It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May 11.

Across Madagascar, Cyclone Kesiny dropped heavy rainfall, reaching in three days at <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> (the second largest city in the country). The rains caused mudslides and flooding in the eastern portion of the country, wrecking the rice and <a href="maize">maize</a> crops and leaving 5,000 people homeless. At least 33 bridges were destroyed, and many roads were damaged. A total of 33 people were killed, and 1,200 people were injured. The cyclone struck in the midst of a political crisis, in which the top two candidates of the <a href="Malagasy%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">Malagasy presidential election in 2001</a> declared themselves the winner; the incumbent, who lost, attempted to declare Toamasina the new capital city, and the political instability disrupted relief efforts.

The first storm of the season originated from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001. Moving southwestward, it slowly organized, with convection developing around a weak circulation. Late on October 3, MFR classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather. On October 5, the agency re-classified it as a tropical disturbance and later as Tropical Depression 1. The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear, although it had good outflow. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600 UTC on October 6, estimating winds of about 65 km/h (40 mph). Due to the shear, the convection gradually diminished, prompting the MFR to downgrade it to a tropical disturbance on October 7. The next day, the JTWC issued its last advisory, noting that the system was dissipating.

A zone of disturbed weather formed on November 15 in the eastern part of the basin. It remained a zone of disturbed weather for a few days before briefly strengthening into a tropical depression on November 21. It dissipated two days later. This system was also designated as tropical cyclone by the JTWC.

On February 5, a tropical low developed in the Mozambique Channel. Classified as Tropical Disturbance 9 by MFR, the system moved southeastward, dissipating on February 6. The season ended with a tropical disturbance, which formed on June 13 to the east-southeast of Diego Garcia. It moved to the south, and was last monitored on June 15.

A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of <a href="55th%20meridian%20east">55°E</a>, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> assigns the appropriate name to the storm; between 55°E and <a href="90th%20meridian%20east">90°E</a>, the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> is responsible for the same task. A new annual list is used every year so no names are retired.
This table lists all of the tropical cyclones and <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a>s that were monitored during the 2001–2002 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. Information on their intensity, duration, name, and areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC La Reunion. Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2002 USD.

Introduction to viruses

A virus is a biological agent that <a href="reproduction">reproduces</a> inside the <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> of living <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a>. When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell. But unlike <a href="prion">still simpler infectious agents</a>, viruses contain <a href="Introduction%20to%20genetics">genes</a>, which gives them the ability to mutate and evolve. Over 5,000 species of viruses have been discovered.

The origins of viruses are unclear: some may have <a href="evolution">evolved</a> from <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. A virus consists of two or three parts: <a href="gene">gene</a>s, made from either <a href="DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="RNA">RNA</a>, long <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s that carry genetic information; a <a href="protein">protein</a> coat that protects the genes; and in some viruses, an <a href="viral%20envelope">envelope</a> of fat that surrounds the protein coat and is used, in combination with specific receptors, to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple <a href="tobacco%20mosaic%20virus">helical</a> and <a href="icosahedron">icosahedral</a> to more <a href="bacteriophage">complex</a> structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to .

Viruses spread in many ways. Just as many viruses are very specific as to which host species or tissue they attack, each <a href="species">species</a> of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other <a href="organism">organism</a>s, known as "<a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>s". Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as <a href="influenza">influenza</a> are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as <a href="norovirus">norovirus</a> are transmitted by the <a href="fecal%E2%80%93oral%20route">faecal–oral route</a>, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. <a href="Rotavirus">Rotavirus</a> is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the <a href="Dengue%20virus">Dengue virus</a>, are spread by blood-sucking insects.

Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and even plants. However, they are usually eliminated by the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>, conferring lifetime <a href="Immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> to the host for that virus. <a href="Antibiotic">Antibiotic</a>s have no effect on viruses, but <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. <a href="Vaccine">Vaccine</a>s that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some viral infections.

In 1884 the French <a href="microbiologist">microbiologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Chamberland">Charles Chamberland</a> invented a filter, known today as the <a href="Chamberland%20filter">Chamberland filter</a> or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian <a href="biologist">biologist</a> <a href="Dmitri%20Ivanovsky">Dmitri Ivanovsky</a> used this filter to study what became known as the <a href="tobacco%20mosaic%20virus">tobacco mosaic virus</a>. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.

At the same time several other scientists proved that, although these agents (later called "viruses") were different from bacteria, they could still cause disease, and they were about one hundredth the size of bacteria. In 1899 the Dutch microbiologist <a href="Martinus%20Beijerinck">Martinus Beijerinck</a> observed that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells. Having failed to demonstrate its particulate nature, he called it a ""<a href="contagium%20vivum%20fluidum">contagium vivum fluidum</a>"", a "soluble living germ". In the early 20th century the English <a href="bacteriologist">bacteriologist</a> <a href="Frederick%20Twort">Frederick Twort</a> discovered viruses that infect bacteria, and the French-Canadian microbiologist <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20d%27Herelle">Félix d'Herelle</a> described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on <a href="agar">agar</a>, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria. Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.

With the invention of the <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a> in 1931 by the German engineers <a href="Ernst%20Ruska">Ernst Ruska</a> and <a href="Max%20Knoll">Max Knoll</a> came the first images of viruses. In 1935 American <a href="biochemist">biochemist</a> and <a href="virologist">virologist</a> <a href="Wendell%20Meredith%20Stanley">Wendell Meredith Stanley</a> examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a> <a href="Ernest%20William%20Goodpasture">Ernest William Goodpasture</a> and <a href="Alice%20Miles%20Woodruff">Alice Miles Woodruff</a> grew <a href="influenza">influenza</a> and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when <a href="John%20Franklin%20Enders">John Franklin Enders</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Huckle%20Weller">Thomas Huckle Weller</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Chapman%20Robbins">Frederick Chapman Robbins</a> grew <a href="polio%20virus">polio virus</a> in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.

Viruses co-exist with life wherever it occurs. They have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses remains unclear because they do not form fossils, so <a href="Molecular%20biology">molecular techniques</a> have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old. Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century. Three main theories speculate on the origins of viruses:




There are problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis does not explain the structures of virus particles. The coevolution, or virus-first hypothesis, contravenes the definition of viruses, in that they are dependent on host cells. But viruses are recognised as ancient and to have origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the <a href="Three-domain%20system">three domains</a>. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.

A virus particle, also known as a <a href="virion">virion</a>, consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a <a href="capsid">capsid</a>. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be <a href="truncated%20icosahedron">icosahedral</a> (20-sided), <a href="helix">helical</a> or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the <a href="nucleocapsid">nucleocapsid</a>, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of <a href="lipid">lipid</a> (fat) called an <a href="viral%20envelope">envelope</a>.

Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and most of them can only be seen by <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscopy</a>. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are <a href="Optical%20microscope%23Limitations">sub-microscopic</a>); their sizes range from 20 to 300 <a href="Nanometre">nm</a>. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm. By contrast <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l sizes are typically around 1 micrometre (1000 nm) in diameter, and the <a href="Cell%20biology">cells</a> of higher organisms a few tens of micrometres. Some viruses such as <a href="megavirus">megavirus</a>es and <a href="pandoravirus">pandoravirus</a>es are relatively large. At around 1 <a href="micrometre">micrometer</a>, these viruses, which infect <a href="amoeba">amoeba</a>e, were discovered in 2003 and 2013. They are around a thousand times larger than <a href="influenza%20virus">influenza virus</a>es and the discovery of these "giant" viruses astonished scientists.

Genes are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The biological information contained in an organism is <a href="Genetic%20code">encoded</a> in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but <a href="RNA%20virus">many viruses</a> have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.

Viruses reproduce rapidly because they have only a few genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and <a href="rotavirus">rotavirus</a> has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.

All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s called <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> and <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a> which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.

In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called <a href="reassortment">reassortment</a>.

Proteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. <a href="Protein%20biosynthesis">Protein synthesis</a> consists of two major steps: <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> and <a href="Translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a>.

Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a>, is used to produce RNA copies called <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.

Some nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called <a href="Sense%20%28molecular%20biology%29">negative-sense</a> RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called <a href="retrovirus">retrovirus</a>es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.

When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.

There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:


The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive. These are called "cytopathic effects". Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> (cell "suicide"). Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle.

Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell. Cells in which the virus is <a href="virus%20latency">latent</a> and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This is often the case with <a href="herpes%20simplex">herpes viruses</a>.

Some viruses, such as <a href="Epstein-Barr%20virus">Epstein-Barr virus</a>, often cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy; but some other viruses, such as <a href="papillomavirus">papillomavirus</a>, are an established cause of cancer.
When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus, and if the cell cannot <a href="DNA%20repair">repair</a> itself, this often triggers apoptosis. One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, for example, does this.

Common human diseases caused by viruses include the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>, <a href="influenza">the flu</a>, <a href="chickenpox">chickenpox</a> and <a href="cold%20sores">cold sores</a>. Serious diseases such as <a href="Ebola">Ebola</a> and <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be "benign". The more harmful viruses are described as <a href="virulence">virulent</a>.
Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.
Some viruses can cause lifelong or <a href="Chronic%20%28medical%29">chronic</a> infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in <a href="hepatitis%20B%20virus">hepatitis B virus</a> and <a href="hepatitis%20C%20virus">hepatitis C virus</a> infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If there is a high proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a>.

There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by <a href="organism">organism</a>s; such organisms are called <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>s. Some viruses that infect animals, including humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as <a href="norovirus">norovirus</a> and <a href="rotavirus">rotavirus</a>, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal <a href="fomites">objects</a> and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated <a href="hypodermic%20needle">hypodermic needle</a>s. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.

There are many types of <a href="plant%20virus">plant virus</a>, but often they only cause a loss of <a href="crop%20yield">yield</a>, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by <a href="organism">organism</a>s (<a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>s). These are normally insects, but some <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="Nematode">nematode worms</a> and <a href="protozoa">single-celled organisms</a> have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>. The <a href="International%20Committee%20on%20Taxonomy%20of%20Viruses">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families. They are important in <a href="marine%20ecology">marine ecology</a>: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by <a href="Industrial%20fermentation">fermentation</a> and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.

Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This <a href="innate">innate</a> immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a "memory" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called <a href="interferon">interferon</a> is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a>. Some blood cells <a href="phagocytosis">engulf</a> and destroy other virus infected cells.

Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a "memory" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called <a href="antibody">antibodies</a>. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection; however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.

Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called <a href="Gene-for-gene%20relationship%23Classes%20of%20resistance%20gene">resistance (R) genes</a>. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which destroy viruses, such as <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>, <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a> and <a href="Reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen molecules</a>.

The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called <a href="restriction%20endonucleases">restriction endonucleases</a>, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.

Vaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in the eradication of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as <a href="polio">polio</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a>, <a href="mumps">mumps</a> and <a href="rubella">rubella</a>. Vaccines are available to prevent over fourteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to <a href="Immunodeficiency">people with weak immunity</a>. In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce "designer" vaccines that only have the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. These vaccines are safer because they can never cause the disease.

Since the mid 1980s, the development of <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>. Antiviral drugs are often <a href="nucleoside%20analogue">nucleoside analogue</a>s, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are <a href="aciclovir">aciclovir</a> for <a href="Herpesviridae">herpes virus</a> infections and <a href="lamivudine">lamivudine</a> for HIV and <a href="hepatitis%20B%20virus">hepatitis B virus</a> infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.

Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the <a href="HIV-1%20protease">HIV-1 protease</a> for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called <a href="protease%20inhibitors">protease inhibitors</a>, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes <a href="Chronic%20%28medical%29">chronic</a>, and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug <a href="ribavirin">ribavirin</a> combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic <a href="Asymptomatic%20carrier">carrier</a>s of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using <a href="lamivudine">lamivudine</a> and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.

HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million of them in a teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.

Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s, which often kill other marine life.
The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.

Their effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 <a href="gigatonne">gigatonne</a>s of carbon per year.

Marine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by <a href="phocine%20distemper%20virus">phocine distemper virus</a>. Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations.

Battle of Musa Qala

The Battle of Musa Qala (also Qaleh or Qal'eh) was a British led military action in <a href="Helmand%20Province">Helmand Province</a>, southern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, launched by the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a> and the <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) against the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> on 7 December 2007. After three days of intense fighting, the Taliban retreated into the mountains on 10 December. <a href="Musa%20Qala">Musa Qala</a> was officially reported captured on 12 December, with Afghan Army troops pushing into the town centre.

The operation was codenamed "snakepit" (). Senior ISAF officers, including U.S. general <a href="Dan%20K.%20McNeill">Dan K. McNeill</a>, the overall ISAF commander, agreed to the assault on 17 November 2007. It followed more than nine months of Taliban occupation of the town, the largest the insurgents controlled at the time of the battle. ISAF forces had previously occupied the town, until a controversial withdrawal in late 2006.

It was the first battle in the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a> in which Afghan army units were the principal fighting force. Statements from the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) emphasised that the operation was Afghan-led, although the ability of Afghan units to function without <a href="NATO">NATO</a> control was questioned during the battle. Military engagement over Musa Qala is part of a <a href="Helmand%20province%20campaign">wider conflict</a> between coalition forces and the Taliban in Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related fighting was reported across a larger area, particularly in <a href="Sangin">Sangin</a> district to the south of Musa Qala.

<a href="Musa%20Qala">Musa Qala</a> is a town of around 15,000 to 20,000 people, with another 25,000 in the surrounding area. ISAF forces were first deployed in the town in mid-June 2006, as part of the "platoon house" strategy. This consisted of protecting the district centres of Northern Helmand with small detachments of British ISAF troops, at the request of the provincial governor <a href="Engineer%20Mohammad%20Daoud">Mohammed Daoud</a>. This move met with an unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Taliban and local tribesmen, who used conventional, rather than <a href="Asymmetric%20warfare">asymmetric</a> tactics, to drive the coalition from their positions. The isolated British garrison found itself under siege and constant attack for long periods, and their replacements could only be brought in after a full battle group operation, codenamed Snakebite, broke through Taliban lines in early August.

The fighting ended in October 2006 when, in a controversial move, control was ceded to local tribal elders. The deal was intended to see neither British nor Taliban forces in the town in an effort to reduce conflict and civilian casualties. At the time, a British officer commented: "There is an obvious danger that the Taliban could make the deal and then renege on it." The Taliban did renege on the agreement, quickly over-running the town with 200 to 300 troops in February 2007. The Taliban seizure followed a US airstrike that incensed militants; a Taliban commander's brother and 20 followers were killed in the attack. A confluence of tribal politics, religion, and <a href="Opium%20production%20in%20Afghanistan">money from the opium trade</a> helped ensure the uneasy truce would not hold. At the time, the government claimed they could retake the town within 24 hours, but that plan had been postponed to avoid causing civilian casualties.

Musa Qala was the only significant town held by the Taliban at the time of the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the <a href="Sharia">Sharia</a>. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of <a href="Taliban%20rule%20in%20Afghanistan">previous Taliban rule</a>: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the <a href="burqa">burqa</a>. The town is situated in a major <a href="opium%20poppy">opium poppy</a> growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.

In the lead up to the assault on Musa Qaleh, members of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force provided vital intelligence for the upcoming operation. Coalition military manoeuvres and a build-up of troops and supplies continued for weeks before the assault. On 1 November, British forces started reconnaissance patrols in preparation for the attack. In the middle of that month, the MOD reported that troops from Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF), <a href="3%20Commando%20Brigade">40 Commando</a> <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and the Right Flank Company of the <a href="Scots%20Guards">Scots Guards</a> were patrolling outside the town to confuse the <a href="Taliban%20insurgents">Taliban insurgents</a> and disrupt their supply routes.

In the days before the assault, reconnaissance patrols penetrated as close as a to the Musa Qala town centre. Hundreds of families were reported to have fled from the pending assault, after the coalition dropped leaflets in warning. Furthermore, the coalition secured the defection of a critical tribal leader, Mullah <a href="Abdul%20Salaam%20Alizai">Abdul Salaam</a>, who had been governor of <a href="Uruzgan%20province">Uruzgan province</a> under Taliban rule. A leader of the <a href="Alizai%20tribe">Alizai tribe</a>, Salaam was reported to be in negotiation with the coalition as early as October 2007, causing a rift within the Taliban. His defection was personally sought by Afghan president <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> and he brought as many as one third of the Taliban forces defending Musa Qala to the coalition side. However, it is unclear if they fought on the side of the ISAF or simply stayed out of the fight.

Prior to the battle, two thousand militants were reported to be holding the town. A similar claim of 2,050 "fully armed fighters" was made in late November by Enqiadi, a taliban commander. At the time, Enqiadi seemed confident that the whole of Helmand province would fall to the Taliban in the winter of 2007–08. Subsequent estimates reduced numbers of Taliban fighters, with an ISAF officer suggesting that the maximum strength was closer to two to three hundred.

The main assault on Musa Qala began at 4 pm on 7 December. Several Taliban were reportedly killed in <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">US airstrikes</a> as the attack began. That evening some 600 American soldiers from the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">82nd Airborne Division</a> were airlifted to the north of the town in 19 helicopters. <a href="Boeing%20Chinook%20%28UK%20variants%29">Chinook</a> and <a href="Blackhawk%20helicopter">Blackhawk</a> troop carriers escorted by <a href="AH-64%20Apache">Apache</a> attack helicopters were involved in the assault. During the night the paratroopers broke through Taliban trenches to clear the way for further ground troops and then dug defensive positions. During the attack, an Apache was hit by ground fire and had one engine knocked out but the pilot, CW2 Thomas O. Malone, managed to land safely despite being injured. More than 2,000 British troops of the Helmand Task Force (then under the direction of <a href="52nd%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">52nd Infantry Brigade</a>), including Scots Guards, Brigade Reconnaissance Force formed by 4/73 Special OP Bty & 2 YORKS, <a href="Household%20Cavalry">Household Cavalry</a>, and Royal Marines from 40 Commando, became involved in the operation. British troops set up a cordon around the town to aid the US attack and also began an advance with Afghan troops from the south, west, and east, exchanging gunfire with the Taliban. Whilst the BRF provided the US Paratroopers with fire support from the west. At least on the first day of the battle these advances may have served as a <a href="feint">feint</a> to divert attention from the main US <a href="air%20assault">air assault</a>. <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> and <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>n troops were also involved in the initial assault.

Fighting continued on 8 December. As British and Afghan soldiers continued their ground advance, US air forces repeatedly attacked the Taliban, including numerous anti-aircraft positions surrounding the town. The Taliban defended positions surrounded by minefields, a principal danger to coalition forces. The assault made progress nonetheless, with the <a href="Afghan%20Ministry%20of%20Defense">Afghan Ministry of Defence</a> reporting that day: "In this operation so far, 12 terrorists were killed, one captured and a number of weapons and ammunitions were seized." A British soldier, Sergeant Lee Johnson of the <a href="Yorkshire%20Regiment">2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards)</a>, was killed shortly after 10 am on the eighth, when his vehicle drove over a mine; another soldier was seriously injured in the blast.

Taliban forces took up new positions to defend the town on 9 December. Taliban sources suggested at the time that militants from nearby areas were entering the town to reinforce its defence. Fighting was on-going through the day and bombs planted by insurgents continued to take a toll on ISAF forces: an American soldier, Corporal Tanner J O'Leary of the <a href="508th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">508th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a>, was killed by the detonation of an <a href="improvised%20explosive%20device">improvised explosive device</a>.

By 10 December, news outlets reported that the Taliban insurgents had withdrawn north from the area and that Afghan Army and ISAF forces were in control of the town. The British MOD was more cautious at the time, advising that "steady progress" had been made but that coalition forces remained on the outskirts of Musa Qala. Nevertheless, the Afghan government suggested that the coalition had "completely captured" the town. <a href="NATO">NATO</a> announced the town's capture on the 11th, however at the time the MOD suggested forces were still proceeding cautiously "compound to compound", only officially confirmed the capture of Musa Qala the next day. Afghan troops were called forward for the final push and by midday on the twelfth were reported to be in the town centre, in a gesture symbolising their ability to fight and defeat the Taliban on their own. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Eaton, spokesman for <a href="Task%20Force%20Helmand">Task Force Helmand</a>, described the retaking of the town:

Brigadier <a href="Andrew%20Mackay%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Andrew Mackay</a>, commander of the Helmand Task Force, emphasised that the coalition's plan encouraged the less committed local fighters—the so-called "tier two" Taliban—to break away from the more ideologically driven militants. This strategy may have been successful; Afghan president <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> declared that he had been approached by Taliban members wanting to swap sides after a string of insurgent exactions against civilians. He said: "They hanged a boy of 15 from a ceiling and lit two gas canisters under him." Precise Taliban casualties were not reported although the Afghan Defence Ministry suggested hundreds killed, detained, or captured. The insurgents claimed 17 Afghan army and ISAF killed, and blamed the British for at least 40 civilians deaths, but their claims may not be reliable.

Although fierce in the first days, the battle did not produce the <a href="urban%20warfare">house-to-house combat</a> that had been feared; the Taliban largely retreated without protracted resistance. Poor weather conditions, including fog, may have allowed them to retreat more easily. Taliban spokesmen suggested the retreat was designed to avoid continued airstrikes and civilian casualties within the town. By the time the town centre was reached, fighting proved "unremarkable" and according to one senior US officer: "The urban center of Musa Qala was not significantly opposed, it was not significantly barricaded". The final advance into the town's main bazaar by the Afghan Army was physically led by an Advanced Search Team of the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> followed by <a href="Explosive%20Ordnance%20Disposal">EOD</a> and the main Afghan force who raised their flag for the world's press.

Musa Qala is just one flashpoint in the wider <a href="Helmand%20province%20campaign">Helmand province campaign</a>, a coalition effort to dislodge the Taliban from the volatile province, largely led by British forces. The battle to retake the town sparked conflict in adjoining areas. In November 2007, when reconnaissance patrols began, "vicious" Taliban attacks were launched in <a href="Sangin">Sangin</a> Valley, Helmand province, to the south, including one which saw Royal Marine Commandos endure two days of rocket and <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> fire. Just three days before the main assault, on 4 December, British forces suffered a fatality to the north of the village of Sangin, when Trooper Jack Sadler was killed by a roadside bomb. The week prior to the assault saw a variety of other engagements in Helmand: the British confronted sustained attack near the <a href="Kajaki%20Dam">Kajaki Dam</a>, northeast of Sangin; further west, Estonian, British and American troops were engaged near the town of <a href="Nawzad%2C%20Afghanistan">Nawzad</a> at the center of <a href="Nawzad%20District">Nawzad District</a>. Danish forces under British command were attacked in the town of <a href="Gereshk">Gereshk</a>.

In the days after the main battle was launched, Lieutenant Colonel Eaton confirmed that the Taliban were attempting to create pressure in other areas but that attacks on British bases had been repulsed. One Taliban commander noted: "We have launched attacks in Sangin and in Sarwan Kala (Sarevan Qaleh) ... We have orders to attack the British everywhere." When the principal Taliban retreat from Musa Qala occurred fighting continued elsewhere: on the eleventh and twelfth, retreating Taliban militants attacked a government centre in Sangin. They were repulsed with 50 killed, according to the Afghan Defence Ministry. American, British, and other NATO special forces were specifically deployed to prevent the Taliban from withdrawing north into <a href="Baghran%20District">Baghran District</a>, and east into <a href="Or%C5%ABzg%C4%81n%20Province">Orūzgān Province</a>, their traditional refuge.

British officers expressed satisfaction that Musa Qala had been recaptured without any artillery shells or bombs hitting the town itself. However, they acknowledged that the Taliban had not been definitively defeated and would probably "have another go" in the area. Taliban fighters were believed to have merged back into the local rural population after the defeat, their traditional dress providing simple cover. In the days after the battle, counter-attacks on the town were considered likely and coalition officials suggested sustained defence would be necessary; British forces plan to reinforce Musa Qala but have emphasised that future defence of the village will be largely Afghan controlled. The optimistic picture of Afghan capability presented by ISAF command has been challenged. A reporter on the ground, writing for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", notes that the Afghan forces "could barely function without NATO's protection and NATO had to cajole them to move forward".

British Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> was in Helmand at the time of the assault, visiting troops at <a href="Camp%20Bastion">Camp Bastion</a>. He suggested success at Musa Qala would provide a step toward Afghan peace and promised continued reconstruction relief. Coalition and Afghan government plans include the construction of a local <a href="mosque">mosque</a>, the rebuilding of a district centre, police buildings, schools, and the repair of the electricity infrastructure. The governor of Helmand, <a href="Assadullah%20Wafa">Assadullah Wafa</a>, said a delegation would visit Musa Qala to distribute 5,000 tons of aid to returning civilians in the immediate aftermath of the battle. On 26 December, engineers from 69 <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a> Field Squadron, 36 Engineer Regiment moved into Musa Qala and started rebuilding the district centre. Their task includes the construction of a perimeter fence made of <a href="Hesco%20bastion">Hesco bastion</a>s, and <a href="Sangar%20%28fortification%29">sangars</a> (watchtowers) made of sandbags.

Various Taliban supplies were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches as they moved further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started to return to the area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i and <a href="Arab">Arab</a> <a href="jihadi">jihadi</a>s. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.

The strategic purpose of controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan and to serve as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.

Civilian return to the town was slow, with shops still shuttered on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the driver was shot dead.

Coalition and Afghan authorities continued their efforts to win over Taliban sympathizers. However a "miscommunication between authorities" created some tension. In late December, two western diplomats were expelled from Afghanistan. Governor Assadullah Wafa accused them of holding secret talks with the Taliban and proposing bribes to them; the secret talks were denied as a misunderstanding by a UN spokesperson. In January 2008, Mullah Abdul Salaam was appointed governor of Musa Qala district by the Afghan government, a gesture that was intended to encourage other Taliban commanders to change sides.

News reports mentioned numerous Taliban commanders having participated in the Battle of Musa Qala, many reported killed or captured:

Valston Hancock

<a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir Valston Eldridge (Val) Hancock, (31 May 1907 – 29 September 1998) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1961 to 1965. A graduate of the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, Hancock transferred to the RAAF in 1929 and qualified as a pilot. His administrative training at Duntroon saw him primarily occupy staff posts, including Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters from 1931 to 1935, and Director of Works and Buildings from 1937 to 1939. During the early years of World War II, he commanded No. 1 Bombing and Gunnery School, and held senior planning and administrative positions. He eventually saw combat in the <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">Aitape–Wewak campaign</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> during 1945. Flying <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light bombers, he led first <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a>, and later <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>. His actions earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>.

After the war, Hancock became the inaugural commandant of <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a>. His subsequent positions included <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1951 to 1953, Air Member for Personnel from 1953 to 1955, and <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="No.%20224%20Group%20RAF">No. 224 Group RAF</a> in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, responsible for all <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> air forces in the region, from 1957 to 1959. Appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1958, he served as AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">RAAF Operational Command</a> from 1959 to 1961, before being promoted to air marshal and commencing his term as Chief of the Air Staff. He was <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighted</a> in 1962. In his role as the Air Force's senior officer, Hancock initiated redevelopment of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Learmonth">RAAF Base Learmonth</a> in north <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, as part of a chain of <a href="RAAF%20Bare%20Bases">forward airfields</a> for the defence of the continent. He also evaluated potential replacements for the RAAF's <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bomber, selecting the American "TFX" (later the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111</a>) as the most suitable for Australia's needs, though he did not recommend its immediate purchase due to its early stage of development. After his retirement from the military in May 1965, Hancock co-founded the Australia Defence Association. He died in 1998, aged 91.

Hancock was born on 31 May 1907 in <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, Western Australia, and educated at <a href="Hale%20School">Hale School</a> in <a href="Wembley%20Downs%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wembley Downs</a>. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate <a href="Lang%20Hancock">Lang Hancock</a>. Val Hancock entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1925 and graduated as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, and it was only when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1 February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, later that year.

Hancock's initial postings after qualifying as a pilot were to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 1</a> and <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">3 Squadrons</a>. It was, however, common practice for Duntroon graduates to be given staff positions in the Air Force because of their training in administration, and Hancock was no exception. He spent most of the 1930s in a succession of posts at RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. From 1931 to 1935, he served as Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence. He married Joan Butler on 26 May 1932; the couple had two sons and a daughter. By 1935, Hancock had been promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> and appointed Staff Officer to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. In 1937 he was posted to Britain to attend the <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. Like other <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> air forces, the RAAF maintained close technological and educational ties with the Royal Air Force, and Hancock was one of 30 Australian officers to pass through Andover before the outbreak of World War II. Returning to Australia in 1938, he was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and became Director of Works and Buildings, commonly known as "Works and Bricks", at RAAF Headquarters.

In March 1940, Hancock's Directorate of Works and Buildings was transferred from the office of the Chief of the Air Staff to the newly formed Organisation and Equipment Branch under Air Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>. Considered a key part of the Air Force's expansion during the early part of World War II, "Works and Bricks" quickly absorbed all staff with civil engineering and building experience in the RAAF active reserve. As Director, Hancock was responsible for surveying and developing a <a href="Evans%20Head%20Memorial%20Aerodrome">military aerodrome at Evans Head</a>, near the Queensland and New South Wales border, which became home to No. 1 Bombing and Gunnery School (No. 1 BAGS). Promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, he held command of No. 1 BAGS, operating <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a> single-engined bombers, from August 1940 until November 1941. He was promoted to acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in April 1941. Appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) on 1 January 1942, Hancock became Assistant Director of Plans at Allied Air Forces Headquarters, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, that April. He was made Director of Plans at the Air Force's main operational formation, <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, when it was established in September. In 1943–44, he served as Staff Officer Administration for <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area Command</a>, which maintained two bomber squadrons for <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> and two fighter squadrons to guard against possible attack on the mainland by Japanese <a href="Aircraft%20carrier">carrier-borne</a> aircraft.
Hancock finally achieved a combat command in January 1945, when he took charge of <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light bombers during the <a href="Aitape-Wewak%20campaign">Aitape-Wewak campaign</a> in New Guinea. That month, the unit attacked Japanese positions at <a href="Maprik%20District">Maprik</a>, below the <a href="Prince%20Alexander%20Mountains">Prince Alexander Ranges</a>, and Cape Moem, near <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>. On 1 April, Hancock took over <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a>, which came under overall control of RAAF Northern Command and nominally comprised <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 7</a>, <a href="No.%208%20Squadron%20RAAF">8</a> and 100 Beaufort Squadrons, as well as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> of <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a> fighter-bombers from <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron</a>. It was soon augmented by two more Beaufort units, <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 6</a> and <a href="No.%2015%20Squadron%20RAAF">15 Squadrons</a>. Providing <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> to Australian ground troops in the lead-up to the final assault on Wewak, the wing flew over 1,400 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s and dropped more than 1,200 tons of bombs in May alone. By mid-year, Hancock's forces were acutely short of fuel and ordnance, to the extent that his squadrons took to arming their Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. In July, enough supplies arrived to enable the wing to continue operating at normal strength. No. 71 Wing was active to the very last day of the Pacific War, flying its final combat mission involving 30 Beauforts only hours before news of victory arrived on 15 August 1945. Hancock's "distinguished flying on operations in Northern Command" earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>; the award was published in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 22 February 1946.

Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders considered suitable for future senior roles, Hancock retained his rank of group captain following the end of hostilities. As Director of Personnel Services during 1946, he was involved in restructuring the Air Force into a dramatically smaller peacetime service. He recalled this time as a "twilight period" when "no-one wanted to know about us" and many good people were let go due to the government's parsimonious retention policies. In 1947, Hancock was promoted to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> and appointed inaugural commandant of the newly formed <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a>, Point Cook, the Air Force's equivalent of <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Duntroon</a> and the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a>. He also drafted the institution's charter. Departing in late 1949, he spent the following year in Britain, where he attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>. On his return to Australia in 1951, he was promoted to acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and made <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>. He was raised to a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the 1953 <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">New Years Honours</a>. In October that year, Hancock took over from Air Vice Marshal <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a> as Air Member for Personnel (AMP). As AMP, he occupied a seat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. Completing his term in January 1955, Hancock was posted to Britain as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. He spent much of the latter half of 1955 and early 1956 laid low by a stomach ailment that was initially diagnosed as <a href="Amoebiasis">amoebic dysentery</a> but was later thought to be <a href="Brucellosis">Malta fever</a> or <a href="malaria">malaria</a>.

In March 1957, Hancock was one of three candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> and <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a>, touted as possible successors to Air Marshal <a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Sir John McCauley</a> as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Scherger gained selection, and Hancock was posted in June to <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="No.%20224%20Group%20RAF">No. 224 Group RAF</a>, responsible for all Commonwealth air forces in the region. Though fastidious in appearance and a strict <a href="teetotaller">teetotaller</a>, he was known for his enthusiasm in meeting staff and as "an indefatigable participant in mess functions and games". He also made a point of getting out to units in the field, taking every opportunity to fly himself around his command. For his "distinguished service in Malaya", Hancock was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) on 9 December 1958. He returned to Australia in July 1959 to serve as AOC Operational Command (now <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>). When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete, Hancock and Walters were once more put forward to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Air</a> as potential replacements. His "professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities" being deemed more appropriate for the role, Hancock was promoted to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and took over as CAS in May 1961. In June, he met with his opposite numbers in the <a href="Reg%20Pollard%20%28general%29">Army</a> and <a href="Henry%20Burrell">Navy</a> at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 2 June.
As CAS, Hancock worked to enhance the RAAF's deterrent capability in the Pacific region, particularly in light of heightened tensions with <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> during its period of <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"Konfrontasi"</a> with <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. In June 1963, Hancock undertook a mission to Britain, France and the United States to consider potential replacements for the <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bomber as Australia's prime aerial strike platform. After investigating the US <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">"TFX"</a>, <a href="North%20American%20A-5%20Vigilante">North American A-5 Vigilante</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II</a>, the British <a href="BAC%20TSR-2">BAC TSR-2</a>, and the French <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20IV">Dassault Mirage IV</a>, Hancock decided that the swing-wing TFX, forerunner of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the aircraft best suited for this role. However, as the TFX had not yet flown, he recommended purchase of the already operational Vigilante to counteract a perceived imminent threat from Indonesia. In the event, the Federal Government did not go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra, and Hancock's original choice of the TFX was taken up as a long-term solution, leading to Australia's agreement in October to purchase the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">F-111C</a>. The same month, as "Konfrontasi" continued to simmer, Hancock approved simplification to the rules of engagement for Australian <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> fighters based at <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">RAAF Butterworth</a> to engage and destroy Indonesian aircraft violating Malay air space. The following month he urged using RAAF Canberras from Butterworth to make pre-emptive strikes against Indonesian air bases, in retaliation for incursions into West Malaysia, but Britain, which had initially requested Australia's involvement, held back on action.

Once the F-111 had been ordered, Hancock sought a suitable forward airfield from which they could operate. In this, he continued a policy initiated by his predecessor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, of developing a chain of so-called "<a href="RAAF%20Bare%20Bases">bare bases</a>" in Northern Australia. Hancock recommended redeveloping <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Learmonth">RAAF Base Learmonth</a> in the northern part of Western Australia, due to its proximity to Indonesia. Flying out of this airfield, the F-111s could destroy "vital centres in <a href="Java">Java</a>"; just as importantly for deterrence purposes, Hancock contended, enhancing the base's capability would send a clear message to Indonesia's hierarchy. Though the project was delayed, in part due to thawing in relations between Australia and Indonesia, Learmonth's upgrade was completed in 1973, the same year that the F-111 finally entered RAAF service. The latter part of Hancock's tour as CAS coincided with the beginning of large-scale <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Australian involvement in the Vietnam War</a>. By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a> cargo planes, to the region at the request of the <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>ese government. Under Hancock, the Caribou had itself only been reluctantly ordered by the Air Force following intense pressure from the Army and the Federal government for an <a href="STOL">STOL</a> transport. Concerned at the potential drain on the RAAF's resources, Hancock tried to resist calls for commitments to Vietnam. His negative views were in contrast to the hawkish attitudes of his deputy, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Colin%20Hannah">Colin Hannah</a>, and Air Chief Marshal Scherger, now <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> and Australia's senior soldier. In April 1965, as part of American operations in Indochina, <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> strike aircraft took up residence at <a href="Ubon%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ubon Air Force Base</a>, Thailand, which since 1962 had been home to <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron</a> Sabres and run by the RAAF under <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organisation">SEATO</a> arrangements. Hancock proposed that Australia continue to command the facility and provide local air defence, though this effectively made the Sabres a support unit in the war effort and therefore potential targets of <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>ese attack; in the event, none occurred.

Hancock retired from the Air Force in May 1965 after completing his term as CAS, which the government had extended for twelve months beyond its original three years. Having followed two fellow Royal Military College graduates—McCauley and Scherger—in the role, he was succeeded by another former Duntroon cadet, <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>. Hancock's name was put forward as a successor to Scherger when the latter's term as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee completed in May 1966, but Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Sir Robert Menzies</a> preferred General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">Sir John Wilton</a> for the position. Later the same year, Hancock took over as Commissioner-General for Australia at <a href="Expo%2067">Expo 67</a> in <a href="Montreal%2C%20Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>, Canada, following the sudden death of the previous appointee, Vice Admiral <a href="Hastings%20Harrington">Sir Hastings Harrington</a>. In 1975, prompted in part by the <a href="fall%20of%20Saigon">fall of Saigon</a> in April that year, Hancock co-founded the Australia Defence Association as an independent <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a> for defence matters, and chaired its Western Australian chapter. He was also active in the <a href="Royal%20Commonwealth%20Society">Royal Commonwealth Society</a>, and published an autobiography, "Challenge", in 1990. Hancock continued to fly in retirement, joining his cousin Lang, also a pilot, in promoting the <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a> mining district. Val Hancock died in Perth on 29 September 1998, and was survived by his wife and three children. He is commemorated by Sir Valston Hancock Drive at Evans Head.

Thopha saccata

Thopha saccata, commonly known as the double drummer, is the largest Australian species of <a href="cicada">cicada</a> and reputedly the loudest insect in the world. Documented by the Danish zoologist <a href="Johan%20Christian%20Fabricius">Johan Christian Fabricius</a> in 1803, it was the first described and named cicada native to Australia. Its common name comes from the large dark red-brown sac-like pockets that the adult male has on each side of its abdomen—the "double drums"—that are used to amplify the sound it produces.

Broad-headed compared with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern across the back of its <a href="Thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a>, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's <a href="tymbal">tymbal</a>s and sac-like covers. Found in <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>s. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as <a href="Nymph%20%28biology%29">nymphs</a> from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.

Danish naturalist <a href="Johan%20Christian%20Fabricius">Johan Christian Fabricius</a> described the double drummer as "Tettigonia saccata" in 1803, the first description of an Australian cicada. The <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23Use%20of%20type%20specimens">type locality</a> was inexplicably and incorrectly recorded as China. It was placed in the new <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Thopha">Thopha</a>" by French entomologists <a href="Charles%20Jean-Baptiste%20Amyot">Charles Jean-Baptiste Amyot</a> and <a href="Jean%20Guillaume%20Audinet-Serville">Jean Guillaume Audinet-Serville</a> in their 1843 work "Histoire naturelle des insectes Hemipteres" ("Natural History of Hemiptera Insects"). The <a href="genus">generic</a> name is derived from "thoph" (), meaning "<a href="drum">drum</a>". They maintained it as native to China. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "saccus", meaning "sac" or "bag", and more specifically "moneybag".

In 1838, <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20%C3%89douard%20Gu%C3%A9rin-M%C3%A9neville">Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville</a> pointed out that the double drummer is native to Australia and not China. <a href="John%20Obadiah%20Westwood">John Obadiah Westwood</a> designated it the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus in 1843, and it is also the type species for the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Thophini">Thophini</a>. The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> is derived from the male cicada's sac-like tymbal covers ("drums") on either side of its abdomen.

The adult double drummer is the largest Australian species of cicada, the male and female averaging long respectively. The <a href="Thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a> is in diameter, its sides distended when compared with the thorax of other Australian cicadas. The <a href="Insect%20wing">forewings</a> are long. The largest collected specimen has a wingspan of , while the average is . The average mass is . The sexes have similar markings, but males have large dark red-brown sac-like structures on each side of their abdomens. These cover the <a href="tymbal">tymbal</a>s—specialised structures composed of vertical ribs and a tymbal plate, which is buckled to produce the cicada's song. The head is much broader than that of other cicadas, and is broader than the <a href="prothorax">pronotum</a> behind it. The head, <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> and <a href="Clypeus%20%28arthropod%20anatomy%29">postclypeus</a> are black, with a narrow broken pale brown transverse band across the <a href="Vertex%20%28anatomy%29">vertex</a> just behind the <a href="Simple%20eye%20in%20invertebrates%23Dorsal%20ocelli">ocelli</a>. The eyes are black in young adult cicadas upon emerging, but turn brown with black <a href="pseudopupil">pseudopupil</a>s at the posterior edge of the eye. The ocelli are deep red. The <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> is in length—very long compared with other Australian cicada species. The thorax is brown, becoming paler in older individuals. The pronotum is rusty brown with black anterior borders, while the <a href="Mesothorax">mesonotum</a> is a little paler with prominent black markings, with paired cone-shaped spots with bases towards the front on either side of a median stripe; lateral to these spots are a pair of markings resembling a "7" on the right hand side of the mesonotum and its reverse on the left. The abdomen is black between the tymbal covers and red-brown and black more posteriorly. The underparts of the double drummer are red-brown and black, and covered in fine silvery velvety hairs. The female's <a href="ovipositor">ovipositor</a> is very long, measuring . The <a href="Insect%20wing">wings</a> are vitreous (transparent) with light brown veins. They have an array of <a href="Cuticle%23Invertebrate%20zoology">cuticular</a> nanostructures—conical protuberances with a spacing and height of about 200 <a href="Nanometre">nm</a>, tipped with a spherical cap with a <a href="Radius%20of%20curvature%20%28applications%29">radius of curvature</a> of around 25–45 nm—on the transparent panes of their wings. These act as anti-wetting and anti-reflective surfaces. The legs are dark brown and have grey velvety hairs.

There is little variation in colour over its range, though occasional females are darker overall than average, with markings less prominent or absent. The double drummer is larger and darker overall than the northern double drummer ("<a href="Thopha%20sessiliba">T. sessiliba</a>"); the latter has a white band on the abdomen, while the former has black markings on the leading edge (<a href="Comstock%E2%80%93Needham%20system">costa</a>) of the forewing extending past the <a href="Glossary%20of%20entomology%20terms%23base">basal cell</a>.

Male cicadas make a noise to attract females, which has been described as "the sound of summer". The song of the double drummer is extremely loud—reportedly the loudest sound of any insect—and can reach an earsplitting volume in excess of 120 <a href="decibel">dB</a> if there are large numbers of double drummers at close range. Monotonous and dronelike, the song is said to resemble high-pitched bagpipes. The sound of the buckling of the tymbal plate then resonates in an adjacent hollow chamber in the abdomen, as well as in the exterior air-filled sacs, which act as <a href="Helmholtz%20resonance">Helmholtz resonators</a>.

Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, and often ends abruptly. The song has been described as "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2 <a href="Hertz">kHz</a> and 6.0–7.5 kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a <a href="staccato">staccato</a> sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5 kHz. The frequency of the song is a high <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> of the pulse repetition frequency, which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.
Male double drummers also emit a distress call—a sharp fragmented irregular noise—upon being seized by a predator.

The narrow spindle-shaped eggs are laid in a series of slits cut by the mother's ovipositor in branches or twigs, usually of eucalypts. On average about twelve eggs are laid in each slit, for a total of several hundred. These cuts can cause significant damage to the bark of tender trees. The eggs all hatch around 70 days later—usually within a day or two of one another—but take longer in cold or dry conditions. The larvae then fall to the ground and burrow into the soil. Though the timing of the double drummer's life cycle is unknown, <a href="Nymph%20%28biology%29">nymphs</a> of cicadas in general then spend from four to six years underground. Unusual for Australian cicadas, double drummers emerge during the daytime. Emerging "en masse" generally, nymphs are covered in mud. This mud remains on their <a href="exuvia">exuvia</a>e, which emerging cicadas leave at the bases or in burnt out hollows of eucalypts. Within a forest, successive broods may emerge in different locations each year. The cicada's body and wings desiccate and harden once free of the exuvia.

The adult lifespan of the double drummer is about four or five weeks. During this time, they mate and reproduce, and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it out through specialised mouthparts. Female cicadas die after laying their eggs.

The double drummer has a <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a>, found from northern tropical Queensland, near Shiptons Flat and <a href="Cooktown%2C%20Queensland">Cooktown</a> south to <a href="Ingham%2C%20Queensland">Ingham</a> and <a href="Sarina%2C%20Queensland">Sarina</a>, and then from <a href="Gympie">Gympie</a> in southeastern Queensland to <a href="Moruya%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moruya</a> in southern New South Wales. It is found in areas of higher elevation in the northern segment of its range, as the climate there is similar to that in southeast Queensland. <a href="Walter%20Wilson%20Froggatt">Walter Wilson Froggatt</a> and <a href="Robert%20John%20Tillyard">Robert John Tillyard</a> erroneously included South Australia in its distribution.

Adults are present from November to early March, prolific in some years and absent in others. They are found in dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest, preferring to alight and feed on large eucalypts with diameters over and sparse foliage concentrated at a height between , particularly rough-barked species, apples ("<a href="Angophora">Angophora</a>") and "<a href="Tristania%20%28plant%29">Tristania</a>". Associated trees include the grey box ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20moluccana">Eucalyptus moluccana</a>"), snappy gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20racemosa">E. racemosa</a>") and narrow-leaved apple ("<a href="Angophora%20bakeri">Angophora bakeri</a>") in a study at three sites in western Sydney. At <a href="Hawks%20Nest%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Hawks Nest</a> in coastal swampy sclerophyll woodland, adults were observed mainly on swamp mahogany ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20robusta">Eucalyptus robusta</a>") and sometimes blackbutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pilularis">E. pilularis</a>"), as well as "<a href="Allocasuarina%20littoralis">Allocasuarina littoralis</a>" and introduced pine ("<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>"). Nymphs feed primarily on the roots of eucalypts.

The double drummer has not adapted well to city life; distribution of the species in cities is limited to natural stands of large trees.

In hotter weather, double drummers perch on the upper branches of trees, while on overcast or rainy days, they may be found lower down on trunks near the ground. Double drummers on tree trunks are skittish, and can fly off "en masse" if disturbed. Relative to other Australian cicadas they have excellent perception, fly at a moderate cruising speed of , with a similarly moderate maximum speed of , and are exceptionally adept at landing. The double drummer has been known to fly out to sea, effectively on a one-way trip as their bodies have later been found washed up on beaches. A swarm of double drummers were reported off the coast of <a href="Sussex%20Inlet">Sussex Inlet</a> in January 1979, in and around the boat of a local fisherman.

As the adult cicadas emerge in the daytime, large numbers are consumed by birds. "Thopha" cicadas have also been found in the stomachs of foxes. The double drummer is one of the large cicada species preyed on by the <a href="Exeirus">cicada killer wasp</a> ("Exeirus lateritius"), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of . They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive "catacomb", to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.

Schoolchildren climb trees to collect live cicadas and keep them as pets in shoeboxes. However, they cannot easily be kept for longer than a day or two, given that they need flowing sap for food. Live adults brought into classrooms by their captors would startle the class with their piercing sound. Poems dedicated to the double drummer appeared in the "<a href="Catholic%20Press">Catholic Press</a>" in 1933 and 1936, describing bird predation and its life cycle to children.

Carucage

Carucage was a medieval English <a href="Land%20value%20tax">land tax</a> introduced by King <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> in 1194, based on the size—variously calculated—of the estate owned by the taxpayer. It was a replacement for the <a href="danegeld">danegeld</a>, last imposed in 1162, which had become difficult to collect because of an increasing number of exemptions. Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by taxes on income and <a href="personal%20property">personal property</a>.

The taxable value of an estate was initially assessed from the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Survey</a>, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or on the number of plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England%23Captivity%20and%20return">ransom for Richard's release</a> in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by <a href="Leopold%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold V, Duke of Austria</a>; it covered the tax John had to pay <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a> in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.

Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue in order to supplement and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.

In medieval England there was no clear separation between the king's household and the treasury. The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, <a href="Feudalism">feudal rights</a> (such as <a href="feudal%20aid">feudal aid</a>s or <a href="feudal%20relief">feudal relief</a>s, which derived from the king's position as a <a href="Feudal%20lord">feudal overlord</a>), taxation, and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that about 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts. By 1194 revenue from the land came to about 37% of the total, about 25% came from feudal rights, taxation raised about 15%, and income from judicial sources about 11%.

English taxation after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066 was based on the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not <a href="serfdom">serfs</a> or slaves. The geld was based on the number of <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a> of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I's</a> reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.

Most information about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, but there is no detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the "<a href="Dialogue%20Concerning%20the%20Exchequer">Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer</a>", written in about 1180. Government records such as the <a href="Pipe%20Roll">Pipe Roll</a>s, the <a href="Memoranda%20Roll">Memoranda Roll</a>s, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.

Under Henry's son, King Richard I, a new land tax was collected, the first since 1162. It was organised by <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, the <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a> of England who was in charge of governing England while the king was gone. Like the geld, the carucage was based on the amount of land owned, thus targeting free men rather than serfs, who owned no land and were therefore exempt. First collected in 1194, and the first land tax collected in England since the geld, carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or <a href="carucate">carucate</a>s (a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox plough-team in a year, which was normally considered equivalent to a hide). The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey, a survey of land holdings in England that was completed by 1087.

Collected again in 1198, and usually called the "great carucage", it was initially assessed at a rate of 2 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s per carucate (estimated at or ), but later an additional 3 shillings per carucate was imposed. This 1198 collection was to provide the king with money for his military campaigns in France, and raised about £1,000. A number of fines were subsequently imposed on taxpayers for evading payment, suggesting that the 1198 tax was not very successful.

According to the late 12th century chronicler <a href="Roger%20of%20Howden">Roger of Howden</a>, the main source for information on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each <a href="Hundred%20%28administrative%20division%29">hundred</a> (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a>s or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23 counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.

The lower clergy and bishops resisted Richard's attempt to impose the 1198 carucage on their estates. In response, Richard withdrew their access to his royal courts forcing them to buy it back for a sum greater than the carucage would have collected.

King John, Richard's brother and successor, collected the carucage only once, in 1200. John set the amount to be collected from each carucate at three shillings. Revenues from this taxation do not appear in the 1200 Pipe Roll, although the designation in official records of <a href="William%20of%20Wrotham">William of Wrotham</a> and his assistants as "receptores carucagii"—"receivers of the carucage"—suggest that the money raised was paid into a special commission in the Exchequer. Whether lands were assessed by the system used in 1198 is unknown. The contemporary chronicler <a href="Ralph%20of%20Coggeshall">Ralph of Coggeshall</a> noted that an "order went throughout England by the justices or the king" to collect the tax, which may imply that the King appointed justices to collect the tax instead of using the earlier system. The carucage was raised in order to pay John's feudal relief— the payment to an overlord on inheriting lands—for his 1199 inheritance of lands in France. The relief had been set by King Philip II of France, John's overlord, at 20,000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a>. Estimates of the amount raised by this carucage—about £3,000—are based on later revenues raised during the following reign.

The <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> monasteries in the north of England resisted the tax, claiming that they were immune to taxation. John put pressure on them, as he was in the north when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, by then Chancellor. Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £1,000, but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer. In October, the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through Walter's intercession, the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax.

John's son, King Henry III, assessed the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was to secure the consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied. The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3 shillings per carucate. The assessment of the amount of lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct. Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the tax was sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer. The 1217 carucage was only paid by <a href="Laity">laymen</a>; the <a href="clergy">clergy</a> made a donation in lieu of being taxed. The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Louis of France</a>, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.

The 1220 carucage, which was imposed on both laymen and clergy, was collected by a special commission, and was paid not into the Exchequer, but to the <a href="Templar%20Order">Templar Order</a> church in London, the <a href="Temple%20Church">New Temple</a>. The Templars through their international organization functioned as bankers in and between countries. The three men appointed to the commission—William de Halliwell, a friar, William FitzBenedict, a London resident, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer clerk—were responsible for accounting for the money received, which amounted to £3,000. The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short; the orders for the assessments to be made were issued in August, but required the tax to be collected by <a href="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a> in late September. The 1220 tax attempted to allow for variation in land values, exempting barren land from taxation. The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler than the 1217 levy, as plough-teams were counted to determine the land size rather than requiring oaths from taxpayers. This tax gathered around £5,500. There was some difficulty in its collection however, as some counties did not pay, and a number of barons refused to pay, at least at first. The 1220 carucage was levied to pay for the defence of Henry's lands in <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>, southern France.

The 1224 carucage was a tax levied only on the clergy, and the revenues from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It is likely that the clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the money raised was paid into the <a href="Wardrobe%20%28government%29">Wardrobe</a>, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.

The last carucage was imposed in 1224, after which most of the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on moveable or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.

Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue to supplement existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained <a href="scutage">scutage</a>, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.

Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)

"Partners in Crime" is the first episode of the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%204%29">fourth series</a> of the British <a href="science%20fiction%20television">science fiction television</a> series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". It was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on 5 April 2008. The episode reintroduced actor and comedian <a href="Catherine%20Tate">Catherine Tate</a> as the <a href="Temporary%20work">temp</a> <a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna Noble</a>, who had previously appeared in the 2006 Christmas Special "<a href="The%20Runaway%20Bride%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Runaway Bride</a>". In the episode, Donna and the alien <a href="Time%20travel%20in%20fiction">time traveller</a> the <a href="Tenth%20Doctor">Tenth Doctor</a> (<a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>) meet while separately investigating Adipose Industries, a company that has created a revolutionary <a href="Anti-obesity%20medication">diet pill</a>. Together, they attempt to stop the death of thousands of people in London after the head of the company, the alien <a href="Miss%20Foster">Miss Foster</a> (<a href="Sarah%20Lancashire">Sarah Lancashire</a>), creates the <a href="List%20of%20Doctor%20Who%20monsters%20and%20aliens%23Adipose">Adipose</a>, short white aliens made from human <a href="body%20fat">body fat</a>.

The episode's alien creatures, the Adipose, were created using the software "<a href="MASSIVE%20%28software%29">MASSIVE</a>", commonly used for crowd sequences in fantasy and science fiction films.

"Partners in Crime" features the return of three recurring characters: <a href="Jacqueline%20King">Jacqueline King</a> reprises her role as <a href="Sylvia%20Noble">Sylvia Noble</a> from "The Runaway Bride"; <a href="Bernard%20Cribbins">Bernard Cribbins</a> reprises his role as <a href="Wilfred%20Mott">Wilfred Mott</a> from "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>", to replace the character of Geoff Noble after actor <a href="Howard%20Attfield">Howard Attfield</a> died; and <a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a> briefly reprises her role as <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a> for the first time since the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%202%29">second series</a>' finale "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>" (2006), in a scene that was not included in preview showings.

The episode received many positive reviews. Most critics liked the special effects used to create the Adipose. Critics also praised Tate's subdued acting in comparison to "The Runaway Bride"; Donna was changed from a "shouting <a href="wikt%3Afishwife">fishwife</a>" to a more emotional person when she became a full-time companion. Critics' opinions were split over the episode's plot: opinion on executive producer <a href="Russell%20T%20Davies">Russell T Davies</a>' writing ranged from "pure pleasure" to "the back of a <a href="cigarette%20pack">fag packet</a>".

<a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna Noble</a> has become disenchanted with her normal life for two years since meeting the Doctor in "<a href="The%20Runaway%20Bride%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Runaway Bride</a>". She finds herself regretting her decision to decline the Doctor's invitation to travel in the <a href="TARDIS">TARDIS</a> after her father Geoff died. She has started investigating conspiracy theories in the hope that she will find him again. She confides her regrets to her grandfather <a href="Wilfred%20Mott">Wilfred Mott</a>, who met the Doctor before in "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>".

The Doctor and Donna, neither one aware of the other's involvement, both investigate Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special <a href="diet%20pill">diet pill</a> to the people of London. They find that the pill's slogan, "The Fat Just Walks Away", is literal. The pills use latent body fat to <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenetically</a> create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his <a href="sonic%20screwdriver">sonic screwdriver</a> to create a diversion and escape.

Miss Foster accelerates her plans, knowing that the Doctor will attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the Adipose begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total emergency parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the pill, and the remainder of the young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion <a href="Martha%20Jones">Martha Jones</a> made him more human.

At the end of the episode, Donna accepts the Doctor's original offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a>, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred.

"Partners in Crime" features several actors returning to the series. Catherine Tate was offered the opportunity to return as Donna Noble during lunch with executive producer <a href="Julie%20Gardner">Julie Gardner</a>. Tate, who expected Gardner would ask about appearing in a <a href="Biographical%20film">biopic</a>, later admitted it was "the furthest thing from [her] mind". Tate's return was controversial amongst "Doctor Who" fans; the criticism she received was compared to <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> after he was cast as <a href="James%20Bond%20%28character%29">James Bond</a>. Howard Attfield, who appeared as Donna's father Geoff in "The Runaway Bride", filmed several scenes for this episode, but died before his scenes for the remainder of the season were completed. The producers retired his character out of respect, and dedicated him in the closing credits for the episode. Producer <a href="Phil%20Collinson">Phil Collinson</a> suggested transferring his traits to the unrelated character Stan Mott from "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>", and rewriting his role as Donna's grandfather. Executive producers <a href="Russell%20T%20Davies">Russell T Davies</a> and Gardner liked the idea and recalled Bernard Cribbins to the role to re-film Attfield's scenes, with the character renamed as Wilfred—a name Davies favoured for Donna's grandfather—in time for the credits of "Voyage of the Damned" to be changed.

Davies took a different approach while writing the episode. David Tennant and Sarah Lancashire noted the character of Miss Foster had good intentions but was morally ambiguous. The premise of the Adipose pill was equally ambiguous with rare side-effects, but was a "win-win situation" for anyone involved. Davies based the character of Miss Foster on "<a href="Supernanny">Supernanny</a>" star <a href="Jo%20Frost">Jo Frost</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> philanthropist and politician <a href="Eva%20Per%C3%B3n">Eva Perón</a>, and Lancashire compared her character to <a href="Mary%20Poppins%20%28character%29">Mary Poppins</a>. The Adipose are a different style to regular "Doctor Who" villains; antagonists such as Lazarus in "<a href="The%20Lazarus%20Experiment">The Lazarus Experiment</a>" or the werewolf in "<a href="Tooth%20and%20Claw%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Tooth and Claw</a>" were singular monsters designed to scare the audience; the Adipose were written as "cute" to provide a "bizarre [and] surreal" experience.

Davies made some changes to Donna's character. The character was "rounded ... out from being a shouting <a href="wikt%3Afishwife">fishwife</a> to someone who's quite vulnerable and emotional". Donna was written to provide a "caustic" and "grown-up" attitude towards the Doctor, in opposition to Rose and Martha, who fell in love with him. Tate considered Donna to be more equal to the Doctor because her character did not romanticise him, allowing her to question his morality more easily.

In this production, the script requires Catherine Tate, as Donna Noble, to reintroduce herself to the Doctor in mime. The stage directions by writer Russell T Davies are as follows.

Tate says Davies had suggested that she might come up with something on the day. She improvised her <a href="mime">mime</a> during filming.

The episode was in the fourth production block in the season, and was filmed in October 2007. The out-of-sequence filming allowed producers to use props to "seed" later episodes; ATMOS, a plot device in the episodes "<a href="The%20Sontaran%20Stratagem">The Sontaran Stratagem</a>" and "<a href="The%20Poison%20Sky">The Poison Sky</a>", is referred to by a sticker on a taxi's windscreen. As the episode mostly takes place at night, many scenes were filmed in the early morning.

The scene where Donna and the Doctor investigate Adipose was difficult to film. The scene took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. The scene was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre on the outskirts of <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a> on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.

Exterior shots of Adipose Industries were filmed at the British Gas building (<a href="Helmont%20House">Helmont House</a>) in <a href="Cardiff%20city%20centre">Cardiff's city centre</a>. For health and safety reasons, Tennant was prohibited from performing his own stunts in the window cleaning platform. His only shot that required stunts was when he catches Miss Foster's sonic pen, a shot that took several takes to perfect.

The Adipose were inspired by a stuffed toy Davies owned. The name comes from the scientific name for body fat, <a href="adipose%20tissue">adipose tissue</a>. Davies' brief outlined a "cute" child-friendly creature shaped like a block of <a href="lard">lard</a>, similar to the <a href="Pillsbury%20Doughboy">Pillsbury Doughboy</a>. Further consultation with <a href="post-production">post-production</a> team <a href="The%20Mill%20%28post-production%29">The Mill</a> resulted in the ears and the singular fang each Adipose has. <a href="Stephen%20Regelous">Stephen Regelous</a>, who won an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for his software "<a href="Massive%20%28software%29">Massive</a>", flew to London to supervise the creation of the crowd special effects. Regelous, a "Doctor Who" fan, was enthusiastic about helping The Mill with special effects, stating that "When I first found out that the Mill was working on "Doctor Who", I was quietly hoping that Massive might be used to create hordes of Daleks or Cybermen and with series 4, I jumped at the opportunity to be involved." The Mill created two types of Adipose: extras with artificial intelligence and independent movement, and "hero" Adipose, which were hand-animated.

The episode was broadcast on 5 April 2008 at 18:20, the earliest timeslot since the show's revival in 2005. Davies criticised the BBC's scheduling department and claimed the show could lose 1.5 million viewers. The show retained a similar time of broadcast for a further four episodes, before returning to around 19:00. from "<a href="The%20Doctor%27s%20Daughter">The Doctor's Daughter</a>" onwards.

The preview version of the episode supplied to the press and aired at the press launch omitted the scene that features Rose; before broadcast, only the production team, Tate, and Tennant had seen the scene. The scene contains Rose's departure <a href="motif%20%28music%29">theme</a>, "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29%23Music">Doomsday</a>". Tennant commented "on the night of transmission ... the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" won't have told you it's coming, it'll come as a genuine [...] prickle up the spine".

Overnight figures estimated the show was watched by 8.4 million viewers, with a peak of 8.7 million, 39.4% of the television audience. The consolidated rating was 9.1 million viewers. "Doctor Who" was therefore the most watched show on 5 April, although the <a href="Grand%20National">Grand National</a> had a higher peak with 10.1 million viewers. The episode's <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Appreciation Index</a> was 88 (considered "Excellent"), the highest for any television show aired on 5 April.

The episode received many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", called the episode an "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said "last night's episode struck me as being as close to 50 minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote">Wile E. Coyote</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a>, which "[was] a nice little touch in an episode ... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". Sam Wollaston of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that Tate was "not right for this role" and "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion was an attempt to trade on the popularity of her own series and "broaden the appeal of [Dr Who] still further". He also found the music "a bit oppressive" but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of "<a href="Metro%20%28Associated%20Metro%20Limited%29">Metro</a>" gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason of the quality of the show. Closing, he said "it split [his] sides".

Jon Wise of "<a href="The%20People">The People</a>" said "Doctor Who is a super-galactic way of spending a Saturday night indoors", and appreciated that Donna was not romantically interested in the Doctor, unlike Martha or Rose. Ben Rawson-Jones gave the episode a wholly positive review, summarising it as containing "pure fantastic family fun, delivering a winning blend of action, comedy, poignancy and one unexpected shock cameo".

The episode received several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", lamented that Davies had "forgotten that Doctor Who's main task is to send children <a href="behind%20the%20sofa">scuttling behind sofas</a> while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of <a href="SyFy%20Portal">SyFy Portal</a> summarised it as "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the "<a href="Sunday%20Mirror">Sunday Mirror</a>" criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All we got in the way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." <a href="Ian%20Hyland">Ian Hyland</a> of "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>" criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to "the back of a <a href="cigarette%20pack">fag packet</a>". He also criticised Tennant for appearing "jaded" and Tate for "still shouting".

Kosta Pećanac

Konstantin "Kosta" Milovanović Pećanac (; 1879–1944) was a <a href="Serbs">Serbian</a> <a href="Chetnik%23World%20War%20I%20and%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Chetnik</a> commander ("<a href="vojvoda">vojvoda</a>") during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Pećanac fought on the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbian</a> side in both Balkan Wars and World War I, joining the forces of <a href="Kosta%20Vojinovi%C4%87">Kosta Vojinović</a> during the <a href="Toplica%20uprising">Toplica uprising</a> of 1917. Between the wars he was an important leader of Chetnik veteran associations, and was known for his strong hostility to the <a href="Yugoslav%20Communist%20Party">Yugoslav Communist Party</a>, which made him popular in conservative circles. As president of the Chetnik Association during the 1930s, he transformed it into an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with over half a million members. During World War II, Pećanac <a href="collaborationism">collaborated</a> with both the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> military administration and their <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Salvation">puppet government</a> in the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German occupied territory of Serbia</a>.

Just before the <a href="Axis%20invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">Axis invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, the Yugoslav government provided Pećanac with funds and arms to raise guerrilla units in southern Serbia, <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. He formed a detachment of about 300 men, mostly in the <a href="Toplica%20%28river%29">Toplica river</a> valley in southern Serbia, which avoided destruction during the invasion. In the first three months after the surrender, Pećanac gathered more troops from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. However, <a href="Pe%C4%87anac%20Chetniks">his Chetniks</a> fought only <a href="Albanian%20people">Albanian</a> groups in the region, and did not engage the Germans. Following the <a href="Uprising%20in%20Serbia%20%281941%29">uprising</a> in the occupied territory in early July 1941, Pećanac quickly resolved to abandon resistance against the occupiers, and by the end of August had concluded agreements with the German occupation forces and the puppet government of <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a> to collaborate with them and fight the <a href="communist">communist</a>-led <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a>. In July 1942, rival Chetnik leader <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a> arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor, and his continuing collaboration with the Germans ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.

The Germans rapidly realised that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers had grown to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had no confidence in them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.

Kosta Milovanović was born in a village near <a href="De%C3%A7an">Dečani</a> in 1879, although some sources mistakenly identify the year as 1871. His father Milovan was a guardian of the <a href="Visoki%20De%C4%8Dani">Visoki Dečani</a> monastery. Pećanac's father and his brother Milosav fought in the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20of%201877%E2%80%931878">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878</a>. In 1883, both of his parents were killed in an attack by Albanians on the monastery. After that point, Pećanac was looked after by his uncle in the village of Đurakovac near <a href="Pe%C4%87">Peć</a> for an unknown amount of time.

He arrived in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a> in 1892 at the age of 14 and worked as a <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a>. When he was 21, he was called up for army service and served in the engineer corps, becoming a reserve officer. He later worked with the border gendarmerie near <a href="Vranje">Vranje</a> as a <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. Pećanac was discharged at some point for reasons unknown and later joined the Chetniks. While serving with them he was given the nickname "Pećanac", derived from the name of the town in which he grew up.

In 1895, war broke out in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Pećanac joined the <a href="Serbian%20Chetnik%20Organization">Serbian Chetnik Organization</a> in 1903, and fought against the <a href="Ottoman%20army">Ottoman army</a> in several significant battles including that of Šuplja Stena (near <a href="P%C4%8Dinja%20District">Pčinja</a>) and <a href="Fight%20on%20%C4%8Celopek">Čelopek</a> (near <a href="Staro%20Nagori%C4%8Dane">Staro Nagoričane</a>). The <a href="deacon">deacon</a> of the <a href="Vladika">Vladika</a> of <a href="%C5%BDi%C4%8Da">Žiča</a> and commander (, војвода) <a href="Jovan%20Grkovi%C4%87-Gapon">Jovan Grković-Gapon</a> suggested awarding Pećanac the title of "<a href="Voivode%23Serbia">vojvoda</a>"; at a Christmas-day meeting in 1904, Pećanac received the title at the age of 25. In the period between 1905 and 1907, he led several major battles against the Ottoman army in the <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a> region. In 1908, Pećanac married Sofia Milosavljević from the town of <a href="Aleksinac">Aleksinac</a>. He went on to father four children with her. In 1910, as the struggles in Macedonia intensified, he left his children and pregnant wife, and returned to the battlefield.

In the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>, fought from October 1912 to May 1913, Pećanac was mobilised in the Serbian Third Army, holding the rank of <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> in the <a href="Morava%20Division">Morava Division</a>. He took part in the defeat of the Albanians in <a href="Merdare">Merdare</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kumanovo">Battle of Kumanovo</a> and the liberation of <a href="Metohija">Metohija</a>. During the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a>, fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913, Pećanac is believed to have been stationed at the front at Kitka on <a href="Osogovo">Osogovo</a> Mountain along the <a href="Zletovska">Zletovska</a> and <a href="Bregalnica">Bregalnica</a> rivers. There, his division took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bregalnica">Battle of Bregalnica</a> with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgarians</a>. After the Bulgarian attacks failed, they sent parliamentarians to seek a truce, but the Serbian side refused and the fighting continued. After his division had endured six days of heavy fighting, the Bulgarians were defeated at <a href="Grljani">Grljani</a> near <a href="Vinica%20Municipality%2C%20Macedonia">Vinica</a>.

Following the disastrous end to the <a href="Serbian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Serbian campaign</a> in late 1915, Pećanac escaped to <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> along with the retreating Serbian army and government, and ultimately joined the <a href="Salonika%20front">Salonika front</a>. In 1915, Pećanac had received various medals for his "merit in fighting" including three gold medals for bravery, one for military virtue, and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Star%20of%20Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e">Order of the Star of Karađorđe</a> (4th Class) for his service in World War I and possibly also for his prior military accomplishments.

In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to <a href="Mehane">Mehane</a> (south-west of <a href="Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a> in the <a href="Toplica%20District">Toplica</a> region) to prepare a guerrilla uprising in support of a planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as "<a href="komitadji">comitadji</a>". Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on <a href="Kopaonik">Mount Kopaonik</a>. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January – February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarians</a> committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.

In April 1917, Pećanac re-emerged with his guerrillas, attacking a railway station, destroying a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian village on the border. Pećanac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September–October 1917 Pećanac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the <a href="Imperial%20and%20Royal%20Military%20Administration%20in%20Serbia">Austro-Hungarian occupied zone</a>, where he remained in hiding until mid-1918. During his period in hiding, he met with the Kosovar Albanian leader <a href="Azem%20Galica">Azem Galica</a> to discuss joint actions against the occupation forces.

Pećanac was the most prominent figure in the Chetnik movement during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. During the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes%20Constitutional%20Assembly%20election%2C%201920">1920 Constitutional Assembly elections</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Nikola%20Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikola Pašić</a> sent Pećanac to the <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a> with orders to intimidate the local Muslim population in the hope of keeping the turnout low. In the same year, attempts by the Yugoslav government to disarm and conscript Kosovo Albanians were met by revolts. Pećanac was sent to Kosovo to form detachments made up of local Serbs to fight the rebels. This resulted in rebel attacks on Serb villages.

Pećanac had a leading role in the <a href="Association%20against%20Bulgarian%20Bandits">Association against Bulgarian Bandits</a>, an organisation that arbitrarily terrorised Bulgarians in the <a href="%C5%A0tip">Štip</a> region. He also served as a commander with the <a href="Organization%20of%20Yugoslav%20Nationalists">Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists</a> (ORJUNA). Pećanac was present as a member of parliament at the assassination of <a href="Croatian%20Peasant%20Party">Croatian Peasant Party</a> (HSS) leader <a href="Stjepan%20Radi%C4%87">Stjepan Radić</a> and HSS deputies Pavle Radić and <a href="%C4%90uro%20Basari%C4%8Dek">Đuro Basariček</a> on 20 June 1928. Prior to the shooting, he was accused by HSS deputy <a href="Ivan%20Pernar%20%28politician%2C%20born%201889%29">Ivan Pernar</a> of being responsible for a massacre of 200 Muslims in 1921.

Pećanac became the president of the Chetnik Association in 1932. By opening membership of the Chetnik Association to new younger members that had not served in World War I, he grew the organisation during the 1930s from a nationalist veterans' association focused on protecting veterans' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500,000 members throughout the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>. During this period, Pećanac formed close ties with the far-right <a href="Yugoslav%20Radical%20Union">Yugoslav Radical Union</a> government of <a href="Milan%20Stojadinovi%C4%87">Milan Stojadinović</a>. Pećanac was known for his hostility to the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a>, which made him popular with conservatives, especially those in Stojadinović's party.

Shortly before the Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Pećanac was requested by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Yugoslavia%29">Yugoslav Ministry of the Army and Navy</a> to prepare for guerrilla operations and guard the southern area of Serbia, Macedonia, and Kosovo from pro-Bulgarians and pro-Albanians rebels. He was given money and weapons, and managed to arm several hundred men in the <a href="Toplica%20%28river%29">Toplica River</a> valley in southern Serbia. Pećanac's force remained intact after the German occupation of Serbia and supplemented its strength from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. Pećanac's detachments fought against Albanian bands in the early summer of 1941. At this time and for a considerable time after, only detachments under Pećanac were identified by the term "Chetnik". With the rise of the communist <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a>, Pećanac gave up any interest in resistance and by late August reached agreements with both the Serbian <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a> and the German authorities to carry out attacks against the Partisans.

While he was concluding arrangements with the Germans, on 18 August 1941 Pećanac received a letter from <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a> requesting an agreement be reached where Pećanac would control the Chetniks south of the <a href="West%20Morava">Western Morava River</a> while Mihailović would control the Chetniks in all other areas. Pećanac declined his request and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> position and recommended Mihailović's detachments disband and join his detachments. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.

On 27 August, Pećanac issued an open "Proclamation to the Dear People", in which he portrayed himself as a defender and protector of Serbs and called "on detachments that have been formed without his approval" to come together under his command. He demanded that individuals hiding in the forests immediately return to their homes and that acts of sabotage against the occupiers cease or the perpetrators would face death.

In September 1941, some of Pećanac's subordinates broke ranks to join with the Partisans in fighting the Germans and their Serbian auxiliaries. In the Kopaonik region, a previously loyal subordinate of Pećanac began attacking local gendarmerie stations and clashing with armed bands of Albanian Muslims. By the end of October, the Germans decided to stop arming the "unreliable" elements within Pećanac's Chetniks, and attached the remainder to their other Serbian auxiliary forces.

On 7 October 1941, Pećanac sent a request to <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a>, the head of the <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Salvation">Serbian puppet government</a>, for stronger organisation, supplies, arms, salary funds, and more. Over time, his requests were fulfilled and a German <a href="liaison%20officer">liaison officer</a> was appointed at Pećanac's headquarters to help coordinate actions. According to German data, on 17 January 1942 72 Chetnik officers and 7,963 men were being provided for by the Serbian <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a> Command. This fell short of the maximum authorized size of 8,745 men and included two or three thousand of Mihailović's Chetniks who were legalized in November 1941. In the same month, Pećanac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern <a href="Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, but was refused over Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the Sandžak.

In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, "General der Artillerie" (General) <a href="Paul%20Bader">Paul Bader</a>, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, which were put under the command of the local German division or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.

The Germans soon found that Pećanac's units were inefficient, unreliable, and of little military use. Pećanac's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries, such as the <a href="Serbian%20State%20Guard">Serbian State Guard</a> and <a href="Serbian%20Volunteer%20Corps%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Serbian Volunteer Command</a>, as well as with Mihailović's Chetniks. The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942, and all but one were dissolved by the end of 1942. The last detachment was dissolved in March 1943. Pećanac's followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces, German labour units, and prisoner-of-war camps. Many deserted to join Mihailović. Nothing is known of Pećanac's activities in the months that followed except that he was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government.

Accounts of Pećanac's capture and death vary. According to one account, Pećanac, four of his leaders and 40 of their followers were captured by forces loyal to Mihailović in February 1944. All were killed within days except Pećanac, who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944. Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailović.

2005 ACC Championship Game

The 2005 Dr. Pepper <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> was the inaugural contest of the game. It was a regular-season ending <a href="college%20football">American college football</a> contest at <a href="Jacksonville%20Municipal%20Stadium">Jacksonville Municipal Stadium</a> in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> between the <a href="2005%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> and the <a href="2005%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team">Florida State Seminoles</a>. The game decided the winner of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> football championship. Florida State University (FSU) defeated Virginia Tech 27–22 in a game characterized by penalties, defense, and a fourth-quarter comeback attempt by Virginia Tech. The game was the final contest of <a href="2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">the regular season</a> for the two teams, as <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a>s are not considered part of the regular season. In addition, the contest marked the inaugural championship game for the recently expanded conference.

Virginia Tech entered <a href="2005%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">the 2005 season</a> having won the 2004 ACC Championship, the last to be awarded without playing a championship game at the end of the season. Tech won its first eight games and appeared to be on course to have an untroubled run to the ACC Championship Game. But against the fifth-ranked <a href="2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami Hurricanes</a>, Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, losing 27–7 on November 5. Because each team had one ACC loss (Miami had previously lost to Florida State) and the Hurricanes had the tie-breaking head-to-head win, Miami had the lead in the Coastal Division. But Miami later lost a second ACC game to the <a href="2005%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a>, and the Hurricanes were knocked out of contention for the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Divisions">Coastal Division</a> title in favor of the Hokies, who lost only to Miami.

Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game by fighting through an <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Divisions">Atlantic Division</a> schedule that included several nationally ranked teams. After defeating ninth-ranked Miami in their opening contest, the Seminoles won their next four games before losing at <a href="2005%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia</a> in a close match. Additional losses to <a href="2005%20NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football%20team">North Carolina State</a> and <a href="2005%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a> at the end of the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the <a href="2000%20Sugar%20Bowl">2000 National Championship Game</a>, and the rematch served as a point of public interest.

The first two quarters of the game were characterized by defense and penalties that stifled both teams' offenses. In the second half, Florida State took advantage of a <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> to begin a third-quarter surge. Although Virginia Tech made a late-game comeback, Florida State <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">ran out the clock</a> and secured a 27–22 victory. Florida State's win earned it the 2005 ACC Championship and a bid to the <a href="2006%20Orange%20Bowl">2006 Orange Bowl</a> against <a href="2005%20Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football%20team">Penn State</a>. Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the <a href="2006%20Gator%20Bowl">2006 Gator Bowl</a> against <a href="2005%20Louisville%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Louisville</a>. Following that game, Tech <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> was released from the team due to repeated violations of team rules and several legal infractions.

The <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a> traditionally matches the winner of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Football">Coastal and Atlantic Divisions</a> of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no championship game existed. The idea for a championship game originated with the league's 2004 expansion, which added former <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East</a> members <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20Football">Virginia Tech</a>, and (in 2005) <a href="Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football">Boston College</a>. A request to the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12 teams, and so the league's first championship game had to wait until after Boston College's addition, which had been delayed by a year. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules. Before the start of the 2005 season, both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre-season favorites to play in the championship game in an annual poll conducted by members of the media who cover the ACC.

The Hokies began the 2005 regular season ranked eighth in the country, and played their first game at ACC opponent <a href="2005%20NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football%20team">North Carolina State</a>. It was a close-fought game, but <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> threw a game-winning touchdown early in the fourth quarter and the defense slowed a late NC State rally as Virginia Tech earned a 20–16 win. Following the close call against NC State, the Hokies <a href="Blowout%20%28sports%29">blew out</a> their next several opponents. Virginia Tech defeated <a href="2005%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football%20team">Duke</a> and <a href="2005%20Ohio%20Bobcats%20football%20team">Ohio</a> by scores of 45–0 each. The Virginia Tech defense held Duke's offense to just 35 <a href="total%20offense">total yards</a>, an NCAA record. Following those victories, Tech hosted 15th-ranked <a href="2005%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a>, beating the Yellow Jackets by a score of 51–7. Tech's defensive success in those games was typical of the season as Virginia Tech won the first eight games of its season.

In their ninth game, however, third-ranked Virginia Tech suffered its first loss. On a Thursday night game at home, the Hokies lost 27–7 to the fifth-ranked <a href="2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami Hurricanes</a>. Normally, a loss to the division-rival Hurricanes would have knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, as Miami had the tie-breaking head-to-head victory and was expected to win the remainder of its games. But because Virginia Tech won the rest of its games and the Hurricanes lost two ACC contests, (Virginia Tech's only ACC loss was to Miami) the Hokies won the Coastal Division championship and qualified for the championship game over Miami.

The Seminoles, like Virginia Tech, were picked as pre-season favorites to win their division. Florida State opened its 2005 season against traditional rival <a href="2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a>, ranked ninth in the country. In a defensive struggle, Florida State managed to upset the favored Hurricanes, 10–7. Following the victory, Florida State went on a four-game winning streak, defeating <a href="2005%20Syracuse%20Orange%20football%20team">Syracuse</a>, <a href="2005%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College</a>, <a href="2005%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football%20team">Wake Forest</a>, and <a href="2005%20The%20Citadel%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">The Citadel</a> en route to a 5–0 record.

In the Seminoles' sixth game of the season, they traveled to <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> to face the <a href="2005%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia Cavaliers</a>. In a hard-fought game, the Seminoles lost, 26–21, earning their first loss of the season. After winning their next two games, Florida State lost to NC State, <a href="2005%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a>, and 19th-ranked <a href="2005%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team">Florida</a>, the first time they had three consecutive losses since 1983. Florida State ended the regular season with a conference record of 5–3, but because one of those losses had been against a Coastal Division opponent, Florida State finished with the best Atlantic Division record and was named that division's representative to the ACC Championship Game.

Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was predicted to be the key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610 <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing yards</a> in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach <a href="Bobby%20Bowden">Bobby Bowden</a> had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a> was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.

In addition, the game was a rematch of the <a href="2000%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">2000 BCS National Championship Game</a>. In that game, held in <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, Florida State defeated Virginia Tech 46–29 despite the performance of Hokie <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>, who would later be selected as the first overall pick in the <a href="2001%20NFL%20Draft">2001 NFL Draft</a>. Vick's brother, Marcus, would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback for the 2005 ACC Championship Game.

The Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback Marcus Vick, brother of former Tech all-star Michael Vick. Coming off a season-long suspension in 2004, Vick <a href="forward%20pass">threw</a> for 1,855 yards, 14 <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s and nine <a href="interception">interception</a>s in the 2005 season leading up to the ACC Championship. Vick also ran for four touchdowns during the season and earned first-team All-ACC honors. Receiving Vick's passes were a number of <a href="wide%20receivers">wide receivers</a> and <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a>s. Tight end <a href="Jeff%20King%20%28American%20football%29">Jeff King</a>, a second-team All-ACC selection, had 20 receptions for 230 yards and five touchdowns for the season before the ACC Championship. Wide receivers <a href="Eddie%20Royal">Eddie Royal</a> and <a href="David%20Clowney">David Clowney</a> also had statistically significant seasons heading into the conference championship. Royal had 21 <a href="Reception%20%28American%20football%29">catches</a> for 271 yards and two touchdowns during the regular season, while Clowney had 28 catches for 515 yards and three touchdowns.

Virginia Tech's rushing offense was led by several different <a href="running%20back">running back</a>s: <a href="Mike%20Imoh">Mike Imoh</a>, Branden Ore, and <a href="Cedric%20Humes">Cedric Humes</a>. In 2005, Hokie running back Cedric Humes had accumulated a career-high 134 yards and two touchdowns against <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football">North Carolina</a> in the Hokies' final regular-season game. Backup running back Branden Ore ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts, the second time in as many games that Humes and Ore ran for 100 yards or more in the same game. The Hokies ran 31 times in the second half and threw only two passes. A similar running game was predicted for the ACC Championship Game. Imoh, meanwhile, was limited by an ankle injury suffered during the course of the season. Heading into the conference championship game, he had <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushed</a> for 415 yards and three touchdowns.

The day before the game, Florida State <a href="Center%20%28American%20football%29">center</a> David Castillo was named to the <a href="ESPN%20the%20Magazine">ESPN the Magazine</a> Academic All-America Second Team, which recognizes college football players who have achieved academic success. Writers and staffers at the magazine vote on a list of players, which is separated into "teams" based on position and performance. Castillo, who was a key component of the Seminoles' offensive line, was also a finalist for the <a href="Draddy%20Trophy">Draddy Trophy</a>, informally known as the "academic <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman</a>".

FSU quarterback <a href="Drew%20Weatherford">Drew Weatherford</a> recorded a statistically impressive year and was the top freshman quarterback in the nation in terms of passing yardage and passing touchdowns. Wide receivers Willie Reid, Greg Carr and Chris Davis were the primary beneficiaries of Weatherford's passing offense during the 2005 season. Carr, a freshman, caught 27 passes for 593 yards and a conference-leading nine touchdowns. Davis, a junior, caught more passes and recorded more receiving yards during the 2005 season than he had in both his previous seasons combined. Reid, the lone senior starting in the Florida State corps of wide receivers, played in a variety of positions on offense and held the Seminoles' team record for most <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> yardage.

The Seminoles' rushing offense was led by starting running backs <a href="Leon%20Washington">Leon Washington</a> and <a href="Lorenzo%20Booker">Lorenzo Booker</a>. Booker led the team in rushing yardage, rushing attempts, rushing touchdowns, and average yards per game. Washington was the tenth-ranked rusher in Florida State history in terms of rushing yardage.

Heading into the ACC Championship game, the Virginia Tech defense was ranked first in the nation for total defense and scoring defense. In pass defense, the Hokies were second in the nation, allowing an average of just 88.38 yards a game. ACC rival Miami was first, allowing just 84.57 yards per game on average.

On the field, the Tech defense was captained by <a href="safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Justin Hamilton, who recorded 26 tackles and three <a href="interception">interception</a>s during the 2005 season. On the <a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a>, Tech's most significant defensive players were <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a>s Chris Ellis and <a href="Darryl%20Tapp">Darryl Tapp</a>. Tapp, an All-ACC selection, recorded 41 tackles (including nine <a href="quarterback%20sack">sack</a>s), three forced <a href="fumble">fumble</a>s, and a blocked <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>. Ellis recorded defensive MVP honors for the Hokies' first-ranked defense. At <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a>, the Hokies started <a href="Vince%20Hall">Vince Hall</a> and <a href="Xavier%20Adibi">Xavier Adibi</a>. Hall, a second-team All-ACC performer, led the team in tackles and returned a fumble and an interception for a touchdown during the regular season. Adibi recorded 61 tackles during the season, having recovered from a torn muscle suffered during the <a href="2004%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">2004 season</a>.

On defense, the Seminoles were led on the defensive line by <a href="nose%20guard">nose guard</a> Brodrick Bunkley, who ranked among Florida State's historical leaders in <a href="Tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackles for loss</a>. Also on the defensive line was defensive end Kamerion Wimbley, who was among the ACC's leaders in recorded <a href="quarterback%20sack">sack</a>s. At linebacker, the Seminoles had A.J. Nicholson, who was a semifinalist for the <a href="Butkus%20Award">Butkus Award</a>, traditionally given to the best linebacker in college football.

By the end of the 2005 season, the Seminoles recorded five blocked kicks, 12 interceptions, and more than 1,000 tackles. The Seminoles finished the season ranked 12th in rushing defense and 14th in total defense.

The 2005 ACC Championship Game kicked off in Jacksonville, Florida at 8:11 p.m. on December 3, 2005. The game was televised on <a href="American%20Broadcast%20Company">ABC</a> in the United States, and earned a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 5.1, higher than that of either the <a href="Big%2012%20Football%20Championship%20Game">Big 12 Championship Game</a> or the <a href="SEC%20Championship%20Game">Southeastern Conference Championship Game</a>. <a href="Brent%20Musburger">Brent Musburger</a>, <a href="Jack%20Arute">Jack Arute</a>, and <a href="Gary%20Danielson">Gary Danielson</a> were the broadcasters for the game. At kickoff, the weather was mostly cloudy with an <a href="air%20temperature">air temperature</a> of  degrees. Approximately 72,429 fans were present at the game, but more than 75,000 tickets had been sold. Virginia Tech won the pre-game coin toss, but elected to defer its choice to the second half, forcing Florida State to have the ball on offense to begin the game.

Florida State received the ball to begin the game, and <a href="kick%20return">returned</a> the opening <a href="kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23R">red zone</a>. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard <a href="false%20start">false start</a> penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach <a href="Bobby%20Bowden">Bobby Bowden</a> sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 3–0 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.

Virginia Tech's first possession of the game began at its 15-yard line after the Florida State kickoff. Hokie quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> completed his first pass of the game, a nine-yard toss to Eddie Royal, and the Hokies picked up a first down on the next play. From there, however, things began to go downhill for the Virginia Tech offense. Vick was <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> on the next play, running back Cedric Humes was tackled for a five-yard loss, and the Hokies committed a five-yard false start penalty. The miscues prevented Virginia Tech from gaining another first down, and the Hokies were forced to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a> the ball away. Florida State recovered the kick at the 50-yard line and began its second offensive possession of the game. Although Weatherford completed his first pass of the drive, both subsequent passes fell <a href="incomplete%20pass">incomplete</a>. The Seminoles punted the ball back to Virginia Tech, and the kick rolled into the end zone for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>.

The Florida State touchback allowed Vick to start at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second possession of the game. The possession began no better than the first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard <a href="Penalty%20%28American%20football%29%23List%20of%20penalties">holding penalty</a> on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35 yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech to the edge of the Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 3–3 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.

After receiving the post-field goal kickoff, the Florida State offense began another drive. After an incomplete pass and a short rush, Weatherford completed a 12-yard pass for a first down as time expired in the quarter. After 15 minutes of play, the score was tied 3–3, but Drew Weatherford had begun driving Florida State offense down the field.

Having earned a first down with the final play of the first quarter, Drew Weatherford and the Florida State offense ran into difficulty as the second quarter began. An incomplete pass and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another incomplete pass, and Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed to capitalize on the defensive stop. Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt.

Following the punt, the two teams continued to trade possessions throughout the quarter. Defense dominated, and what few big plays occurred were either neutralized by penalties or stopped by incomplete passes or rushes for no gain. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs once. Florida State punted the ball three times and had the ball when time ran out in the quarter. Neither team managed to score, and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent's territory. At halftime, the score remained tied, 3–3.

Because Florida State had received the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49 yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown of the game and the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 10–3 lead.
After the kickoff, the Hokie offense continued the lethargy that had characterized its play in the first half, as Mike Imoh was stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays before the Hokies were called for a five-yard <a href="American%20football%23Penalties">illegal procedure</a> penalty. On the next play, Florida State capitalized on the momentum it had gained with Reid's punt-return touchdown as defender Pat Watkins intercepted Marcus Vick's pass, returning it to the FSU 44-yard line. Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense, with the game's momentum firmly in their favor, wasted no time expanding their lead. Weatherford completed a 6-yard pass, then a 21-yard one, and was aided by a 15-yard <a href="football%20helmet">facemask</a> penalty against Virginia Tech. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, the third play of the drive was a 14-yard touchdown rush by Leon Washington. The speed of the drive, after a nearly scoreless first half, frustrated the Virginia Tech defense, which committed a 15-yard personal foul after the touchdown. The scoring drive had taken just three plays and 54 seconds, and gave Florida State a 17–3 lead with 10:23 remaining in the quarter.

Their frustration clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared no better on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, and the only positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24 yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing to pick up the first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.

Though hampered by the need to work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28 yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks to the bad kick, Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of the situation. On the first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10 yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of three yards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 20–3 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.

Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense took the field badly needing to cut down Florida State's lead in order to allow enough time for a fourth-quarter comeback. This was not to be, however, as on the sixth play of the drive, wide receiver David Clowney fumbled the ball after catching a three-yard pass from Marcus Vick. The ball was successfully recovered by Florida State's Broderick Bunkley, thus giving Florida State another excellent chance to score from deep inside Virginia Tech territory. On the second play after the fumble, quarterback Drew Weatherford connected on a 22-yard strike to Greg Carr to drive inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. A five-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech only added to the Hokies' defensive problems, and two plays later, Weatherford capped the drive with a six-yard touchdown pass to Chris Davis, expanding the Florida State lead to 27–3 with just 18 seconds remaining in the quarter.

At the end of the third quarter, any hope of victory was seemingly out of reach for Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after the kickoff resulted in a first down before time ran out, but at the end of the third quarter, Florida State still had a 27–3 lead.

Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball and with a first down, but trailing by 24 points and virtually out of the game. The first two plays of the fourth quarter were similar to what the Tech offense had shown all game: an incomplete pass and a rush for no yards. On the third play, however, Florida State was penalized 15 yards for having too many players on the field, and Virginia Tech was awarded an automatic first down. The penalty allowed the Hokie offense to continue its drive, and Marcus Vick scrambled for 16 yards on the next play, then threw a 28-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan, who broke free for a touchdown. The score was Virginia Tech's first touchdown of the game, and came with 13:03 remaining in the game. Following the touchdown, the Hokies attempted a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>, but Vick's pass fell short and the conversion attempt failed. The score cut the Florida State lead to 27–9, but this was still a large margin for the amount of time remaining in the game.

Florida State received the post-score kickoff merely needing to <a href="Running%20out%20the%20clock">run down the clock</a> to secure its lead and the win. Two complete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only a minute and a half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a <a href="pass%20interference">pass interference</a> penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15 automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled four yards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11 points. The drive had taken just 55 seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.

Florida State began work at its 30-yard line, again needing to just run down the clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, throwing a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two and a half minutes had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.

By this point in the game, Florida State was fully committed to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its <a href="Time-out%20%28sport%29">timeout</a>s to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. Fortunately for the Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was tacked onto the end of the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 27–22.

In a situation with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and hoped for a defensive stop to give the offense a chance for a game-winning drive. With less than two minutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a>. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a <a href="jump%20ball">jump ball</a> situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nine yards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10 yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.

Having recovered the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts and no way to stop the clock, Florida State was able to run out the remaining time in the game and secure a 27–22 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the <a href="2006%20Orange%20Bowl">2006 Orange Bowl</a>.

Thanks to his performance in leading Florida State to the win, FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford was named the game's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a>. Weatherford finished the game having completed 21 of his 35 passes for 225 yards and one touchdown. Weatherford would eventually finish the season with 3,180 passing yards, the most ever recorded by a freshman quarterback in the ACC. On the opposite side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick finished the game 26 for 52 with 335 yards, one interception, and one touchdown. Although Vick was slightly better statistically than Weatherford and the Hokies were more statistically successful on offense thanks to Vick, the Most Valuable Player award is not usually given to a player on the losing team.

Virginia Tech turned the ball over twice—once on a <a href="fumble">fumble</a> and once on an <a href="interception">interception</a>. The two turnovers resulted in two touchdowns for Florida State, and the resulting 14 points were greater than Florida State's margin of victory. The Seminoles did not turn the ball over during the game. Both teams were highly penalized during the game. Virginia Tech finished with 17 penalties for 143 yards, while Florida State was penalized 12 times for 114 yards. The penalties affected each team's ability to convert <a href="Down%20%28American%20football%29">third downs</a>, as Virginia Tech was only able to convert 9 of 20 third-down attempts, while Florida State was successful on just 3 of its 13 attempts. Despite trailing for much of the game and running a pass-heavy offense, Virginia Tech dominated the game's time of possession, controlling the ball for over 35 of the game's 60 minutes.

Florida State's 27–22 victory over Virginia Tech secured it the 2005 ACC Championship and a bid to the Orange Bowl. The victory also had ripple effects for <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> bids across the Atlantic Coast Conference and lasting repercussions during the football season that followed the game.

Florida State (8–4) earned a BCS berth despite a record inferior to the other seven BCS teams. Regardless of that fact, the Seminoles' matchup with Penn State (10–1) in the <a href="2006%20Orange%20Bowl">2006 Orange Bowl</a>, where college football's two winningest coaches, Penn State's 78-year-old <a href="Joe%20Paterno">Joe Paterno</a> and Florida State's 76-year-old <a href="Bobby%20Bowden">Bobby Bowden</a>, squared off.

Virginia Tech accepted a bid to the 2006 Gator Bowl, which was also played in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>, albeit a month later than the ACC Championship Game. The Gator Bowl Committee selected the Hokies over <a href="2005%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a> due to Virginia Tech's reputation for having a large fan base that traveled well. Virginia Tech's selection bumped Miami to the <a href="Peach%20Bowl">2005 Peach Bowl</a>, while the <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football">Virginia Cavaliers</a> were selected for the <a href="Music%20City%20Bowl">Music City Bowl</a> and the <a href="Clemson%20Tigers%20football">Clemson Tigers</a> earned a bid to the <a href="Champs%20Sports%20Bowl">Champs Sports Bowl</a>.

In the off-season following the ACC Championship Game and Florida State's selection by the Orange Bowl, the Orange Bowl committee announced it would be entering into an exclusive contract with the ACC to grant the winner of the ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough in the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> standings to play in the <a href="BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">BCS National Championship Game</a>.

Following the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a> stormed off the field, refusing to talk to reporters. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in the game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006 Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed that he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Elvis%20Dumervil">Elvis Dumervil</a>. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology had been made. In the wake of the incident, Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.

On January 6, 2006, just a few days after that game, Virginia Tech officials dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 <a href="traffic%20stop">traffic stop</a> in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick had hidden the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal.

2005 Sugar Bowl

The 2005 Sugar Bowl was a postseason <a href="American%20football">American</a> <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> between the <a href="2004%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> and the <a href="2004%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team">Auburn Tigers</a> at the <a href="Louisiana%20Superdome">Louisiana Superdome</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, on January 3, 2005. It was the 71st edition of the annual <a href="Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> football contest. Virginia Tech represented the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) in the contest, while Auburn represented the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC). In a defensive struggle, Auburn earned a 16–13 victory despite a late-game rally by Virginia Tech.

Virginia Tech was selected as a participant in the game after winning the <a href="List%20of%20Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%20football%20champions">ACC football championship</a> during the team's first year in the conference. Tech, which finished 10–2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl, defeated 16th-ranked Virginia and ninth-ranked Miami en route to the game. Auburn finished the regular season undefeated at 12–0. The Tigers defeated fourth-ranked <a href="LSU%20Tigers%20football">LSU</a> and fifth-ranked <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football">Georgia</a> during the course of the season, and were one of five teams to finish the regular season undefeated; the others were <a href="2004%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team">Southern California</a>, <a href="2004%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="2004%20Utah%20Utes%20football%20team">Utah</a>, and <a href="2004%20Boise%20State%20Broncos%20football%20team">Boise State</a>, with USC and Oklahoma being selected to play in the <a href="BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">Bowl Championship Series national championship game</a>. Auburn, by virtue of its lower ranking in the <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series%23Rankings">BCS poll</a>, was left out of the national championship and was selected to play in the Sugar Bowl.

Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans in the weeks leading up to the game. Much was made of that and the success of Auburn <a href="running%20back">running back</a>s <a href="Carnell%20Williams">Carnell Williams</a> and <a href="Ronnie%20Brown">Ronnie Brown</a>, each of whom was considered among the best at his position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Bryan%20Randall">Bryan Randall</a> had a record-breaking season. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the <a href="2000%20Sugar%20Bowl">2000 Sugar Bowl</a> also was mentioned in the run-up to the game.

The 2005 Sugar Bowl <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> on January 3, 2005, at 8:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>. Early in the first quarter, the Tigers took a 3–0 lead. Following an <a href="interception">interception</a> by the Auburn defense, the Tigers were extended their lead to 6–0. In the second quarter, another <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> resulted in three points for the Tigers. At <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, Auburn led, 9–0. Auburn opened the second half with its only <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> drive of the game, giving Auburn a 16–0 lead, which it held into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, Tech scored its first touchdown of the game but did not convert the <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point try</a>, making the score 16–6. Late in the quarter, Tech quarterback Bryan Randall cut Auburn's lead to 16–13 on an 80-yard <a href="forward%20pass">pass</a> that resulted in another touchdown. With almost no time remaining in the game, Virginia Tech attempted an <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a> to have another chance on offense. When Auburn recovered the kick, the Tigers <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">ran out the clock</a> and secured the win. In recognition of his game-winning performance, Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a>.

Despite Auburn's victory and undefeated season, they were not named national champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the <a href="2005%20Orange%20Bowl">2005 national championship game</a>, 55–19. Three voters in the final <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but their votes were not enough to deny USC a national championship, as voted by members of the Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the <a href="2005%20NFL%20Draft">2005 NFL Draft</a> and went on to careers in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>.

Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned automatic spots in a BCS bowl game due to their status as conference champions, and were selected by the 2005 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech finished the season 10–2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference. Auburn, meanwhile, finished the season undefeated at 12–0, and was named champion of the SEC. Controversy erupted around Auburn's selection, as the Tigers had been denied a spot in the national championship game in favor of two other undefeated teams: the <a href="USC%20Trojans%20football">University of Southern California (USC)</a> and <a href="2004%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma</a>.

The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the <a href="2004%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2004 college football season</a> having gone 8–5 in 2003, culminating with a 52–49 loss to <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">California</a> in the <a href="2003%20Insight%20Bowl">2003 Insight Bowl</a>. The 2003 season had also been Virginia Tech's final year in the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a>, and Tech began the new season in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Tech started the season unranked for the first time since 1998, and was picked to finish sixth (out of 11 ACC teams) in the annual ACC preseason poll, held in July.
The Hokies' first game in their new conference was a non-conference contest at FedEx Field in Landover, MD. against the top-ranked USC Trojans. Tech lost, 24–13, but recovered to win its next game—against lightly regarded <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan</a>—in blowout fashion, 63–0. In its first conference game in the ACC, the Hokies beat <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football">Duke</a>, 47–17, to improve to a 2–1 record. Their first win in the ACC was followed by their first loss, however, as the Hokies lost the next week to <a href="NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football">North Carolina State</a>, 17–16, when Tech kicker Brandon Pace missed a last-second <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>.

Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, and faced the potential of being <a href="Bowl%20eligible">ineligible for a postseason bowl game</a> if it did not improve its winning percentage. The Hokies won their next eight games, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a <a href="ACC%20Championship%20Game">conference championship game</a>) and a bid to a <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.

Auburn, like Virginia Tech, had gone 8–5 during the <a href="2003%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2003 college football season</a>, and entered the 2004 season with high expectations. The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme—the <a href="West%20Coast%20offense">West Coast offense</a>—and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense. In its first game of the 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the <a href="University%20of%20Louisiana-Monroe">University of Louisiana-Monroe</a>, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002. One week later, the Tigers backed up their good start with an emphatic 43–14 victory over <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> foe <a href="Mississippi%20State%20University">Mississippi State University</a>. In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked <a href="LSU%20Tigers%20football">Louisiana State Tigers</a>. In a hard-fought defensive struggle, Auburn won, 10–9, when a missed extra point was replayed after a penalty.

After an easy 33–3 victory over <a href="The%20Citadel%20%28military%20college%29">The Citadel</a>, Auburn faced eighth-ranked <a href="Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football">Tennessee</a>. The Tigers' defense forced six <a href="turnover%20%28football%29">turnovers</a> en route to a 34–10 victory. With the victory over Tennessee, Auburn reeled off another four victories and became a prominent candidate for inclusion in the national championship game. In the 11th week of the season, Auburn faced the fifth-ranked <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football">Georgia Bulldogs</a>. After a defensive effort that held Georgia scoreless until late in the fourth quarter, the third-ranked Tigers won a 24–6 victory. After defeating <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama</a> in their final regular-season game, Auburn entered the SEC championship game undefeated and in third place nationally. Although the Tigers defeated the Volunteers, 38–28, in the conference championship game, Auburn remained in third place because both USC and Oklahoma also remained undefeated. With USC and Oklahoma selected to play in the national championship game, Auburn was forced into the Sugar Bowl. With the winner of the BCS Championship Game guaranteed first place in the <a href="Coaches%20Poll">Coaches Poll</a>, Auburn fans held hopes that the combination of an overwhelming Tigers victory in the Sugar Bowl with Oklahoma defeating USC with a weak performance would cause enough voters in the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a> to put Auburn ahead of Oklahoma in their final poll. The result would have been a split national championship similar to what occurred the <a href="2003%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">previous season</a>.

In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.

Shortly after the final pre-<a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> Bowl Championship Series standings were released on December 4, Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system. One of these was <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">California</a>, which only lost to top-ranked USC, but was denied a bid to the prestigious <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Rose Bowl</a> after <a href="2004%20Texas%20Longhorns%20football%20team">Texas</a> vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record. The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less-attractive <a href="Holiday%20Bowl">Holiday Bowl</a> instead. The Auburn Tigers, meanwhile, had completed their first 12-win regular season and won their first conference championship in 15 years, but in the final BCS rankings, Auburn was third, behind USC and Oklahoma. It was the first time since the creation of the BCS in 1998 that three major-conference college football teams were undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season. Some pundits and fans considered Auburn's failure to reach the championship game to be based on the fact that the Tigers had started with a lower ranking at the beginning of the season. The Tigers had been ranked 17th at the beginning of the season, while USC had been ranked first and Oklahoma second, the same spots they occupied at the end of the regular season.

Sportswriters also pointed to the Tigers' tougher conference schedule when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked, "If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, they deserve to play for the national championship." Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, in the runup to the game, seemingly agreed with the assessment, saying, "We started out playing Southern Cal and I believe this Auburn team is better." Some writers also indicated USC's five-point win—in which the Trojans struggled—over rival <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20football">UCLA</a> as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team. In the end, such arguments were unable to sway voters, who ranked USC first, Oklahoma second, and Auburn third in all of the major polls decided by human voters. The <a href="2004%20Utah%20Utes%20football%20team">Utes</a>, who were also undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season, received limited attention because they were a member of a non-BCS conference.

Due to the controversy surrounding Auburn's failure to be given a chance to play for the national championship and controversies involving teams lobbying for improved ratings in the poll, the Associated Press sent a cease-and-desist order to BCS officials, forbidding them the use of the AP Poll in calculating BCS ratings.

Auburn head coach <a href="Tommy%20Tuberville">Tommy Tuberville</a> was named the Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24, due in large part to his success in using Auburn's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12–0 regular season. In response to his success, Auburn administrators agreed to a seven-year, $16 million contract extension with Tuberville prior to the Sugar Bowl. Tuberville planned an offense that finished the regular season averaging 33.4 points and 430.8 yards of <a href="total%20offense">total offense</a> per game.

Heading Auburn's offense on the field was quarterback Jason Campbell. Campbell finished the regular season with 2,511 yards and 19 touchdowns, one short of tying the Auburn record for most touchdowns in a single season. Campbell was second in the Southeastern Conference in <a href="forward%20pass">passing yards</a> per game (209.2), and was a first-team All-SEC selection.

Auburn's <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushing offense</a> was led by two highly regarded running backs: <a href="Carnell%20Williams">Carnell Williams</a> and <a href="Ronnie%20Brown">Ronnie Brown</a>. The two men, combined with quarterback Campbell, ran for 15,739 yards and 129 career touchdowns prior to the Sugar Bowl. Williams led the SEC in all-purpose yardage (137.2 yards per game) and average yards per <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> (11.7). He finished the regular season with 1,104 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. The touchdown mark was the most recorded by a running back in the SEC that year. For his accomplishments, Williams was named a first-team All-SEC pick. Despite missing most of his first two seasons due to injuries, he ranked second on Auburn's all-time rushing list with 3,770 yards—behind only <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a> and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">MLB</a> star <a href="Bo%20Jackson">Bo Jackson</a>. Williams also had the most rushing touchdowns in Auburn history (45) and was Auburn's leading scorer in school history (276 points). Brown accumulated 845 rushing yards and caught 34 passes for 314 yards during the season prior to the Sugar Bowl. He finished with eight touchdowns and was named a second-team All-SEC pick. His 34 receptions were 10 more than he earned in his first three seasons combined.

Despite the attention focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a>s as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, "When you have your running game making big plays and the defense has to load the box (<a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a>) to make plays and try to stop the running game, that opens up things in the passing game." Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4 per game) than running (189.4 per game).

Heading into the Sugar Bowl, the Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback <a href="Bryan%20Randall">Bryan Randall</a>, who completed 149 of 268 passes (55.6 percent) for 1,965 yards, 19 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He also rushed for 466 yards and held Tech career records for total offense and passing yards. His 37 consecutive <a href="starting%20lineup">starts</a> also are a school mark for a quarterback. In the preseason, Randall competed for the first-string quarterback spot with Marcus Vick until the latter was suspended from Tech for a semester after a criminal conviction. In the weeks leading up to the Sugar Bowl, Randall was named the Virginia Division I Offensive Player of the Year by the "<a href="Roanoke%20Times">Roanoke Times</a>" and was named the ACC Player of the Year.

Tech's rushing offense featured two running backs who shared time on the field: <a href="Mike%20Imoh">Mike Imoh</a> and <a href="Cedric%20Humes">Cedric Humes</a>. During the regular season, Imoh rushed the ball 152 times for 704 yards, an average of 4.6 yards per carry. He scored four touchdowns and set a school record for rushing yards in a game when he ran for 243 yards in Virginia Tech's game against North Carolina. Humes was on the field slightly less than Imoh, but earned 595 yards and five touchdowns on 124 carries. Tech <a href="offensive%20tackle">offensive tackle</a> Jimmy Martin was expected to play in the game after recovering from a high ankle sprain.

On special teams, Tech's Jim Davis blocked three field goals during the regular season, and teammate <a href="Darryl%20Tapp">Darryl Tapp</a> blocked a punt. Tech's success on special teams was at least partially due to head coach Frank Beamer's emphasis on that aspect of the game, a strategy known as "<a href="Frank%20Beamer%23Beamerball">Beamerball</a>." Due to Tech's acumen on special teams, Auburn was forced to spend extra time in preparing its special teams to face Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.

The Sugar Bowl was a homecoming for Tech punter Vinnie Burns, who played high school football from the Louisiana Superdome, site of the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Burns' father, Ronnie Burns, was a longtime Sugar Bowl committee member, and Vinnie committed to attend Virginia Tech while the Hokies were in New Orleans to play in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, that year's national championship game.

Before the Sugar Bowl, Auburn had the top-ranked scoring defense in the country (allowing 11.2 points per game), the fifth-ranked total defense (allowing 269.5 total yards per game), eighth in passing defense (allowing 163 yards passing per game), and 16th in rushing defense (allowing 106.5 yards rushing per game). <a href="Cornerback">Cornerback</a> Carlos Rogers was one of the key players on the defensive squad. Rogers, who won the <a href="Jim%20Thorpe%20Award">Jim Thorpe Award</a>—given annually to the best defensive back in the country—earned consensus <a href="All-America">All-America</a> honors and was a finalist for the <a href="Bronco%20Nagurski%20Award">Bronco Nagurski Award</a> and a semifinalist for the <a href="Chuck%20Bednarik%20Award">Chuck Bednarik Award</a>, each given to the best defensive college football player in the United States.

<a href="Linebacker">Linebacker</a> Travis Williams had the most <a href="Tackle%20%28football%20move%29">tackles</a> on the team during the regular season, finishing with 76. He also tied for third on the team in tackles for loss (nine), had two interceptions, two <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacks</a>, and was named a second-team All-SEC selection.

Senior <a href="Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Junior Rosegreen, freshman <a href="defensive%20end">end</a> Stanley McClover and junior <a href="nose%20guard">nose guard</a> Tommy Jackson were first-team all-SEC picks, signifying they were the best players at their position in the conference. Rosegreen had five interceptions during the regular season, including four in Auburn's game against Tennessee. That single-game performance tied the SEC record and set the Auburn record for the most interceptions in one game. Jackson finished the regular season with 49 tackles, six tackles for loss, and one sack.

Linebacker Antarrious Williams was scheduled to miss the game after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated bone suffered in the Tigers' game against Georgia. Williams had 44 tackles during the regular season, and had been replaced by Derrick Graves in the SEC championship game. Graves was expected to do so again in the Sugar Bowl.

At the conclusion of the regular season, Virginia Tech's defense was ranked third nationally in scoring defense (12.6 points allowed per game), fourth in total defense (269.5 total yards allowed per game) and fifth in pass defense (149.8 passing yards allowed per game). The Tech defense featured two highly regarded cornerbacks, Jimmy Williams and Eric Green, who finished the regular season with 50 tackles and 31 tackles, respectively. Williams also had four interceptions (the most on the team), including one returned for a touchdown, and was named first-team All-ACC. Green, meanwhile, had one interception. Auburn <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> Courtney Taylor praised the two players highly in an interview before the game, saying, "Those cornerbacks are amazing to me every time I look at them. I think, 'God, those guys are very athletic.' We're going to have our hands full."

Linebacker Mikal Baaqee was first on the team in tackles, recording 63 during the regular season. Fellow linebacker <a href="Vince%20Hall">Vince Hall</a> ranked second, with 62.

On the <a href="American%20football%20positions%23Defense">defensive line</a>, <a href="defensive%20tackle">defensive tackle</a> <a href="Jonathan%20Lewis%20%28American%20football%29">Jonathan Lewis</a> was considered a key player. Though limited by a cast protecting a broken <a href="pinky%20finger">pinky finger</a> suffered during Virginia Tech's game against Virginia, Lewis was expected to continue to perform well. Heading into the Sugar Bowl, Lewis had 38 tackles, including 10 tackles for loss and four sacks. Also on the defensive line was <a href="Darryl%20Tapp">Darryl Tapp</a>, who led the team in sacks, tackles for loss, and quarterback hurries. Tapp earned first-team All-ACC honors and had 55 tackles and one interception during the regular season.

The 2005 Sugar Bowl kicked off at 8:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> on January 3, 2005, in <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Official attendance was listed as 77,349. <a href="Mike%20Tirico">Mike Tirico</a>, <a href="Tim%20Brant">Tim Brant</a>, <a href="Terry%20Bowden">Terry Bowden</a>, and <a href="Suzy%20Shuster">Suzy Shuster</a> were the announcers for the television broadcast, which was aired on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>. About 10 million households watched the game on television in the United States, giving the game a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 9.5 and making it the 24th most popular Bowl Championship Series game in terms of television ratings. The game was also broadcast on <a href="ESPN%20Radio">ESPN Radio</a>, and was commentated by <a href="Mark%20Jones%20%28broadcaster%29">Mark Jones</a>, <a href="Bob%20Davie%20%28American%20football%29">Bob Davie</a>, and Holly Rowe. <a href="Spread%20betting">Spread bettors</a> favored Auburn to win the game by seven points.

Pregame entertainment was provided by <a href="Bowl%20Games%20of%20America">Bowl Games of America</a>, a group composed of more than 2,000 performing-arts bands, dance teams, and cheer groups from across the United States. Together, they performed the song "<a href="God%20Bless%20America">God Bless America</a>." The traditional pregame singing of the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> was sung by Brad Arnold from the band <a href="3%20Doors%20Down">3 Doors Down</a>. Dick Honig was the <a href="referee">referee</a>, the <a href="umpire">umpire</a> was Jim Krogstad, and the <a href="Lineman%20%28American%20football%29">linesman</a> was Brent Durbin.

Following the ceremonial pre-game coin toss, Auburn elected to kick off to Virginia Tech to begin the game, ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half. Tech began the first drive of the game from its 20-yard line following a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>. The Hokies initially had success moving the ball, as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game's first play, then completed a four-yard pass to wide receiver <a href="Eddie%20Royal">Eddie Royal</a> two plays later for a first down. The Auburn defense recovered, however, and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a>. Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of the game from its 26-yard line. On the Tigers' first play, quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35 yards. This was followed by another long play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31 yards. After the initial shock of the Auburn offense, the Virginia Tech defense firmed up, and Auburn's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains. Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six-yard line, Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn, who kicked a 23-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> for the game's first points. With 8:35 remaining in the first quarter, Auburn took an early 3–0 lead.

Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense attempted to answer Auburn's quick score. Unfortunately for the Hokies, their second drive fared even worse than the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass <a href="interception">intercepted</a> by Auburn <a href="Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with another long play—a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor—to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6–0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.

With time in the quarter running out, Virginia Tech fielded the post-score kickoff and executed a quick series of plays, gaining a first down before time ran out. At the end of the first quarter, Auburn held an early 6–0 lead.

Virginia Tech began the second quarter in possession of the ball and driving down the field. Bryan Randall completed a 10-yard pass for another first down, but after Tech failed to gain another, the Hokies were forced to punt. Auburn reciprocated by going <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a> and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. In its first full drive of the second quarter, the Hokies had their best drive of the first half. After a holding penalty nullified a long <a href="kickoff%20return">kickoff return</a>, Tech began at its 24-yard line. Randall completed a nine-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, then ran for another nine yards on a quarterback scramble. He followed the first-down run by completing three consecutive long passes of 16 yards, 13 yards, and 31 yards, respectively. The last pass, to wide receiver Josh Hyman, drove Virginia Tech inside the Auburn two-yard line. There, however, the Tech offense faltered. On three plays, Tech failed to cross the <a href="Goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a>, gaining only one yard in the process. Facing fourth down and needing just one yard for a touchdown, Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a> elected to attempt to gain the touchdown, rather than send in his kicker for a field goal attempt. The attempted touchdown pass by Randall fell <a href="incomplete%20pass">incomplete</a>, and Virginia Tech <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23T">turned the ball over on downs</a> without scoring any points.

Auburn's offense took over at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a successful drive that took Auburn from the shadow of its own <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>, completing passes of 16 yards, 15 yards, and 37 yards in the process. Inside the Virginia Tech <a href="red%20zone%20%28gridiron%20football%29">red zone</a>, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9–0.

With little time remaining before <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, Virginia Tech used a <a href="hurry-up%20offense">hurry-up offense</a>. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal and ran for 22 yards on his own, but threw three consecutive incomplete passes to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt the ball away, and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9–0.

The halftime show was presented by <a href="Bowl%20Games%20of%20America">Bowl Games of America</a>, a collection of <a href="Contemporary%20dance">dance troupes</a>, <a href="marching%20band">marching band</a>s, and <a href="cheerleader">cheerleading squads</a> from across the United States. Together, the organizations presented a pirate-themed show based on the character of <a href="Jean%20Lafitte">Jean Lafitte</a>, a noted <a href="brigand">brigand</a> who lived in New Orleans—site of the game—during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game, Auburn received the ball to begin the second half. The Tigers started the first drive of the second half at their 22-yard line. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays. Jason Campbell completed a pass for a five-yard loss, then, on the fifth play of the drive, completed a 53-yard pass to Anthony Mix. The pass was the longest play of the game, and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech <a href="red%20zone%20%28gridiron%20football%29">red zone</a>. Three plays later, Campbell connected with <a href="Devin%20Aromashodu">Devin Aromashodu</a> on a five-yard pass for the game's first touchdown. With 10:39 remaining in the third quarter, Auburn had taken a 16–0 lead.

After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech started its first drive of the second half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall prevented Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the <a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a>. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.

The first play of the Tech drive resulted in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an <a href="end-around">end-around</a>. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10 yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a first down, behind by 16 points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.

Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball, and facing a first down at the Auburn 10-yard line. In three consecutive plays, however, the Hokies only picked up a total of four yards. Needing six yards to get a touchdown, Virginia Tech sent in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 23-yard field goal. Despite the short distance, Pace missed the kick. With 13:56 remaining in the game, Auburn still held a 16–0 lead.

Following the missed field goal, Auburn took over on offense at its six-yard line—the point from which Tech had missed the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown returned to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16 yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.

Virginia Tech's offense came on to the field desperately needing to score quickly. Though the deficit was only 16 points, and could be made up with two touchdowns and two two-point conversions, the limited time remaining meant the task would be difficult, even if Virginia Tech scored quickly. The Hokies began the drive with a 17-yard pass by quarterback Bryan Randall. Justin Hamilton rushed for five yards, and Randall completed a six-yard pass for another first down. The Tigers helped matters by committing a 15-yard penalty, which put the Hokies inside Auburn territory. Three plays later, Randall capitalized on the opportunity by completing a 29-yard pass to Josh Morgan for a touchdown and the Hokies' first points of the game. Tech attempted a two-point conversion, but the pass attempt fell incomplete. With 6:57 remaining, Virginia Tech now trailed 16–6.

After receiving the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn began to <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">run out the clock</a>. The Tigers failed to pick up a first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10 yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.

After the ball rolled into the end zone for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall completed an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a> in order to have a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.

Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell completed 11 of 16 passes for 189 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, and was named the game's most valuable player. Despite his performance, he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game. Auburn kicker John Vaughn was successful on all three of his <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> attempts and also succeeded on his sole <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> kick in the game, resulting in 10 Auburn points. On the opposite side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38 passes for 299 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Virginia Tech kicker Branden Pace missed his sole field goal attempt of the game, a 23-yard kick.

On the ground, Auburn running back Ronnie Brown led all rushers with 68 yards on 14 carries. Second was Auburn's Carnell Williams, who gained 61 yards on 19 carries. Bryan Randall was the Hokies' leading rusher, accumulating 45 yards on nine carries. Tech's two running backs, Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes, were stymied by the Auburn defense and managed just 26 yards on 12 combined carries. Virginia Tech wide receiver Josh Morgan finished the game with three receptions for 126 yards and two touchdowns, making him the game's most prolific receiver. Auburn's Courtney Taylor was second, with five catches for 87 yards, and Tech's Josh Hyman was third with five catches for 71 yards.

For the defense, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams was the top performer. Williams had 10 tackles, including 3.5 tackles for loss, and one interception. Tech's Mikal Baaqee had eight tackles and one fumble recovery, making him the game's second-leading tackler. Auburn defender Derrick Graves was the most prolific tackler for the Tigers, making seven tackles and catching one interception of an errant Bryan Randall pass. Three players had one sack—two for Virginia Tech and one for Auburn.

With the win, Auburn finished the season undefeated, with 13 wins and zero losses. Virginia Tech's loss gave it a final record of 10–3.

The victory gave Auburn fans hope that if Oklahoma won the <a href="2005%20Orange%20Bowl">2005 BCS National Championship Game</a>, a split national championship would result. By contract, the winner of the BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll has no such restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach. <a href="2004%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team">USC</a>'s blowout 55–19 victory over <a href="2004%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma</a>, however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place. When the final college football polls of the season were released, USC was voted number one by a large margin, though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first. More than three years after the game, ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second on his list of victims of the BCS system, just behind USC being left out of the <a href="2003%20Fiesta%20Bowl">championship game in 2003</a>.

The Tigers lost 18 players due to graduation, and several juniors elected to enter the <a href="2005%20NFL%20Draft">2005 NFL Draft</a> as well. During the first round of the draft, Auburn had four players selected: Ronnie Brown, with the second overall pick, Carnell Williams (fifth), Carlos Rogers (ninth), and Jason Campbell (25th). Virginia Tech had three players selected in the 2005 draft: Eric Green (75th), Vincent Fuller (108th), and Jon Dunn (217th). Virginia Tech's appearance in the Sugar Bowl helped its recruiting efforts in the state of Virginia, with eight of the state's top recruits (ranked by the "Roanoke Times" newspaper), pledging to attend Tech.

The visiting fans of Auburn and Virginia Tech injected tens of millions of dollars into the New Orleans economy, despite high food, travel, and lodging costs that forced some fans to cut discretionary spending during their trips.

4 Minutes

"4 Minutes" is a song by American singer <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> from her eleventh studio album "<a href="Hard%20Candy%20%28Madonna%20album%29">Hard Candy</a>" (2008), featuring vocals by American singers <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>. It was released as the lead single from the album on March 17, 2008, by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>. According to Madonna, the song is about saving the environment and "having a good time while we are doing it". She also cited the song as the inspiration for the documentary "<a href="I%20Am%20Because%20We%20Are">I Am Because We Are</a>" (2008).

The song was recorded at <a href="Sarm%20West%20Studios">Sarm West Studios</a>, in London, while the mixing of the track was finished at <a href="The%20Hit%20Factory">The Hit Factory</a> studio, in New York City. Sound engineer Demo Castellon first worked on the vocals and then on the beats, while the synths were composed by Timbaland and Danja. An uptempo <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> song with an urban and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> style, "4 Minutes" incorporates Timbaland's characteristic <a href="Bhangra%20%28music%29">bhangra</a> beats and the instrumentation used in the song includes <a href="brass%20instrument">brass</a>, <a href="foghorn">foghorn</a>s and <a href="Cowbell%20%28instrument%29">cowbell</a>s. The lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed in the continent.

"4 Minutes" received positive reviews from <a href="music%20criticism">music critics</a>, who called it a busy dance track and complimented its music, which was compared to that of a marching band. Some reviewers, however, felt that Madonna sounded like a featured artist on her own song. The song peaked at number three on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, giving Madonna her 37th top-ten single, breaking the record previously held by <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, as the artist with most top-ten hits. It remains Madonna's best-selling digital single in the United States, with sales of over three million copies. Internationally, "4 Minutes" topped the charts in 21 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.

The music video shows Madonna and Timberlake singing and running away from a giant black screen that devours everything in its path. "4 Minutes" was performed by Madonna on the promotional tour for "Hard Candy" and during the rave segment of the 2008–2009 <a href="Sticky%20%26amp%3B%20Sweet%20Tour">Sticky & Sweet Tour</a>. The song received two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nominations for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Remixed%20Recording%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical</a> at the <a href="51st%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2009 ceremony</a>.

Following the release of her tenth studio album, "<a href="Confessions%20on%20a%20Dance%20Floor">Confessions on a Dance Floor</a>" (2005), Madonna wanted to record more dance music. When asked by producer <a href="Stuart%20Price">Stuart Price</a> what kind of music appealed to her, Madonna replied that she loved the records of singer <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and producer <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, so she collaborated with them. "4 Minutes" was written by all three artists, along with <a href="Danja%20%28record%20producer%29">Nate "Danja" Hills</a>, and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Danja. The song, initially named "4 Minutes to Save the World", was one of the last to be produced for Madonna's album "Hard Candy". In an interview with <a href="MTV">MTV News</a>, Madonna said that the concept of the song was developed through discussions with Timberlake. She further explained the meaning of the song:

I don't think it's important to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much more aware of the environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know at the same time we don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time while we are doing it?

Madonna clarified that her age did not have anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just something that she had in mind for a long time and with "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was "a funny paradox" and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary "<a href="I%20Am%20Because%20We%20Are">I Am Because We Are</a>" (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.

The recording sessions for "4 Minutes" took place at <a href="Sarm%20West%20Studios">Sarm West Studios</a> in West London, on a 72-channel <a href="Scratch%20Live">SSL 9080</a> scratching tool. Paul Tingen from "<a href="Sound%20on%20Sound">Sound on Sound</a>" magazine interviewed <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing</a> and <a href="sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">recording</a> engineer Demacio "Demo" Castellon, who recalled that he did not attend the first recording sessions because he was working on another project. Over half of the song was already done by the time Castellon arrived, leaving him to do the programming in the intro and the end. At Sarm, Timbaland and Danja used <a href="Music%20Production%20Center">Akai MPC3000</a> and <a href="Ensoniq%20ASR-10">Ensoniq ASR-10</a> sampling <a href="drum%20machines">drum machines</a>, <a href="Yamaha%20Motif">Yamaha Motif</a> <a href="Music%20workstation">workstation</a> and synths to build the backing track for "4 Minutes". Castellon explained that the recording session took longer than expected. In total 46 tracks were used for drums and percussion and 16 stereo tracks for the bass. The whole session included 100 tracks, and further mixing was done on Pro Tools.
In the case of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the beginning of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be to make sure that the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.
Castellon said that he did not want the SSL's internal automation to interfere with his blending of the music, instead used Pro Tools, with automatic levels. According to him, he "then ran everything through the SSL, on which [he] did EQ, compression and panning." The mixing of the track was made at <a href="The%20Hit%20Factory">The Hit Factory</a> studio, in <a href="Miami">Miami</a> on a 96-channel SSL J-series desk. Considering the quantity of recorded backing tracks, Castellon's challenge was to make sure that the music did not overpower the vocals. He accomplished this by first mixing the vocals, then adding the music and the drums, which was an unusual method for him. Minimal digital <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plug-ins</a> were employed for the mix as Castellon preferred the sound of <a href="outboard%20gear">outboard gear</a>.

After the mixes were done, Castellon began working on Timbaland's <a href="Introduction%20%28music%29">introduction</a>, and continued with Madonna and Timberlake's vocals. On Timbaland's vocals, he utilized the SSL's EQ to reduce "some bottom end", and he set input levels to avoid <a href="Clipping%20%28signal%20processing%29">clipping</a>. For Madonna and Timberlake he used SSL's <a href="dynamic%20range%20compression">dynamic range compression</a>, and on Madonna's voice he applied "an eighth-note delay from a [Lexicon] PCM42", a reverb from Eventide H3500 for the verse, and [TC Electronic] TC3000 for the hook." These digital signal processors were employed to give Madonna's vocals a sense of <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic space</a>. Castellon applied <a href="Waves%20Audio">Waves Audio</a> "Renaissance Compressor" plug-in to control the level of <a href="Bass%20drum">kick drum</a>. He recalled that "there was one particular kick sound there that clashed with the other tracks, so Tim replaced it with another kick that had a very different note and sound." Using a <a href="Focusrite">Focusrite</a> D2 equalizer let him "match the sound of that new kick drum to the other kick drum sounds". Once the drums and percussion were added, the recording and mixing of "4 Minutes" was finished.

"4 Minutes" is an uptempo <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> song, composed in an <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban</a>, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> style. It incorporates the effect of a marching band, a clanging beat and instrumentation from a <a href="brass%20instrument">brass</a> that is played in a "scale-like riff", as described by Caryn Ganz from "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>". Other musical instruments used are <a href="foghorn">foghorn</a>s and <a href="Cowbell%20%28instrument%29">cow bells</a>. In "4 Minutes", Madonna and Timberlake sing and trade <a href="verse%20%28popular%20music%29">verses</a>, the rhythm moves towards a hard clanging beat as Madonna sings the lines that the "road to hell is paved with good intentions." Madonna and Timberlake start singing the <a href="refrain">chorus</a> with Timberlake singing the line of "We've only got four minutes to save the world". The track continues in the same momentum in the second verse and second chorus whence the track ends where every beat ceases except for Timbaland's characteristic <a href="Bhangra%20%28music%29">bhangra</a> beats, the brass riffs and Madonna singing the words "tick-tock" repeatedly, after which it ends.

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by <a href="Alfred%20Publishing">Alfred Publishing</a>, the song is written in the key of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> and is set in <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> of common time with a <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 115 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start and the end of the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F to Bb. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E–D–C–D in the chorus, as its <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a>. The lyrics of "4 Minutes" carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" stated that "[h]owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from "Hard Candy" album which contains a message of social awareness in it." The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine that the line "<a href="The%20road%20to%20hell%20is%20paved%20with%20good%20intentions">The road to hell is paved with good intentions</a>" did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." Regarding the line "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, "[y]eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me."

Caryn Ganz called it "a loud, busy, energetic track", and commented that Timberlake did "his best Michael Jackson impression". Freedom du Lac of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" complimented the song for being busy and brassy. She commented: "[P]ropelled by a detonative marching-band beat [...] it's one of the most thrilling things Madonna has done in this decade." "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" music reviewer and editor <a href="Chuck%20Taylor%20%28writer%20and%20editor%29">Chuck Taylor</a> said that "There's an awful lot going on in the busy dance track [...] but the trade-off chorus between Madge and Justin of 'We've only got four minutes to save the world' is hooky enough unto itself to sell the song." He added that the song "qualifies as an event record between superpowers [Madonna and Timberlake] who not only share equal billing, but sound gangbusters together." <a href="Chris%20Williams%20%28journalist%29">Chris Williams</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called it a "flirty duet". Also from "Entertainment Weekly", Chuck Arnold felt that "['4 Minutes'] tries a little too hard — sounding more like a Timberlake-Timbaland joint than a Madonna song", but pointing its "all-star magnetism".

According to Sal Cinquemani of <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>, the song is an "advertisement for the rest of the album." <a href="Joey%20Guerra">Joey Guerra</a> of "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" compared the track to the work of <a href="Nelly%20Furtado">Nelly Furtado</a> and felt that the composition was "a bid for radio play." Andy Gill of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" called "4 Minutes" one of "<a href="Hard%20Candy%20%28Madonna%20album%29">Hard Candy</a>"s saviors. He noted that "the Mardi Gras marching-band bumping rambunctiously along", is one of the album's "most ambitious offerings." Mark Savage of <a href="BBC">BBC</a> described the sound as "so futuristic it could realistically have been beamed in from the end of the world." Ben Thompson of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" said: "It has a hard to escape sense that all concerned are going through the motions [of life] – effortlessly, sometimes brilliantly."

Joan Anderman of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" believed that the song is "chart-topper for its sheer star power as well as instant musical allure, and on the eve of Madonna's 50th birthday [...] '4 Minutes' feels a lot like an icon's can't-miss gift to herself." However, she noticed that the "shift in the power structure [is nowhere] more blatant than on '4 Minutes', where Madonna sounds like a featured guest trying to keep pace with Timbaland's colossal beats and Timberlake's nimble melody." <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> praised the melodic and rhythmic <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>, but was disappointed that Madonna's voice is "drowned out by Timbaland's farting four-note synth – which might not have been so bad if the tracks were fresher and if the whole enterprise didn't feel quite so joylessly mechanical." At the <a href="51st%20Grammy%20Awards">51st Grammy Awards</a>, "4 Minutes" garnered Madonna, Timberlake and Timbaland a nomination in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals</a> category. Dutch musician <a href="Junkie%20XL">Junkie XL</a> also earned a nomination in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Remixed%20Recording%2C%20Non-Classical">Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical</a> category for his remix of the song. While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, "The Guardian"s Jude Rogers placed "4 Minutes" at number 35, writing that "Timbaland’s synth-brass intro here is fantastic, and the song’s end-of-the-world grandeur still sounds razor-sharp", but pointing out that it would be "better without Timberlake".

In the United States, "4 Minutes" debuted at number 68 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart for the issue dated April 5, 2008, based solely on <a href="airplay">airplay</a>. Within a week, the song had jumped 65 places, reaching number three on the chart. This leap was spurred by first-week digital sales of 217,000, enabling the song to enter "Billboard"s <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Songs">Digital chart</a> at number two, behind <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a>'s single "<a href="Touch%20My%20Body%20%28Mariah%20Carey%20song%29">Touch My Body</a>". The song became Madonna's first top-ten single since "<a href="Hung%20Up">Hung Up</a>" (2005), and was her 37th Hot 100 top-ten hit, breaking the record previously held by <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>.

Overall, "4 Minutes" reached number one in 21 countries worldwide.

The music video was directed by French duo <a href="Jonas%20%26amp%3B%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Jonas & François</a> in London, England. It featured choreography by <a href="Jamie%20King">Jamie King</a>, who worked on Madonna's <a href="Confessions%20Tour">Confessions</a>, <a href="Re-Invention%20World%20Tour">Re-Invention</a> and <a href="Drowned%20World%20Tour">Drowned World</a> tours as well as her video for the single "<a href="Sorry%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Sorry</a>" (2006). Japanese hip hop dancing duo <a href="Hamutsun%20Serve">Hamutsun Serve</a> also made an appearance in the video. Before its release, "Rolling Stone" said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake act as if they were "superheroes" while they evade multiple obstacles. In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a <a href="parade">march past</a>; "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us." About the idea of a black screen devouring everything, Madonna said,

None of us did [understand the concept of the black screen]. It was just, you know, it's very conceptual. We basically gave the song to the two French directors [Jonas & François] and they came up with the only concept that I thought was interesting, with this black sort of amorphous graphic line slowly eating up the world. I just liked that as a concept.

The video used soft <a href="Focus%20%28optics%29">focus</a>, <a href="Stage%20lighting">gentle lighting</a> and airbrushing looks on Madonna. It starts with Timbaland chanting the opening line in front of a giant <a href="Timer">timer screen</a> that counts down from four minutes. As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the long lines of stalls and the people present there. As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a <a href="Asana">back arch</a> as the timer reaches zero time. The last "tick-tock, tick-tock" sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are seen in the last shot.

Regarding the video, Madonna said it was like "[g]oody goody gum drops", referring to the candy-oriented theme of the album. Virginia Heffernan from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of "<a href="Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Thriller%20%28music%20video%29">Thriller</a>, "<a href="In%20the%20Air%20Tonight">In the Air Tonight</a>" and "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. Singer <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> created her own version of the video and posted it on her <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, "All you people out there who are making videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' keep up the good work, nice job." "4 Minutes" was nominated for an award at the <a href="2008%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2008 MTV Video Music Awards</a> in the "Best Dancing in a Video" category, but lost to <a href="the%20Pussycat%20Dolls">the Pussycat Dolls</a>' single "<a href="When%20I%20Grow%20Up%20%28The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20song%29">When I Grow Up</a>". In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, "".

The song was performed during the <a href="Hard%20Candy%20%28Madonna%20album%29%23Promotion">Hard Candy Promo Tour</a> and <a href="Sticky%20%26amp%3B%20Sweet%20Tour">Sticky & Sweet Tour</a> (2008–2009). At the promotional tour, "4 Minutes" was performed as the third song of the setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots for the performance. Justin Timberlake made an appearance alongside Madonna, at the <a href="Roseland%20Ballroom">Roseland Ballroom</a> in New York, to perform the song. As Timbaland appeared on the video screens, the beat of the song started. The four side-stage video screens began to glide across the stage, and swiveled around to reveal Timberlake behind one and Madonna behind the other. They performed the song in a similar choreography from the music video.

During the "4 Minutes" performance on the Sticky & Sweet Tour, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by <a href="Heatherette">Heatherette</a>. She coupled it with metallic plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. Madonna and her dancers emerged from behind backdrops, on which Timbaland and Timberlake appeared, to perform their lines. An apparent duet between Madonna and Timberlake ensues, with Timberlake singing and dancing his part from the screens. He joined Madonna in person, for the show at Los Angeles's <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a> on November 6, 2008, the same show in which <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> appeared alongside Madonna to perform "<a href="Human%20Nature%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Human Nature</a>". They performed "4 Minutes" in similar fashion to the promotional tour choreography. Timbaland sang his part of the song in person on November 26, 2008 at <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Stadium">Dolphin Stadium</a> in <a href="Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida">Miami Gardens, Florida</a>. "4 Minutes" was also used as <a href="Mashup%20%28music%29">mashups</a> during the performance of songs like "<a href="Vogue%20%28Madonna%20song%29">Vogue</a>" and "<a href="Hung%20Up">Hung Up</a>". On July 27, 2017, Madonna made a special appearance at <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>'s annual fundraising gala, which took place on <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, and performed "4 Minutes" dressed in a green suit with feathers.

"4 Minutes" was used in the film "<a href="Get%20Smart%20%28film%29">Get Smart</a>" (2008), in a scene and its film credits. It was one of the songs covered by the cast of "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>" during the April 20, 2010 episode "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Madonna">The Power of Madonna</a>". The fictional character <a href="Kurt%20Hummel">Kurt Hummel</a>, portrayed by <a href="Chris%20Colfer">Chris Colfer</a>, sang Madonna's parts while <a href="Mercedes%20Jones">Mercedes Jones</a> (<a href="Amber%20Riley">Amber Riley</a>) sang Timberlake's. In the episode, the song is performed during a routine by the high-school cheering squad, accompanied by the school band. The version was released both as a <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a> single and on the <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>, "". The "4 Minutes" cover charted on the Hot Digital Songs of "Billboard" at number 55 on May 8, 2010, while reaching number 89 and number 70 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100, respectively.

Jack Marsh

Jack Marsh ( – 25 May 1916) was an Australian <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>er of <a href="Australian%20aborigine">Australian Aboriginal descent</a> who represented <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> in six matches from 1900–01 to 1902–03. A right-arm <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> of extreme pace, Marsh was blessed with high athletic qualities and was regarded as one of the outstanding talents of his era. His career was curtailed by continual controversy surrounding the legality of his bowling action; he was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed multiple times for <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">throwing</a>. As a result of the debate over the legitimacy of his action, Marsh never established himself at first-class level and was overlooked for <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">national selection</a>. In contemporary discourse, Marsh's lack of opportunities has often been attributed to <a href="racial%20discrimination">racial discrimination</a>.

Born into the <a href="Bundjalung%20people">Bundjalung</a> people at <a href="Yulgilbar">Yulgilbar</a> on the <a href="Clarence%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Clarence River</a> in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Marsh first made an impression as a professional <a href="track%20and%20field">runner</a>, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, but it was not until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a>ers <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> and <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a>, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in <a href="splint%20%28medicine%29">splints</a>, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a>s in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a>. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by <a href="Bob%20Crockett">Bob Crockett</a>, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.

Marsh only played in two more first-class matches, which came in the two seasons following his no-balling. In a later season, the touring <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> objected to his selection in an opposition team. There were calls for Marsh to be selected for Australia, but Noble, the New South Wales selector, refused to select him, citing his controversial action. In later years, Marsh turned to alcohol and was briefly jailed for <a href="assault">assault</a>. He was killed in a brawl outside a <a href="Australian%20pub">pub</a>; two men were charged with <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> but were acquitted.

Marsh was born into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the <a href="Clarence%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Clarence River</a> in northern New South Wales. His surname is believed to have possibly derived from that of <a href="Francis%20Henry%20Marsh">Francis Henry Marsh</a>, whose property "Camira" was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range. Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.

Marsh made his first impression in the sporting arena as a professional <a href="track%20and%20field">runner</a>, following his brother Larry to the Sydney athletics tracks in 1893. A sprinter and <a href="hurdling">hurdler</a>, Marsh had several wins in notable races. He was known for his rapid acceleration, which accounted for him being particularly strong over 75 yd. Aside from his victories in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, he travelled to race in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. As with some other Indigenous runners, Marsh was exploited by his trainer and was suspended for "<a href="match%20fixing">running stiff</a>" in Sydney in 1895. A more recent study by Max Bonnell has come to the conclusion that Marsh was a world-class sprinter. He found that "The Referee", the leading sports publication in Australia at the time, reported that Marsh had covered 100 yd in 9.8 s, which was equal to the amateur world record set by American <a href="John%20Owen%20%28sprinter%29">John Owen</a> in 1890. Marsh had also posted a time of 9.9 s in the previous year. Eight years later a publication briefly noted that Marsh's time was an Australian record.

Marsh also gained prominence in the <a href="South-Eastern%20Sydney">inner-southern Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="La%20Perouse%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">La Perouse</a>, which had a large Indigenous population, by demonstrating his <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a> skills. Marsh, while throwing boomerangs, was spotted by cricket officials and he was persuaded to take up the sport.

Marsh began playing cricket in a competition based around <a href="Moore%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moore Park</a>, near central Sydney, representing South Sydney. Marsh's career was surrounded by controversy from the outset. In November 1897, he was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed for <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">throwing</a> by William Curran in a match against <a href="Paddington%20Cricket%20Club">Paddington</a>. Following its merger with South Sydney, Marsh played for <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Club">Sydney Cricket Club</a>. Marsh's second no-ball incident at club level came when he played for a <a href="youth%20system">Colts</a> <a href="First%20eleven">XV</a> against the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales state team</a> in a trial match in November 1900, before the start of the 1900–01 <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> season. Curran called him on the first day of the match. Marsh had an eventful day, bowling Test batsmen <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, <a href="Frank%20Iredale">Frank Iredale</a> and future <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> player <a href="Bert%20Hopkins">Bert Hopkins</a>. Trumper was widely regarded as the finest batsman of his era, which was regarded as the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20cricket">"golden age"</a> of cricket, and he was seen as one of the most stylish batsmen of all time. Marsh also collected the wickets of Test batsmen and future Australian captains <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> and <a href="Syd%20Gregory">Syd Gregory</a>.

The calls of throwing so infuriated Marsh that at the end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear <a href="splint%20%28medicine%29">splints</a> when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby <a href="St%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Sydney">St. Vincent's Hospital</a>, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>" and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.

Marsh and his club sought a speedy resolution to the problem because <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> matches were due to begin in a matter of weeks. They perceived a danger that other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran's lead and call Marsh, effectively outlawing him, resulting in the loss of the club's leading strike bowler. By wearing the splints, Marsh showed his belief that Curran would call him on the second day. This never happened, because Curran withdrew from his position by the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">luncheon adjournment</a> on the second day, believing that he had been humiliated. Curran's resignation was widely criticised by the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action. Bowling "as fast as ever", Marsh went on to finish with 6/125 from 33 overs as New South Wales were bowled out for 320.

Marsh made his first-class debut when he was selected for the New South Wales team to play <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> in December 1900, just a month after he was no-balled for throwing. The selection indicated that the state selectors were prepared to overrule Curran's judgment. In a high scoring match, Marsh was the most successful of the New South Wales bowlers, taking five <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">wickets</a> for the loss of 181 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> (5/181). <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> scored 365 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, which remains the highest individual score compiled at the Adelaide Oval in a <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> match. At the time, South Australia's total of 575 was the highest ever score against New South Wales in the competition. Marsh took two early wickets to have South Australia 2/43 before Hill amassed his triple-century. He returned to take three of the last four wickets, displaying an ability to break through the defences of batsmen—all of his wickets were <a href="bowled">bowled</a>.

A week later, Marsh's action was again under scrutiny when he played his second shield match against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. While <a href="Richard%20Callaway%20%28umpire%29">Richard Callaway</a>—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart <a href="Bob%20Crockett">Bob Crockett</a> was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh three times in the match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen <a href="Peter%20McAlister">Peter McAlister</a>, <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a>, <a href="Jack%20Worrall">Jack Worrall</a> and <a href="Frank%20Laver">Frank Laver</a>. Marsh bowled three of his victims.

According to cricket historian <a href="Bernard%20Whimpress">Bernard Whimpress</a>, the early signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" of Melbourne by the name of "Old Boy". The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If "Old Boy" could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in <a href="England">England</a>. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, <a href="Jim%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Jim Phillips</a> had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler <a href="Ernie%20Jones%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Ernie Jones</a>. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.

Marsh's third Sheffield Shield match was the return fixture against South Australia in January 1901 at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> (SCG); New South Wales reversed the result of the corresponding match three weeks earlier. South Australia batted first and were bowled out for 157, with Marsh taking the leading figures of 5/34. These included the prize wickets of Hill and <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a>, Test players who went on to be inducted into the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a>. New South Wales then piled on 918 before completing an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings victory</a> by bowling the visitors out for 156 in the second innings. The margin of an innings and 605 runs set a new record for the largest victory in first-class history. Marsh took 5/59 and did the bulk of the damage, removing five of South Australia's top six specialist batsmen, at one stage reducing the visitors to 6/114. Marsh bowled six of his opponents and was not questioned by either umpire. At this point, Marsh led the first-class averages in bowling, with 21 wickets at a <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> of 17.38 in three matches. The match was Marsh's career high point; it was to be the only ten-wicket match of his brief career.

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action came to a head in the return match against Victoria at the SCG. The fixture had been slated for the <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a> weekend but it was postponed by a week when <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> died. By the time the match was under way, public interest had started to wane. Some three decades later, J. C. Davis reflected on the match, noting that it stirred many memories, "some fragrant and some rather unpleasant". The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was Crockett's continual no-balling of Marsh for throwing.

New South Wales batted first and were bowled out on the first afternoon for 170. When the Victorians began their response, Crockett called Marsh for throwing three times in his first <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>, provoking rowdy responses from the spectators. The "Sydney Mail" said the crowd reaction was "a lot of abuse and unfair criticism" of Crockett. He was no-balled a further two times in his second over and five of Victoria's first nine runs were <a href="extra%20%28cricket%29">extras</a>. Despite this, Victoria started poorly, losing five wickets by the time it reached 50 runs. Of the five wickets to fall, Marsh bowled future Test captain Armstrong and McAlister. The crowd showed its sympathy for Marsh when he rattled Armstrong's stumps; they cheered him loudly and verbally attacked Crockett. Marsh was called a total of 17 times during the innings, the most in a single first-class innings in Australia. The calls produced angry reactions from the spectators on the hill of the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>, who jeered "Crock! Crock! Crock!", regarding the umpire—not the bowler's arm—as being crooked. Marsh went on to take 2/68. At one point Marsh lost his temper and deliberately threw three consecutive balls. Despite the repeated calls, the captain <a href="Syd%20Gregory">Syd Gregory</a> kept Marsh bowling from Crockett's end—who was suspected of being biased towards his own state—rather than allowing Marsh to be examined by Crockett's partner.

Crockett's calls provoked a varied response from the media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised "uncertainty", while the "Australasian's" cricket writer <a href="Tom%20Horan">Tom Horan</a>—a Victorian who went by the pen name "Felix"—felt that Marsh was a soft target for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character. Curran's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base. The Victorian umpire was regarded as a tough-minded umpire, much like <a href="Jim%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Jim Phillips</a>, who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not. When Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match, his action was deemed by Crockett's umpiring partner <a href="Sammy%20Jones">Sammy Jones</a> to be fair. By this time, Marsh's confidence was low. He took his worst ever first-class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket. His only wicket was Test player <a href="Charlie%20McLeod">Charlie McLeod</a>, bowled for six.

Whimpress tabled various hypotheses for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 years old and was ready to emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or <a href="Jack%20Saunders%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201876%29">Jack Saunders</a>. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.

At the time, the alteration to the no-ball law made by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in 1899 was yet to be implemented in Australian first-class cricket. This change allowed the umpire to call a throw from either end, whereas the law previously barred the <a href="Umpire%20%28cricket%29%23Positions">umpire at square leg</a> from doing so. The non-implementation of the law diluted the power of Australian umpires, since the bowler could be switched to the other end and made immune from being called by the first umpire. As a result, Gregory's unwillingness to switch Marsh to the opposite end surprised cricket observers. Australian administrators had been under pressure from England to crack down on dubious bowling actions. English captain <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a> had asserted that "If Australia expects an English team next September they will have to play according to the new reading of the law at home". It was speculated that because Crockett was a lifelong employee of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, which organised and sponsored English tours to Australia, he was under pressure to no-ball bowlers in order to curry favour with English administrators.

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action again reared its head during the 1901–02 season, when MacLaren led his English tourists to Australia. The English played in a match at <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a> where Marsh was selected, but MacLaren refused to play against him. Noble, who selected the New South Wales teams, used the complaints about Marsh to ignore growing calls to have the bowler selected for New South Wales and Australia. Without state backing, the remainder of Australia's selectors were happy to rely on Noble's state-level veto to ignore Marsh. Marsh's only first-class match of the season was against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. At the time, Queensland was not yet in the Sheffield Shield, so it was a one-off match. The match was the subject of much media attention because it was the first time that two aborigines had played in opposing teams at first-class level. Queensland's Indigenous player was <a href="Alec%20Henry">Alec Henry</a>, another fast bowler who had been accused of throwing. The New South Wales team travelled north to the match by train, making a stop at <a href="Ipswich%2C%20Queensland">Ipswich</a>. As part of the media promotion of the match-up between the pair, Henry was taken to Ipswich station to meet Marsh. Marsh was reported in the media as having said "Say old man, toss me up a soft one so I can get a smack at you". Marsh took 2/64 and 3/67 in a drawn match, and bowled three of his victims, who were unable to cope with his pace. Marsh and Henry dismissed one another, each being bowled for nine to create a symmetry in the scorecard.

Marsh was again overlooked for selection during the 1902–03 Sheffield Shield season. He played his only first-class match of the season against Queensland, in another one-off match. In the last first-class fixture of his career, Marsh scored his highest first-class score of nine <a href="not%20out">not out</a> as New South Wales were bowled out for 191. He then took 2/39 in the first innings as New South Wales took a 60-run first innings lead. He finished his career with 3/23 in the second innings, including a final burst of 3/0, to help his team to a victory. Later in the season, Marsh played in a match for New South Wales against Australia, which was not first-class. He took the wicket of Clem Hill as the match ended in a draw.

Marsh was never selected again, although he continued to dominate grade cricket. He was the leading wicket-taker for three consecutive seasons from 1901–02 to 1903–04, taking a total of 158 wickets at an average of 10.94.

Two years later against <a href="Plum%20Warner">Plum Warner</a>'s MCC team, there were further calls for Marsh to be selected for the Test team as Australia fell 1–2 behind in <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a>. Marsh had taken 5/55 against the Englishmen in a match at <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, delivering a mixture of fast bowling and <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>. His victims included <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> and Warner himself. No formal complaint about Marsh's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows. The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh's bowling was unfair, with Warner describing him as a "shier", a 19th-century term for a thrower. Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action. Despite this, the English players described him as the best bowler that they had faced on the tour. Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no-ball Marsh out of the match if the Australian Test selectors picked the bowler. As a result, Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first-class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets at an average of 21.47. The Australian Test batsman and captain <a href="Warren%20Bardsley">Warren Bardsley</a> rated Marsh alongside <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a> and England's <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20, with 189 wickets at an average of just 16.43. Bardsley said that the only reason that Marsh was "kept ... out of big cricket was his color". <a href="Jack%20Pollard">Jack Pollard</a> said that Marsh "was clearly the best Australian bowler of his time but unfortunately that was a period when the <a href="White%20Australia%20policy">White Australia policy</a> prevailed. Marsh's name was scratched from the list of players ... by an official who was simply carrying out the racist customs of the day."

Popular with teammates and known for his sportsmanship, Marsh was regarded as an average <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielder</a> and had minimal batting skill, with a batting average of 5.00. He played out his days in the Sydney competition and topped the bowling aggregates from 1901 to 1904. <a href="Les%20Poidevin">Les Poidevin</a> described Marsh as "a well set-up, perfectly built ... man, with an ebony-black, smooth, clear shining skin and twinkling black eyes" who "is quite good looking". Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5 ft 7 ins (170 cm) tall. In later years, Marsh experimented with the <a href="googly">googly</a>. Photographs of Marsh often show him fashionably dressed in a suit and sporting a moustache.

When Marsh's cricket career ended in 1905, he resumed professional sprinting; in 1906, he ran against <a href="Arthur%20Postle">Arthur Postle</a> at a meeting organised by <a href="John%20Wren">John Wren</a> in Melbourne. The race was organised to give Postle, then Australia's fastest man, a chance to break the 100-yard world record. In front of 12,000 spectators on a wet track, Marsh starting from a two-yard start maintained an early lead until Postle caught him on the line. Postle was declared the winner with a 10-second time, but some observers claimed that it was a dead heat. He retired from competitive sport after the race.

Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, travelling around Australia in a <a href="Showman%23Australia">sideshow</a>, where his cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, but it is likely that he became an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an <a href="assault">assault</a> in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.

Marsh died after an assault caused by an argument outside the pool room of the Royal Hotel in <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Orange, New South Wales</a>. Two people were charged with <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, but they were acquitted. Marsh was buried in an unmarked grave. "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>" wrote in Marsh's obituary that he was "a darkly troubled man with manners which white brothers found impossible to put up with".

The Jack Marsh History Lecture, held annually by the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground%20Trust">Sydney Cricket Ground Trust</a> since 2015, is named in Marsh's honour. In 2015 <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a>'s subject was "How <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> Changed Cricket Forever". Greg de Moore in 2016 presented "<a href="Tom%20Wills">Tom Wills</a>: First Wild Man of Australian Sport", a subject he'd spent years researching.

ANAK Society

The ANAK Society is the oldest known <a href="secret%20society">secret society</a> and <a href="honor%20society">honor society</a> at the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> (Georgia Tech) in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia, United States. Founded in 1908, ANAK's purpose is "to honor outstanding juniors and seniors who have shown both exemplary leadership and a true love for Georgia Tech". The society is named after <a href="Anak">Anak</a>, a <a href="Bible">biblical</a> figure said to be the forefather of a <a href="Nephilim">race of giants</a>.

ANAK comprises at least 1,100 Georgia Tech graduates, faculty members, and honorary members. Although not founded as a secret society, it has kept its activities and membership rosters confidential since 1961. Membership is made public upon a student's graduation or a faculty member's retirement. Notable members include <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> (honorary), <a href="Bobby%20Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a> (honorary), <a href="Ivan%20Allen%20Jr.">Ivan Allen Jr.</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Jones%20%28golfer%29">Bobby Jones</a>, and most of Georgia Tech's presidents. Membership in the ANAK Society has long been considered the highest honor a Georgia Tech student can receive, although the society's activities have been the object of suspicion and controversy in recent years.

The society has been influential in the <a href="history%20of%20Georgia%20Tech">history of Georgia Tech</a>. ANAK played a major role in establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active <a href="student%20organization">student organization</a>s – including its <a href="yearbook">yearbook</a>, the <a href="Blueprint%20%28yearbook%29">"Blueprint"</a>; its <a href="student%20newspaper">student newspaper</a>, the <a href="The%20Technique">"Technique"</a>; and its Student Government Association – as well as several lasting <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20traditions">Georgia Tech traditions</a>. The society also claims involvement in a number of <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> projects, most notably in peacefully <a href="racial%20integration">integrating</a> Georgia Tech's first <a href="African-American">African-American</a> students and preventing the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech. These claims have yet to be substantiated by independent sources.

A philanthropic organization, the ANAK Society annually awards two undergraduate student scholarships, the George Wingfield Semmes Memorial Scholarship and the Merri Gaye Hitt Memorial Scholarship. Additionally, the society annually recognizes distinguished <a href="list%20of%20Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20alumni">Georgia Tech alumni</a> with the <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Pettit">Joseph M. Pettit</a> Distinguished Service Award. The society's ANAK Award, granted annually to an outstanding <a href="list%20of%20Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20faculty">Georgia Tech faculty member</a>, is considered the most prestigious award of its kind. The society has also donated a number of gifts to Georgia Tech in honor of its members and notable alumni.

The ANAK Society explained its name as originating from a passage in the <a href="Book%20of%20Numbers">Book of Numbers</a>, one of the books of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. The passage, attributed to , reads, "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight." <a href="Anak">Anak</a> was a <a href="Bible">biblical</a> figure said to be the forefather of the <a href="Nephilim">Nephilim</a>, a <a href="giant%20%28mythology%29">race of giants</a>. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 <a href="Blueprint%20%28yearbook%29">"Blue Print"</a>, the first edition of Georgia Tech's <a href="yearbook">yearbook</a>, to "ANAK" in recent editions of the "<a href="Technique%20%28newspaper%29">Technique</a>", Georgia Tech's <a href="student%20newspaper">student newspaper</a>.

The ANAK Society has adopted a number of symbols over the years, although it has never offered any official explanation as to their meaning. From its founding in 1908 to 1927, the society identified itself only by the name "Anak" or "Anak Society". In 1928 and 1929, the society adopted a "<a href="bend%20%28heraldry%29">bend sinister</a> <a href="gules">gules</a>", a type of diagonal red line borrowed from <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>. The bend was dropped after 1930, following the introduction of a crest bearing the face of a <a href="cyclops">cyclops</a> and the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> inscription ענק, meaning "Anak", both affixed to a capital letter "T". This loosely drawn crest was replaced with a more professionally illustrated version in 1940 (see right image). In later decades, the society adopted a simple lidless eye to represent itself; this symbol appeared on red ribbon <a href="armband">armband</a>s worn at ANAK "tapping" rituals and a plaque outside the Paul G. Mayer Memorial Garden on Georgia Tech's campus. Most recently, ANAK published a modernized version of its crest, a lidless eye affixed to a capital letter "T", in "The Technique" in January 2008 to commemorate its centennial anniversary.

The ANAK Society was founded on January 1, 1908 by four Georgia Tech seniors: George Wyman McCarty Jr. (President), Harry Read Vaughan (Vice President), Lewis Edward Goodier Jr. (Secretary) and Charles Atwater Sweet Jr. (Treasurer). The "guiding spirit" behind these students was said to be <a href="William%20Henry%20Emerson">William Henry Emerson</a>, a professor of chemistry. Officer titles were named after famous <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>: the president was <a href="Polyphemus">Polyphemus</a>; the vice president, Brontes; the treasurer, <a href="Stereopes">Stereopes</a>; and the secretary, <a href="Arges%20%28cyclops%29">Arges</a>. Other charter members (all seniors) were G. A. Hendrie, C. A. Adamson, S. J. Hargrove, J. E. Davenport, L. W. Robert, W. R. Snyder, <a href="Cherry%20Logan%20Emerson%20%28engineer%29">C. L. Emerson</a> (son of William Henry Emerson) and G. W. Holmes Cheney. Additional members have been initiated each subsequent year, but following the tradition set by the society's founders, no more than 12 members may be initiated per year.

In the 1909 "Blue Print", the society described its purpose as follows:
As the society's membership base grew, its influence and prestige likewise increased. By 1940, the ANAK Society was referred to as "the oldest honorary organization on the Tech campus" and membership as "the highest local honor a Tech student may obtain". These claims would generally go unchallenged throughout the rest of the century. Faculty recognition by the society, first initiated with the ANAK Award in 1942, would reach an equivalent level of prestige by the end of the century.

For many years following the ANAK Society's founding, membership was not confidential. ANAK members would select new <a href="initiation">initiates</a> by "tapping" them (tapping them on the shoulder) or presenting them with red ribbon armbands at Georgia Tech's semi-annual <a href="North-American%20Interfraternity%20Conference">Interfraternity Council</a> (IFC) dance. The ritual was dropped in 1961 when ANAK elected to become a <a href="secret%20society">secret society</a>. From this point forward, ANAK membership was made public only upon a student's graduation, via a list of graduating ANAK members published in the "Blueprint" and the "Technique" each year and the ANAK Society's home page. A similar policy applies to faculty and honorary members, whose involvement with the society is only made known upon their retirement from Georgia Tech.

The specific reasons for ANAK's transition to secrecy remain unclear. One reason, cited in several editions of the "Blueprint", offers that the society changed its policies to protect its members from fallout associated with ANAK's civil rights activities at the time. According to <a href="Gary%20S.%20May">Gary S. May</a>, the society's faculty advisor, ANAK membership is confidential because "the members don't want to exert undue influence on processes or people because of their status as a member". In contrast, critics of the society suggest that the society acts in secret to shirk accountability for any negative consequences of its activities.

By the 21st century, ANAK comprised at least 1,100 graduates, faculty members and honorary members. Among current Georgia Tech students, only upperclassmen (junior and senior undergraduates) are eligible for regular membership. Honorary memberships for faculty members and distinguished alumni are also available. The society apparently selects members based on "leadership ability, personal achievement, strong character, and love for Georgia Tech". Membership is unrestricted by race or gender, and academic achievement is not considered in the selection criteria. The society admitted its first female member, Carol A. Burtz, in 1976, 23 years after Georgia Tech began admitting women.

As the ANAK Society is ostensibly a student organization at Georgia Tech, it is subject to the same rules and regulations as other student organizations. The society files paperwork with Georgia Tech administration and the Student Government Association, holds elections for each of its four mandatory officer positions (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary) and is formally advised by a Georgia Tech faculty member. The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. In 1999, the society's faculty advisor was <a href="Gary%20S.%20May">Gary S. May</a>, an ANAK member since 1985.

The ANAK Society played a major role in establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active <a href="student%20organization">student organization</a>s, including two student publications and the <a href="student%20government">student government</a>. The society's existence was formally announced in the first edition of the "Blue Print" in 1908. Four ANAK charter members served on the first "Blue Print" <a href="editorial%20board">editorial board</a>. By 1911, ANAK admitted four more 1908 "Blue Print" editors into the society, including Editor-in-Chief John G. Chapman. These close relationships enabled the society to assert a great deal of control over the yearbook's direction in future decades. Along with several other clubs and societies, ANAK listed its membership roster and provided a group photograph in the yearbook. 

ANAK and three Georgia Tech faculty members appointed the first staff of the "Technique", Georgia Tech's student newspaper. Eugene A. Turner, secretary of the Georgia Tech <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, and Albert Blohm, an adjunct professor of English, served as the newspaper's first editors, while W. G. Perry, a junior professor of English, acted as the "Technique"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first faculty advisor. The "Technique" published its first edition on November 11, 1911, and has been in continuous weekly publication since that time, with a modern circulation of 10,000.

In the absence of an official student government during the first few decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an <a href="honor%20code">Honor Code</a>, modeled on that of <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a>'s, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.

Other student organizations ANAK claims to have established include a chapter of the YMCA in 1910 and the <a href="Ramblin%27%20Reck%20Club">Ramblin' Reck Club</a> in 1930. The former claim, however, contradicts evidence of a YMCA chapter existing before 1908, and possibly as early as 1901. In 1912, ANAK additionally formed the Koseme Society, a comparable honor society geared towards sophomores and juniors at Georgia Tech.

The ANAK Society is credited with beginning a number of lasting Georgia Tech traditions. ANAK created the "<a href="Georgia%20Tech%20traditions%23RAT%20Caps">Rat Cap</a>", a gold <a href="baseball%20cap">baseball cap</a> still distributed to new Georgia Tech students, in 1915 in response to distinctive freshman headgear popularized at other educational institutions at the time. ANAK organized the first <a href="homecoming">homecoming</a> celebration combined with an alumni reunion around 1920, a tradition that continues to this day.

Beginning in the early 1920s, the ANAK Society involved itself in a number of <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> activities. In 1921, ANAK spearheaded an effort to prevent the white supremacist <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> from setting up a chapter at Georgia Tech. The effort was successful.

Around 1960, ANAK held a series of secret dinner meetings with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three <a href="African-American">African-American</a> students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful <a href="racial%20integration">racial integration</a>.

A philanthropic organization, the ANAK Society annually awards two undergraduate student scholarships, the George Wingfield Semmes Memorial Scholarship and the Merri Gaye Hitt Memorial Scholarship. Semmes and Hitt were both Georgia Tech alumni and ANAK members; Semmes, the Class of 1910 and Hitt, the Class of 1977. Additionally, the society annually recognizes distinguished <a href="list%20of%20Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20alumni">Georgia Tech alumni</a> with the <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Pettit">Joseph M. Pettit</a> Distinguished Service Award (formerly the ANAK Service Award). Finally, since 1942 (annually since 1947), the society has presented the ANAK Award to an outstanding <a href="list%20of%20Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20faculty">Georgia Tech faculty member</a>. This award is considered "the highest honor the undergraduate student body can bestow on a Georgia Tech faculty member". For example, upon his retirement in 1999, Georgia Tech professor David J. McGill recalled winning the ANAK Award in 1990 as the highlight of his teaching career, despite having also won two Outstanding Teaching Awards (in 1974 and 1986) and being named the <a href="The%20Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching">Carnegie Foundation</a>'s Professor of the Year for the state of Georgia in 1996.
The ANAK Society has donated a number of gifts to Georgia Tech. In 1921, the society donated a staircase connecting <a href="Tech%20Tower">Tech Tower</a> to the D. P. Savant Building. The staircase bears a plaque naming ANAK as the benefactor, one of very few conspicuous declarations of the society's existence on the Georgia Tech campus. On September 26, 1947, ANAK presented a life-size bronze bust of Georgia Tech football head coach <a href="William%20Alexander%20%28coach%29">William A. Alexander</a> to the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Athletic%20Association">Georgia Tech Athletic Association</a> to commemorate the society's 40th anniversary. The bust was sculpted by <a href="Julian%20Hoke%20Harris">Julian H. Harris</a>, a noted sculptor, architect, and Georgia Tech professor from 1936 to 1972. Along with the Class of 1924, ANAK gifted a portrait of <a href="William%20Henry%20Emerson">William Henry Emerson</a>, Georgia Tech's first <a href="dean%20%28education%29">dean</a>, to Georgia Tech in 1924. The portrait was painted by noted Atlanta artist Kate Edwards. After being lost some time in the 1980s, the portrait was found and restored in the early 1990s. It has hung in the atrium of the <a href="Lyman%20Hall%20%28academic%29">Lyman Hall</a> Building since October 15, 1992. Along with the <a href="Omicron%20Delta%20Kappa">Omicron Delta Kappa</a> honor society, ANAK was involved in the dedication of the Paul G. Mayer Memorial Garden on May 30, 1987. The garden, located between the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Library">Georgia Tech Library</a> and the William Vernon Skiles Classroom Building, features a plaque bearing the lidless eye symbol of the ANAK Society.

In 2002, the ANAK Society donated a collection of its records from 1948 to 1983 to Georgia Tech. The records are publicly available through the Georgia Tech Library's Archives and Records Management Department and include constitutions, anniversary dinner invitations, and member directories.

In recent years, ANAK's influence and status as a secret society has raised suspicion and controversy among Georgia Tech students. In particular, the society had "fallen under heavy scrutiny" during a series of student government <a href="electoral%20fraud">election scandals</a> in the late 1990s.
In 1998, Marc D. Galindo, a Georgia Tech student and ANAK member, defeated competitor Vikas Chinnan in Student Government Association <a href="Two-round%20system">runoff elections</a> after Chinnan was disqualified for repeated campaign violations. The disqualification, however, was eventually overturned by the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet (the judiciary branch of student government). Although Galindo had committed a similar (but not identical nor a repeated) campaign violation, the Elections Committee did not disqualify him. Galindo had used his staff account to distribute campaign information while Chinnan had repeatedly used academic email distribution lists not available to the general public. Allegations of <a href="political%20corruption">corruption</a> erupted when two members of the Elections Committee turned out to be Galindo's fellow ANAK members; however, no proof of wrongdoing was ever uncovered. Chinnan, at the time of the election, was dating Anu Khurana, the then-president of the ANAK Society. Chinnan had agreed with and acknowledged that Galindo had not wanted him to be "disqualified on a technicality".

A similar incident occurred at Georgia Tech the following year. During Student Government Association elections in 1999, rumors circulated that Wendy Horowitz, a candidate for Student Body President, was a member of ANAK. "<a href="conspiracy%20theory">Conspiracy theories</a>" and "intense debate" ensued among students regarding the society's intentions, benevolent or otherwise. Horowitz lost the election, a result widely attributed to her purported ANAK affiliation. It was later revealed that Horowitz, in fact, had served as president of the ANAK Society for the 1999–2000 term.

As a result of these controversies, a general feeling of distrust towards the ANAK society propagated throughout the Georgia Tech campus, epitomized by an anonymous email circulated in 1999 that accused ANAK of "being the 'lapdog of President <a href="G.%20Wayne%20Clough">[G. Wayne] Clough</a>' [and] improperly influencing elections, scholarships, and the press, among other things". Critics expressed concern that ANAK members were shirking accountability for "their mistakes, their bad ideas, and their bad decisions" under the guise of eschewing "praise for their accomplishments". The Student Government Association's policy towards secret societies was called into question, resulting in a Joint Campus Organizations Committee (JCOC) resolution to consider the issue of accountability among student organization leaders. The controversial JCOC resolution, strongly opposed by ANAK representatives, would "require candidates for officer positions to recognize all campus affiliations including position and duration of involvement". The resolution failed, ensuring that ANAK membership rosters and meetings would continue to remain confidential.

The ANAK Society has granted honorary membership to a host of notable individuals associated with Georgia Tech, including former <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States senator</a> <a href="Sam%20Nunn">Sam Nunn</a>, former Georgia Tech football head coach <a href="Bobby%20Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a>, former Georgia Tech basketball head coach <a href="Bobby%20Cremins">Bobby Cremins</a>, sportscaster <a href="Al%20Ciraldo">Al Ciraldo</a>, former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States president</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> (inducted 1946), and most of Georgia Tech's presidents. Notable ANAK members who were active in the society as Georgia Tech students include former <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Atlanta">Atlanta mayor</a> <a href="Ivan%20Allen%20Jr.">Ivan Allen Jr.</a> (inducted 1933), Scientific Atlanta founder <a href="Glen%20P.%20Robinson">Glen P.

Marshalsea

The Marshalsea (1373–1842) was a notorious prison in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> (now London), just south of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. Although it housed a variety of prisoners, including men accused of crimes at sea and political figures charged with <a href="sedition">sedition</a>, it became known, in particular, for its incarceration of the poorest of London's debtors. Over half the population of England's prisons in the 18th century were in jail because of debt.

Run privately for profit, as were all English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea looked like an <a href="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> college and functioned as an extortion racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave them a chance to earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and <a href="Thumbscrew%20%28torture%29">thumbscrew</a>s. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300 inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24 hours in the warmer weather.

The prison became known around the world in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his characters on his experience, most notably <a href="Little%20Dorrit">Amy Dorrit</a>, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to get him out.

Much of the prison was demolished in the 1870s, though parts of it were used as shops and rooms into the 20th century. A local library now stands on the site. All that is left of the Marshalsea is the long brick wall that marked its southern boundary, the existence of what Dickens called "the crowding ghosts of many miserable years" recalled only by a plaque from the local council. "[I]t is gone now," he wrote, "and the world is none the worse without it."

"Marshalsea" or "marshalcy" referred to the office of a <a href="marshal">marshal</a>, derived from the <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-French</a> "mareschalcie". "Marshal" originally meant <a href="farrier">farrier</a>, from the Old Germanic "marh" (horse) and "scalc" (servant), later a title bestowed on those presiding over the courts of <a href="Middle%20Ages">Medieval Europe</a>.

"Marshalsea" was originally the name of the <a href="Marshalsea%20Court">Marshalsea Court</a>. The prison was built to hold those brought before that court and the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of the King's Bench</a>, to which Marshalsea rulings could be appealed. Also known as the Court of the Verge, and the Court of the Marshalsea of the Household of the Kings of England, the Marshalsea court was a jurisdiction of the <a href="Royal%20Households%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal household</a>. From around 1290, it governed members of the household who lived within "the verge", defined as within of the king. From 1530 to 1698 the verge was usually 12 miles around the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>, the royal family's main residence, but the Marshalsea was an ambulatory court that moved around the country with the king, dealing with trespass, contempt and debt. Increasingly it came to be used by people not connected to the royal household.

<a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> was settled by the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romans</a> around 43 AD. It served as an entry point into London from southern England, particularly along <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran into what is now Southwark's <a href="Borough%20High%20Street">Borough High Street</a> and from there north to <a href="London%20Bridge%23%26quot%3BOld%26quot%3B%20%28Medieval%29%20London%20Bridge">old London Bridge</a>. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s <a href="Tabard%20Inn">Tabard Inn</a>. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, <a href="bear%20baiting">bear baiting</a>, theatres (including <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <a href="Globe%20Theatre">Globe</a>) and prisons. In 1796 there were five prisons in Southwark—<a href="the%20Clink">the Clink</a>, <a href="King%27s%20Bench%20Prison">King's Bench</a>, <a href="Borough%20Compter">Borough Compter</a>, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.

Until the 19th century imprisonment in England was not viewed as a punishment, except for minor offences such as vagrancy. Prisons held people until their creditors had been paid or their fate decided by judges. Options included <a href="execution">execution</a> (ended 1964), flogging (1961), the <a href="stocks">stocks</a> (1872), the <a href="pillory">pillory</a> (1830), the <a href="ducking%20stool">ducking stool</a> (1817), joining the military, or <a href="penal%20transportation">penal transportation</a> to America or Australia (1867). In 1774 there were just over 4,000 prisoners in Britain, half of them debtors, out of a population of six million. (In 2010 there were over 85,000 prisoners in England and Wales out of a population of 56 million.)

Eighteenth-century prisons were effectively lodging houses. Poorly maintained and often filthy, they might consist of a couple of rooms in a cellar. Before the <a href="Gaols%20Act%201823">Gaols Act 1823</a>, then the Prisons Act of 1835 and 1877, they were administered by the royal household, the aristocracy and the bishops, and run for profit by private individuals who bought the right to manage and make money from them.

Prisoners had to pay rent, feed and clothe themselves and, in the larger prisons, furnish their rooms. One man found not guilty at trial in 1669 was not released because he owed prison fees from his pre-trial confinement, a position supported by the judge, <a href="Matthew%20Hale%20%28jurist%29">Matthew Hale</a>. Jailers sold food or let out space for others to open shops; the Marshalsea contained several shops and small restaurants. Prisoners with no money or external support faced starvation. If the prison did supply food to its non-paying inmates, it was purchased with charitable donations—donations sometimes siphoned off by the jailers—usually bread and water with a small amount of meat, or something confiscated as unfit for human consumption. Jailers would load prisoners with <a href="fetter">fetter</a>s and other iron, then charge for their removal, known as "easement of irons" (or "choice of irons"); this became known as the "trade of chains".

The prison reformer <a href="John%20Howard%20%28prison%20reformer%29">John Howard</a> travelled around the country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in "The State of the Prisons in England and Wales" (1777). In a jail owned by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The <a href="Earl%20of%20Portland%23Dukes%20of%20Portland%20%281715%29">Duke of Portland</a> had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. <a href="Earl%20of%20Arundel">Lord Arundel</a> owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11 ft x 11 ft and 6 ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.

Before the <a href="Bankruptcy%20Act%201869">Bankruptcy Act of 1869</a>, debtors in England were routinely imprisoned at the pleasure of their creditors. Around 10,000 people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to <a href="John%20Wade%20%28author%29">John Wade</a>, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under £5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to £16,442 (over £1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the <a href="Fleet%20Prison">Fleet Prison</a> closed in 1842, two debtors were found to have been there for 30 years.

Prisoners would often take their families with them, which meant that entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply to cover the cost of the imprisonment.

Legislation began to address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> (reigned 1760–1820), new legislation prevented debts of under 40 shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14 days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.
The Marshalsea occupied two buildings on the same street in Southwark. The first dated back to the 14th century at what would now be 161 Borough High Street, between King Street and Mermaid Court. By the late 16th century the building was crumbling. In 1799 the government reported that it would be rebuilt south on what is now 211 Borough High Street.

Measuring around , with a <a href="turret">turret</a>ed front lodge, the first Marshalsea was set slightly back from Borough High Street. There is no record of when it was built. Historian Jerry White writes that it existed by 1300, but according to Ida Darlington, editor of the 1955 "<a href="Survey%20of%20London">Survey of London</a>", there is a mention of "the good men of the town of Suthwerk" being granted a licence in 1373 to build a house on Southwark's High Street to hold prisoners appearing before the Marshalsea of the King's household. Darlington writes that earlier mentions of a Marshalsea prison may refer to other prisons, one kept by the <a href="Knight%20Marshal">Knight Marshal</a> at York and another at Canterbury. There is a reference to the Marshalsea prison in Southwark being set on fire in 1381 by <a href="Wat%20Tyler">Wat Tyler</a> during the <a href="Peasants%27%20Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a>.

Most of the first Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 <a href="shillings">shillings</a>. <a href="Jerry%20White%20%28historian%29">Jerry White</a> writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>", and arranged to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, both of which were more comfortable. The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> for crimes at sea.

The Marshalsea was technically under the control of the Knight Marshal, but was let out to others who ran it for profit. For example, in 1727 the Knight Marshal, <a href="Philip%20Meadowes">Philip Meadows</a>, hired John Darby, a printer, as prison governor, who in turn leased it to William Acton, a butcher (who was later tried for murdering three of its prisoners). Acton had previously worked as one of the prison's turnkeys. He paid Darby £140 a year (roughly £) for a seven-year lease, giving him the right to act as resident warden and chief turnkey, and an additional £260 for the right to collect rent from the rooms, and sell food and drink.

Much of our information about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th century, courtesy of three sources. <a href="John%20Baptist%20Grano">John Baptist Grano</a> (1692 – c. 1748), one of <a href="George%20Frederick%20Handel">George Frederick Handel</a>'s trumpeters at the opera house in London's <a href="Haymarket%20%28London%29">Haymarket</a>, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, "A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea", of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by <a href="James%20Oglethorpe">James Oglethorpe</a> MP, on the state of the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent <a href="%23Trial%20of%20William%20Acton">murder trial that year</a> of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.

By the 18th century, the prison had separate areas for its two classes of prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50 rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300 people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. <a href="John%20Baptist%20Grano">John Baptist Grano</a> paid <a href="Half%20crown%20%28British%20coin%29">2s 6d</a> (two shillings and six <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pennies</a>) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a <a href="lighterman">lighterman</a> from <a href="Bermondsey">Bermondsey</a> who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way.

Known as the castle by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, with a side room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a courtyard known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed by the sight of abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.

There was a bar run by the governor's wife, and a <a href="Chandlery">chandler's</a> shop run in 1728 by a Mr and Mrs Cary, both prisoners, which sold candles, soap and a little food. There was a coffee shop run in 1729 by a long-term prisoner, Sarah Bradshaw, and a steak house called Titty Doll's run by another prisoner, Richard McDonnell, and his wife. There was also a tailor and a barber, and prisoners from the master's side could hire prisoners from the common side to act as their servants.

The prison reformer <a href="John%20Howard%20%28prison%20reformer%29">John Howard</a> visited the Marshalsea on 16 March 1774. He reported that there was no infirmary, and that the practice of "<a href="%23Garnish%20and%20chummage">garnish</a>" was in place, whereby new prisoners were bullied into giving money to the older prisoners upon arrival. Five rooms on the master's side were being let to a man who was not a prisoner; he had set up a chandler's shop in one of them, lived in two others with his family, and sublet two to prisoners.
During Howard's visit, the tap room, or beer room, had been let to a prisoner who was living "within the rules" or "within the liberty" of the King's Bench prison; this meant that he was a King's Bench inmate who, for a fee, was allowed to live outside, within a certain radius of the prison. Although legislation prohibited jailers from having a pecuniary interest in the sale of alcohol within their prisons, it was a rule that was completely ignored. Howard reported that, in the summer of 1775, 600 pots of beer were brought into the Marshalsea one Sunday from a <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, because the prisoners did not like the beer in the tap room.

Prisoners on the master's side rarely ventured to the common side. John Baptist Grano went there just once, on 5 August 1728, writing in his diary: "I thought it would have kill'd me." There was no need for other prisoners to see it, John Ginger writes. It was enough that they knew it existed to keep the rental money, legal fees and other gratuities flowing from their families, fees that anywhere else would have seen them living in the lap of luxury, but which in the Marshalsea could be trusted merely to stave off disease and starvation.

By all accounts, living conditions in the common side were horrific. In 1639 prisoners complained that 23 women were being held in one room without space to lie down, leading to a revolt, with prisoners pulling down fences and attacking the guards with stones. Prisoners were regularly beaten with a "bull's pizzle" (a whip made from a <a href="bull%27s%20penis">bull's penis</a>), or tortured with <a href="Thumbscrew%20%28torture%20device%29">thumbscrews</a> and a skullcap, a <a href="Vise">vice</a> for the head that weighed .

What often finished them off was being forced to lie in the strong room, a windowless shed near the main sewer, next to piles of <a href="night%20soil">night soil</a> and <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s awaiting burial. Dickens described it as "dreaded by even the most dauntless highwaymen and bearable only to toads and rats". One apparently diabetic army officer who died in the strong room—he had been ejected from the common side because inmates had complained about the smell of his urine—had his face eaten by rats within hours of his death, according to a witness.

When William Acton ran the jail in the 1720s, the income from charities, collected to buy food for inmates on the common side, was directed instead to a group of trusted prisoners who policed the prison on Acton's behalf. The same group swore during <a href="%23Trial%20of%20William%20Acton">Acton's trial</a> in 1729 for murder that the strong room was the best room in the house. Ginger writes that Acton and his wife, who lived in a comfortable apartment near the lodge, knew they were sitting on a powder keg: "When each morning the smell of freshly baked bread filled ... the yard ... only brutal suppression could prevent the Common Side from erupting."
The common side did erupt after a fashion in 1728 when Robert Castell, an architect and debtor in the <a href="Fleet%20prison">Fleet prison</a>, who had been living in lodgings outside the jail within the rules, was taken to a "<a href="sponging%20house">sponging house</a>" after refusing to pay a higher prison fee to the Fleet's notorious warden, <a href="Thomas%20Bambridge">Thomas Bambridge</a>. Sponging houses were private lodgings where prisoners were incarcerated before being taken to jail; they acquired the name because they squeezed the prisoner's last money out of him. When Castell arrived at the sponging house on 14 November he was forced to share space with a man who was dying of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and as a result became infected and died less than a month later.

Castell had a friend, <a href="James%20Oglethorpe">James Oglethorpe</a>, a Tory MP who years later founded the American colony of <a href="Province%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a>. Oglethorpe began to ask questions about the treatment of debtor prisoners, and a group of debtors, perhaps at Oglethorpe's instigation, lodged a complaint about their treatment with the mayor of London and his aldermen, who interviewed the Fleet's warden on 21 December 1728.

In February 1729 the House of Commons appointed a parliamentary committee, the Gaols Committee, chaired by Oglethorpe, to examine conditions in the Fleet and Marshalsea. The committee visited the Fleet on 27 February and the Marshalsea on 25 March. <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> accompanied the committee on its visit to the Fleet, sketching it, then painting it in oil "(left)". The painting was commissioned by Sir <a href="Sir%20Archibald%20Grant%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Archibald Grant</a>, MP for Aberdeenshire, standing third from the right. The man in irons is thought to be Jacob Mendez Solas, a Portuguese prisoner.

The committee was shocked by the prisoners' living conditions. In the Fleet they found Sir William Rich, a <a href="baronet">baronet</a>, in irons. Unable to pay the prison fee, he had been burned with a red-hot poker, hit with a stick and kept in a dungeon for ten days for having wounded the warden with a shoemaker's knife. In the Marshalsea they found that prisoners on the common side were being routinely starved to death:
All the Support such poor Wretches have to subsist on, is an accidental Allowance of Pease, given once a week by a Gentleman, who conceals his Name, and about Thirty Pounds of Beef, provided by the voluntary Contribution of the Judge and Officers of the Marshalsea, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; which is divided into very small Portions, of about an Ounce and a half, distributed with One-Fourth-part of an Half-penny Loaf ...

When the miserable Wretch hath worn out the Charity of his Friends, and consumed the Money, which he hath raised upon his Cloaths, and Bedding, and hath eat his last Allowance of Provisions, he usually in a few Days grows weak, for want of Food, with the symptoms of a hectick Fever; and when he is no longer able to stand, if he can raise 3d to pay the Fee of the common Nurse of the Prison, he obtains the Liberty of being carried into the Sick Ward, and lingers on for about a Month or two, by the assistance of the above-mentioned Prison Portion of Provision, and then dies.

As a result of the Gaols Committee's inquiries, several key figures within the jails were tried for murder in August 1729, including Thomas Bambridge of the Fleet and William Acton of the Marshalsea. Given the strongly worded report of the Gaols Committee, the trials were major public events. Ginger writes that, when the <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>'s bookseller presented his bill at the end of that year, two of the 41 volumes on it were accounts of William Acton's trial.

The first case against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, was for the murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a carpenter and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that he had tried to escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20 feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.

Originally built to hold pirates, the strong room was just a few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the smell was described as "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.

Bliss was left in the strong room for three weeks wearing a skullcap (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, <a href="Fetters">leg irons</a>, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.

The court was told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar treatment from Acton: a beating, followed by time in the hole or strong room, before being moved to the sick ward, where they were left to lie on the floor in leg irons.

So concerned was Acton for his reputation that he requested the indictments be read out in Latin, but his worries were misplaced. The government wanted an acquittal to protect the good name of the Knight Marshal, Sir <a href="Philip%20Meadowes">Philip Meadows</a>, who had hired John Darby as prison governor, who in turn had leased the prison to Acton. Acton's favoured prisoners had testified on his behalf, introducing contradictory evidence that the trial judge stressed to the jury. A stream of witnesses spoke of his good character, including a judge, an MP, his butcher, brewer, confectioner and solicitor—his coal merchant thought Acton "improper for the post he was in from his too great compassion"—and he was found not guilty on all charges. The Gaols Committee had managed to draw attention to the plight of England's prisoners, but reform had eluded them.

Although most Marshalsea prisoners were debtors, the prison was second in importance only to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. From the 14th century onwards, minor political figures were held there instead of in the Tower, mostly for <a href="sedition">sedition</a>. <a href="William%20Hepworth%20Dixon">William Hepworth Dixon</a> wrote in 1885 that it was full of "poets, pirates, parsons, plotters; coiners, libellers, defaulters, Jesuits; vagabonds of every class who vexed the souls of men in power ..."

The Marshalsea became the main holding prison for <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a> suspected of sedition during the <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a>. <a href="Bishop%20Bonner">Bishop Bonner</a>, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, was imprisoned there in 1559, supposedly for his own safety, until his death 10 years later. <a href="William%20Herle%20%28spy%29">William Herle</a>, a spy for <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">Lord Burghley</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a>'s chief adviser, was held there in 1570 and 1571. According to Robyn Adams, the prison leaked both physically and metaphorically. In correspondence about Marshalsea prisoners Herle suspected of involvement in a <a href="Ridolfi%20plot">plot to kill the Queen</a>, he wrote of a network within the prison for smuggling information out of it, which included hiding letters in holes in the crumbling brickwork for others to pick up.

Intellectuals regularly found themselves in the Marshalsea. The playwright <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, a friend of Shakespeare, was jailed in 1597 for "<a href="The%20Isle%20of%20Dogs%20%28play%29">The Isle of Dogs</a>", a play that was immediately suppressed, with no extant copies; on 28 July that year the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> was told it was a "lewd plaie that was plaied in one of the plaie houses on the <a href="Bankside">Bancke Side</a>, contaynynge very seditious and sclandrous matter". The poet <a href="Christopher%20Brooke">Christopher Brooke</a> was jailed in 1601 for helping 17-year-old Ann More marry <a href="John%20Donne">John Donne</a> without her father's consent. <a href="George%20Wither">George Wither</a>, the political satirist, wrote his poem "The Shepherd's Hunting" in 1614 in the Marshalsea; he was held for four months for libel over his "Abuses Stript and Whipt", 20 satires criticizing revenge, ambition and lust, one of them directed at the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>.

<a href="Nicholas%20Udall">Nicholas Udall</a>, vicar of Braintree and headmaster of <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, was sent there in 1541 for <a href="buggery">buggery</a> and suspected theft; his appointment in 1555 as headmaster of <a href="Westminster%20School">Westminster School</a> suggests that the episode did his name no lasting harm. <a href="Thomas%20Drury%20%281551-1603%29">Thomas Drury</a> was sent to the Marshalsea on 15 July 1591, charged with "diuerse greate and fonde matters"; Drury was involved in 1593 with the allegation of atheism against the playwright <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>. In 1629 the jurist <a href="John%20Selden">John Selden</a> was jailed there for his involvement in drafting the <a href="Petition%20of%20Right">Petition of Right</a>, a document limiting the actions of the King, regarded as seditious although it had been passed by Parliament. When <a href="John%20Eliot%20%28statesman%29">Sir John Eliot</a>, Vice-Admiral of Devon, was moved to the Marshalsea in 1632 from the Tower of London for questioning the right of the King to <a href="Tonnage%20and%20Poundage">tax imports and exports</a>, he described it as leaving his palace in London for his country house in Southwark. Colonel <a href="Thomas%20Colepeper%20%28colonel%29">Thomas Culpeper</a> ended up in the Marshalsea in 1685 or 1687 for striking the Duke of Devonshire, <a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">William Cavendish</a>, on the ear.

When the prison reformer <a href="James%20Neild">James Neild</a> visited the first Marshalsea in December 1802, just 34 debtors were living there, along with eight wives and seven children. Neild wrote that it was in "a most ruinous and insecure state, and the habitations of the debtors wretched in the extreme." There had been riots in the prison in 1749 and 1768. The government acknowledged in 1799 that it had fallen into a state of decay, and a decision was made to rebuild it 130 yards south (119 m), at 150 High Street (now called Borough High Street), on the site of the White Lion prison, also known as the Borough Gaol. This was on the south side of Angel Court and Angel Alley, two narrow streets that no longer exist.

Costing £8,000 to complete (£ in 2013), the new prison opened in 1811 with two sections, one for Admiralty prisoners under court martial, and one for debtors, with a shared chapel that had been part of the White Lion.

James Neild visited the Marshalsea again during the first year of the new building's existence, publishing a description of it in 1812. This was supplemented by reports from the Committees and Commissioners on the State and Management of Prisons in London and Elsewhere, published between 1815 and 1818. More material is available in a pamphlet, "An Expose of the Practice of the Palace, or Marshalsea Court", written in 1833 by an anonymous eyewitness.

Although the first Marshalsea survived for 500 years, and the second for just 38, it is the latter that became widely known, thanks largely to <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, whose father, <a href="John%20Dickens">John Dickens</a>, was sent there on 20 February 1824, under the Insolvent Debtor's Act 1813. He owed a baker, James Kerr, £40 and 10 shillings, a sum equivalent to £ in 2019. Twelve years old at the time, Dickens was sent to live in lodgings with Mrs. Ellen Roylance in Little College Street, <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden Town</a>, from where he walked five miles (8 km) every day to Warren's blacking factory at 30 Hungerford Stairs, a factory owned by a relative of his mother's. He spent 10 hours a day wrapping bottles of shoe polish for six shillings a week to pay for his keep.

His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and her three youngest children joined her husband in the Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens would visit them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer to the prison, in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This meant he was able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work.

His father was released after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had to continue working at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in "<a href="The%20Pickwick%20Papers">The Pickwick Papers</a>" (1836–1837), "<a href="David%20Copperfield">David Copperfield</a>" (1849–1850), and most extensively in "<a href="Little%20Dorrit">Little Dorrit</a>" (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in "Little Dorrit" reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> sensibilities.

Like the first Marshalsea, the second was notoriously cramped. In 1827, 414 out of its 630 debtors were there for debts under £20; 1,890 people in Southwark were imprisoned that year for a total debt of ₤16,442.

The debtors' section consisted of a brick barracks, a yard measuring , a kitchen, a public room, and a tap room or snuggery, where debtors could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a pot in 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 of whom had been there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.

The barracks was less than 10 yards wide and 33 yards long (9 m x 30 m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, containing 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions.

Women debtors were housed in rooms over the tap room. The rooms in the barracks (the men's rooms) were square and high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share. Apart from the bed, prisoners were expected to provide their own furniture. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: "170 persons have been confined at one time within these walls, making an average of more than four persons in each room—which are not ten feet square!!! I will leave the reader to imagine what the situation of men, thus confined, particularly in the summer months, must be."

Much of the prison business was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11 am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; defacing the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.

As dreadful as the Marshalsea was, it kept the creditors away. Debtors could even arrange to have themselves arrested by a business partner to enter the jail when it suited them. Historian Margot Finn writes that discharge was therefore used as a punishment; one debtor was thrown out in May 1801 for "making a Noise and disturbance in the prison".

Upon arrival, new prisoners were expected to pay garnish, a donation to the prisoners' committee. When the commissioners reported to parliament between 1815 and 1818, male prisoners were paying five shillings and sixpence, increased to eight shillings and sixpence by the time the anonymous witness was writing in 1833. Women were asked for a smaller sum. The fee allowed prisoners to use the snuggery, where water could be boiled and meals cooked, and candles and newspapers obtained. Prisoners failing to pay were declared defaulters by the prison crier, had their names written up in the kitchen, and were <a href="Send%20to%20Coventry">sent to Coventry</a>.
After paying garnish, prisoners were given a "chum ticket", which told them which room was theirs and which prisoners they would be chumming with. They would often spend the first night in the infirmary until a room could be made ready, and sometimes three or four nights walking around the yard before a chum could be found, although they were already being charged for the room they did not have.

According to Dickens specialist Trey Philpotts, the newest arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner who was living alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14 days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.

The Admiralty division housed a few prisoners under naval <a href="courts-martial">courts-martial</a> for mutiny, desertion, piracy, and what were termed "unnatural crimes", which was, at least within the Admiralty a euphemism for sex between men, but not necessarily including sodomy. Unlike other parts of the prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty division—as well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapel—had been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed to the floor in the infirmary.

They were supposed to have a separate yard to exercise in, so that criminals were not mixing with debtors, but in fact the prisoners mixed often and happily, according to Dickens. The parliamentary committee deplored this practice, arguing that Admiralty prisoners were characterized by an "entire absence of all control", and were bound to have a bad effect on the debtors. The two groups would retreat to their own sections during inspections, Dickens wrote:
[T]he smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors ... except at certain constitutional moments when somebody came from some Office, to go through some form of overlooking something, which neither he nor anybody else knew anything about. On those truly British occasions, the smugglers, if any, made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley, while this somebody pretended to do his something; and made a reality of walking out again as soon as he hadn't done it—neatly epitomizing the administration of most of the public affairs, in our <a href="Charles%20Dibdin%23Allusions%20in%20music%20and%20literature">right little, tight little island</a>.

The presence of wives, lovers and daughters was taken for granted. Visitors could come and go freely, and even live with the prisoners, without being asked who they were. Female prisoners were allowed to mix with the men. Some of the rooms were let to prostitutes. The prison gates were closed from ten at night until eight the next morning, with a bell warning visitors half an hour before closing time, and an officer walking around the prison calling, "Strangers, women and children all out!"

According to the anonymous eyewitness, women in the Marshalsea were in constant moral danger: "How often has female virtue been assailed in poverty? Alas how often has it fallen, in consequence of a husband or a father having been a prisoner for debt?" The prison doctor would visit every other day to attend to prisoners, and sometimes their children—to "protect his reputation", according to a doctor testifying in 1815 to a parliamentary commission—but would not attend to their wives. This left women to give birth alone or with the help of other prisoners. The doctor told the commission he had helped just once with a birth, and then only as a matter of courtesy, because it was not included in his salary.

The Marshalsea was closed by an Act of Parliament in 1842, and on 19 November that year the inmates were relocated to the <a href="Bethlem%20Royal%20Hospital">Bethlem hospital</a> if they were mentally ill, or to the King's Bench Prison, at that point renamed the Queen's Prison. On 31 December 1849 the Court of the Marshalsea of the Household of the Kings of England was abolished, and its power transferred to Her Majesty's Court of Common Pleas at Westminster.

The buildings and land were auctioned off in July 1843 and purchased for £5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger. The property consisted of the keeper's house, the canteen (known as a suttling house), the Admiralty section, the chapel, a three-story brick building and eight brick houses, all closed off from Borough High Street by iron gates. Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or refusal to pay, and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.

Dickens visited what was left of the Marshalsea in May 1857, just before he finished "Little Dorrit". He wrote in the preface:
Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing. I did not know, myself, until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look. I found the outer front courtyard, often mentioned in this story, metamorphosed into a butter shop; and then I almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost. Wandering, however, down a certain adjacent "Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey", I came to "Marshalsea Place": the houses in which I recognised, not only as the great block of the former prison, but as preserving the rooms that arose in my mind's eye when I became Little Dorrit's biographer ...

A little further on, I found the older and smaller wall, which used to enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years.

The building on the site of the prison houses Southwark Council's <a href="John%20Harvard%20Library">John Harvard Library</a> and Local Studies Library, at 211 <a href="Borough%20High%20Street">Borough High Street</a>, just north of the junction with <a href="Tabard%20Street">Tabard Street</a>. All that remains of the Marshalsea is the brick wall that marked the southern boundary of the prison, separating it from St George's churchyard, now a small garden. It can be reached by underground on the Northern line to <a href="Borough%20tube%20station">Borough tube station</a>, or by train to <a href="London%20Bridge%20station">London Bridge station</a>.

The surviving wall runs along an alleyway that was part of the prison, now called Angel Place. The name Angel Place has led to confusion because there were two alleyways on the north side of the Marshalsea (Angel Court and Angel Alley), the first of which Dickens refers to when giving directions to the prison remains in 1857. See , which shows Angel Court/Angel Alley near the Borough Goal , marked by the number 2.

The wall is marked on the garden side, on what would have been the external wall of the prison, by a plaque from the local council. There is also a paving stone with information about Dickens's father. The <a href="Cuming%20Museum">Cuming Museum</a> has one of the prison's pumps and the <a href="Dickens%20House%20Museum">Dickens House Museum</a> one of its windows.

The <a href="1999%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team">Florida State Seminoles</a>, representing the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a>, defeated the <a href="1999%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a>, representing the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a>, by a score of 46–29. With the win, Florida State clinched the 1999 BCS national <a href="champion">champion</a>ship, the team's second national championship in its history.

An estimated total of 79,280 people attended the game in person, while approximately 18.4 million US viewers watched the game on <a href="ESPN%20College%20Football%20on%20ABC">ABC</a> television. The resulting 17.5 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television rating</a> was the third-largest ever recorded for a BCS college football game. Tickets were in high demand for the game, withs tens of thousands of fans from both teams attending, many using <a href="ticket%20resale">scalped tickets</a> to gain entry.

The game <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> at 8 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, and Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game. Though Tech advanced down the field, Florida State scored first and took advantage of a <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">blocked punt</a> for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>, giving the Seminoles a 14–0 lead in the first quarter. Tech answered with a touchdown drive of its own before the end of the quarter, but Florida State scored two quick touchdowns to begin the second quarter. Virginia Tech scored a touchdown before <a href="halftime">halftime</a>, but halfway through the game, Florida State held a 28–14 lead. In the third quarter, Virginia Tech's offense gave the Hokies a lead with a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> and two touchdowns. Tech failed to convert two <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>s, but held a 29–28 lead at the end of the third quarter. Florida State answered in the fourth quarter, however, taking a 36–29 lead with a touchdown and successful two-point conversion early in the quarter. From this point, the Seminoles did not relinquish the lead, extending it to 46–29 with another touchdown and a field goal.

For his performance in the game, Florida Statewide receiver <a href="Peter%20Warrick">Peter Warrick</a> was named the game's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a>. Although Tech lost the game, several of its players won postseason awards—most notably <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>, who earned an <a href="ESPY">ESPY</a> for his performance during the Sugar Bowl and the regular season. Several players from each team entered the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> after graduation, being selected either in the <a href="2000%20NFL%20Draft">2000 NFL Draft</a> or later editions of that selection process.

By contract, the top two teams in the BCS Poll at the conclusion of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (<a href="AP%20Poll">Associated Press college football poll</a> and <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">USA Today Coaches' Poll</a>), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Rose Bowl</a>, the <a href="Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a>, the <a href="Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Orange Bowl</a>, and the <a href="Fiesta%20Bowl">Fiesta Bowl</a>. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.

The Florida State Seminoles ended the <a href="1998%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1998 college football season</a> with a 23–16 loss to the <a href="Tennessee%20Volunteers%20football">Tennessee Volunteers</a> in the <a href="1999%20Fiesta%20Bowl">1999 Fiesta Bowl</a>, which was the national championship game that year. The loss was only the second of the season for Florida State, which had entered the game ranked No. 2 and favored against the No. 1 ranked Volunteers. Florida State players and coaches entered the off-season hoping to improve upon their runner-up finish in the national championship game the year before, and were voted the No. 1 team in the country in the annual Associated Press preseason poll.

Florida State lived up to its No. 1 ranking in its first game of the <a href="1999%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1999 college football season</a>, routing unranked <a href="Louisiana%20Tech">Louisiana Tech</a>, 41–7. The following week, in their ACC opener, the Seminoles had a closer contest against <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech</a>, but still earned a 41–35 victory. As the weeks went by, the wins continued to accumulate. FSU defeated <a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20Wolfpack%20football">North Carolina State</a>, 42–11; <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football">North Carolina</a>, 42–10; and <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football">Duke</a>, 51–23. In the seventh week of the college football season, the Seminoles faced off against a traditional rival: the <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami Hurricanes</a>. Heading into the game, the Seminoles were without star <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> and potential <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> candidate <a href="Peter%20Warrick">Peter Warrick</a>, who was suspended from the team after being arrested for participating in a scheme to underpay for clothes at a <a href="Tallahassee%2C%20Florida">Tallahassee, Florida</a> clothing store. Despite the loss of Warrick, Florida State eked out a 31–21 victory over the Hurricanes after being tied, 21–21, at <a href="halftime">halftime</a>.

The week after the <a href="Miami">Miami</a> game, the Seminoles had an even closer call against the <a href="Clemson%20Tigers%20football">Clemson Tigers</a>—their closest, in fact, of the entire season. Despite the return of Peter Warrick, who was cleared of charges in a Florida courtroom, Florida State fell behind the Tigers in the first half. Trailing in <a href="Clemson%2C%20South%20Carolina">Clemson, South Carolina</a>, 14–3 at halftime, Florida State cut the gap to 14–6 with a field goal midway through the third quarter, then tied the game at the end of the third quarter with a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>. The Seminoles clinched the victory after a field goal late in the fourth quarter gave them a 17–14 lead and cemented the victory when a Clemson attempt to even the score with a field goal fell short. The victory was FSU head coach <a href="Bobby%20Bowden">Bobby Bowden</a>'s 300th win and came against his son, <a href="Tommy%20Bowden">Tommy Bowden</a>, coach of the Tigers.

Florida State earned easy wins with a 35–10 victory over <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football">Virginia</a> and a 49–10 win over <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20football">Maryland</a> before facing the rival <a href="1999%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team">Florida Gators</a> in the final game of the Seminoles' regular season. Florida State led throughout the game, but had to fend off a last-minute Florida drive in order to clinch a 30–23 win and just the third perfect regular season in Florida State history. This season later was termed the "Wire to Wire" season as the Seminoles kept their No. 1 ranking the entire season.

Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies began the 1999 college football season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 9–3 during the regular season and had posted a 5–2 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which was supposed to be a rebuilding year—in the <a href="1998%20Music%20City%20Bowl">1998 Music City Bowl</a>, where the Hokies defeated the <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama Crimson Tide</a>, 38–7. With the addition of redshirt freshman <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a> to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9 points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. <a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.

In their first game of the season, the Hokies lived up to expectations, <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutting out</a> <a href="James%20Madison%20University">James Madison University</a>, 47–0. The game was the first time Tech had shut out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to Michael Vick that caused him to leave the game. The following week, against the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama%20Birmingham">University of Alabama Birmingham</a>, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 31–10 win. This was followed by a 31–11 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a <a href="Division%20I-A">Division I-A</a> opponent during the season.

Following the win over Clemson, Tech faced traditional rival Virginia in the annual battle for the <a href="Commonwealth%20Cup%20%28Virginia%29">Commonwealth Cup</a>. Despite the rivalry and the fact that Virginia was ranked the No. 24 team in the country, the Cavaliers put up even less of a struggle than Clemson. Virginia Tech won, 31–7. Now No. 5 in the country, Tech began to distance itself from other highly ranked teams with consecutive wins over <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers</a> and <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20football">Syracuse</a>. The 62–0 shutout of No. 16 Syracuse was the largest victory ever recorded against a team ranked in the AP Poll. By this time, the Hokies were being described in media reports as a national championship contender.

Following a 30–17 victory at <a href="Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football">Pittsburgh</a>, Virginia Tech traveled to <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown, West Virginia</a>, to face the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football">West Virginia Mountaineers</a> in the annual battle for the <a href="Black%20Diamond%20Trophy">Black Diamond Trophy</a>. In West Virginia, Virginia Tech eked out a 22–20 victory with a last-second <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> from <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a> <a href="Shayne%20Graham">Shayne Graham</a>. It was Tech's closest victory of the season and moved the Hokies to the No. 2 ranking in the country.

Following the win over West Virginia, Tech defeated Miami, 43–10, and <a href="Temple%20Owls">Temple</a>, 62–7, to clinch the Big East championship. In the final game of the regular season, the Hokies beat <a href="Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football">Boston College</a>, 38–14, cementing the third unbeaten season in Virginia Tech history and the Hokies' first since 1954.

In the month prior to the Sugar Bowl, media attention focused on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to national prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the national championship game. The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most national championship game appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a national championship victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent <a href="David">David</a> and <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a> showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles in the role of the overdog and the Hokies in the role of the <a href="underdog%20%28competition%29">underdog</a>. Because of this fact, <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5 points.

Tens of thousands of fans from both teams traveled to the game, often purchasing ticket and travel packages for thousands of dollars. The limited numbers of tickets available for the game were in high demand by fans of both teams.

The Seminoles threw for no fewer than 229 passing yards in every game during the regular season and averaged 12.7 points per game more than its opponents. On the ground, the Seminoles averaged 122.8 rushing yards per game.

Leading the Florida State offense was quarterback <a href="Chris%20Weinke">Chris Weinke</a>, a former baseball player who, at 27 years old, was by far the oldest player on the Seminoles' team. After suffering a neck injury in the <a href="1998%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1998 college football season</a>, Weinke recovered to complete 232 of 377 pass attempts for 3,103 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions.

Weinke's favorite target was wide receiver Peter Warrick, who led all Seminole receivers with 71 receptions and 931 yards in just nine games during the regular season. Five times, Warrick earned more than 100 receiving yards in a game. Warrick's season was shortened by a two-game suspension following his arrest for underpaying for clothes, but he still was named an <a href="All-America">All-America</a> selection at <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a>, signifying his status as one of the best players in the country at the position.

Florida State <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a> <a href="Sebastian%20Janikowski">Sebastian Janikowski</a>, who was born in Poland, also was a key component of the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83 field goal attempts, including 33 of his previous 38 kicks of less than 50 yards. Janikowski also handled <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a>s, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83 kickoffs were <a href="touchback">touchback</a>s. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.

During the regular season, Virginia Tech's offense outscored opponents by an average of 31 points per game. Tech averaged 254 yards rushing per game, the eighth-highest average in the nation. Important to that success was <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Shyrone Stith, who had 1,119 rushing yards during the regular season. Even more important to the Hokies' success, however, was quarterback <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>.

Vick was recognized by multiple nationwide publications for his performance during the regular season. His <a href="passer%20rating">passer rating</a> was the highest of any quarterback in the country, and he completed 59.2 percent of his 152 passes for 1,840 yards, 12 touchdowns, and five interceptions. In addition, He rushed for 585 yards and eight touchdowns on 108 carries. Vick was named Big East Offensive Player of the Year and was the runner-up in voting for the Associated Press Player of the Year. Vick's average of 242 yards of total offense per game were the most in the country, and his 184 passing yards per game were the second-most. In addition, Vick finished third in the voting for the <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>, traditionally given to the best college football player in the country. He was featured in multiple national publications, including on the cover of <a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> twice.

A handful of days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide receiver Ricky Hall broke a bone in his foot during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25 passes for 398 yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a>er, and had returned 40 kicks for 510 yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.

Tech placekicker <a href="Shayne%20Graham">Shayne Graham</a> won Big East Special Teams Player of the Year honors after scoring 107 points during the regular season. That mark set a Big East record, and Graham's 372 career points during his four years with the Hokies were a NCAA record at the time. Graham's award ensured Tech won all five of the Big East's player and coach of the year awards.

The Florida State defense was considered key to reining in Tech quarterback Vick. The Seminoles allowed less than 100 rushing yards per game on average, and <a href="interception">intercepted</a> 22 passes during the regular season. The Seminoles were ranked 15th nationally in pass defense at the end of the regular season but had allowed increasing amounts of pass yardage in the latter games of the season. Despite that fact, the Florida State defense's main concern was Michael Vick's ability to run the football. Said Florida State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews: "A guy like that usually gives us problems, considering the type of (4–3 gap) defense we run. When a quarterback gets out of the pocket, that could hurt us for big yardage."

The Seminole defense was led by <a href="nose%20guard">nose guard</a> <a href="Corey%20Simon">Corey Simon</a>, who accumulated 48 solo tackles, four sacks, and one interception. For his accomplishments during the regular season, Simon earned consensus first-team All-America honors. Despite his accomplishments, Simon was not the Seminoles' leading tackler. That honor went to <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> Tommy Polley, who accumulated 67 tackles during the season. Fellow linebacker Brian Allen contributed five <a href="quarterback%20sack">quarterback sack</a>s, the most in that statistical category for Florida State.

In the important category of scoring defense, the Hokies were the top-ranked defense in the country, allowing only 10.5 points per game. The team was ranked No. 3 in the country in both total defense and rushing defense. On average, Tech allowed just 247.3 total yards and 75.9 rushing yards per game. Tech's pass defense was No. 7 in the country, allowing an average of 171.4 passing yards per game. The Hokies permitted no more than 226 passing yards to any team during the regular season, and no opposing player earned 100 receiving yards. Tech defenders also accumulated 58 sacks during the season.

Virginia Tech <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Corey%20Moore">Corey Moore</a> was the top performer on the Hokie defense. Moore accumulated 55 tackles and 17 sacks during the regular season, and was named Big East Defensive Player of the Year and to the Associated Press All-America team. In the first week of December, Moore was awarded the <a href="Bronko%20Nagurski%20Trophy">Bronko Nagurski Trophy</a>, given to the best defensive college football player in the country. Tech's other defensive end was <a href="John%20Engelberger">John Engelberger</a>, who earned seven sacks, six other tackles for loss and 16 quarterback hurries. Engelberger was projected by pro scouts to be the first Tech player selected in the 2000 NFL Draft.

The 2000 Sugar Bowl kicked off at 8 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> on January 4, 2000, at the <a href="Louisiana%20Superdome">Louisiana Superdome</a>, in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. A crowd of 79,280 people attended the game in person, and an estimated 18.4 million people watched the game's television broadcast on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, earning the broadcast a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television rating</a> of 17.5, the third-highest rating ever recorded for a BCS game. ABC estimates were higher, speculating that at least 54 million people watched at least a portion of the broadcast. <a href="Brent%20Musburger">Brent Musburger</a>, <a href="Gary%20Danielson">Gary Danielson</a>, <a href="Lynn%20Swann">Lynn Swann</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Arute">Jack Arute</a> were the television commentators for the event, and <a href="Ron%20Franklin">Ron Franklin</a>, <a href="Mike%20Gottfried">Mike Gottfried</a>, and <a href="Adrian%20Karsten">Adrian Karsten</a> provided commentary for the <a href="ESPN%20Radio">ESPN Radio</a> broadcast of the game. In exchange for their performance at the game, Virginia Tech and Florida State each received more than $4 million.

The traditional pregame singing of the <a href="Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> was performed by the Zion Harmonizers, a New Orleans <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a> quartet. Steve Shaw was the <a href="referee">referee</a>. Actor <a href="John%20Goodman">John Goodman</a> performed the ceremonial pre-game <a href="Coin%20flipping">coin toss</a> to determine first possession of the ball. Florida State won the coin toss and elected to kick off to Virginia Tech to begin the game.

Virginia Tech received the game's opening kickoff in their <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a> for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the game's first play, Tech committed a five-yard false start penalty. Running back Shyrone Stith was stopped for a loss on the first non-penalty play of the game, but Tech made up both that loss and the penalty when quarterback Michael Vick <a href="quarterback%20scramble">scrambled</a> for 25 yards and a first down. Vick then ran for another nine yards, pushing the <a href="line%20of%20scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> near midfield. Tech executed an <a href="option%20run">option run</a> to Stith, who ran inside the Florida State 30-yard line. Tech picked up a few yards with a run up the middle, then Vick completed a pass to Davis, giving the Hokies a first down at the Florida State 13-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush to the six-yard line, but the Seminole defense stiffened, and Tech was unable to pick up the remaining three yards needed for a first down. Facing a fourth down and needing less than a yard to pick up another first down inside the Florida State three-yard line, Tech head coach Frank Beamer kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the first down rather than kick a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>. On the attempt, however, Vick <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball forward into the end zone, where Florida State recovered it for a touchback. Virginia Tech was thus denied the first score of the game, and Florida State's offense entered the game for the first time.

Starting at their 20-yard line after the touchback, Florida State's first play was a five-yard rush by running back Travis Minor. Quarterback Chris Weinke then completed a three-yard pass to wide receiver Peter Warrick, who was stopped short of the first down. After the next play failed to gain positive yardage, the Seminoles were forced to <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a>. Virginia Tech's offense began their second series after a short <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> to the 31-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Vick, Stith picked up a Tech first down with two running plays. From their 43-yard line, Tech executed an end-around for a first down. Florida State also committed a five-yard <a href="Football%20helmet">facemask</a> penalty that pushed Tech to the Seminoles' 40-yard line. Tech was stopped for losses on subsequent plays and committed a five-yard false start penalty, but Vick completed an 18-yard pass to Davis for a first down, making up the losses. Tech was unable to make good the losses accumulated on the next three plays, when Vick was <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> after throwing two incomplete passes. Tech punted, the ball rolled into the end zone, and Florida State's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Weinke threw two incomplete passes before connecting on a first-down throw to wide receiver Ron Dugans. On the next play, Weinke connected on a 64-yard throw to Warrick for a Florida State <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and the first points of the game. The extra point attempt was successful, and Florida State took a 7–0 lead with 3:22 remaining in the first quarter.

Following Florida State's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense began its third possession of the game at the Tech 24-yard line after a short <a href="kick%20return">kick return</a>. Running back Andre Kendrick ran for a short gain, but on the next play Vick was called for an intentional grounding penalty while attempting to avoid a sack. The Hokies were unable to make up the yardage lost by the penalty and punted after failing to gain a first down. Owing to the penalty, Tech punter Jimmy Kibble was forced to kick from his own end zone. Florida State was able to break through the Tech <a href="offensive%20line">offensive line</a> during the punt and blocked the kick. The ball was picked up by Florida State defender Jeff Chaney, who dashed into the end zone for Florida State's second touchdown of the game. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 14–0 lead with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter.

Florida State's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tech began at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the possession, Florida State committed a 15-yard pass interference penalty that gave Tech a first down at its 35-yard line. Tech was further aided by two five-yard penalties against Florida State that gave the Hokies another first down, and Vick completed a short pass across midfield. On the first play in Florida State territory, Vick completed a 49-yard throw to wide receiver André Davis for Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point attempt was good, and with 30 seconds remaining in the quarter, Tech narrowed Florida State's lead to 14–7.

Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense started work at its 20-yard line. Tech committed a five-yard penalty, and as the final seconds of the quarter ticked off, Florida State ran up the middle for five yards and a first down. At the end of the first quarter, the score was 14–7, Florida State leading.

The second quarter began with Florida State in possession of the ball, facing a first down at its 30-yard line. After picking up short yardage on two consecutive plays, Weinke completed a 63-yard pass to Dugans, who ran down the field for a touchdown. The extra point was successful, and with 13:45 remaining in the second quarter, Florida State extended its lead to 21–7. Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech returned the ball to the 33-yard line, where Tech's offense began operations. Tech committed an offensive pass interference penalty, and Tech was forced to punt after being unable to gain a first down after the penalty. The Seminoles' Peter Warrick was assigned to return the punt, and he fielded the ball at the Florida State 41-yard line. Thanks to several key blocks from other Florida State players, Warrick was able to run 59 unimpeded yards to the end zone for a touchdown. With 11:34 still remaining before halftime, the Seminoles extended their lead to 28–7.

Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech attempted to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown with one of its own. Kendrick fielded the ball at the Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, all the way to the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham attempted to run the ball for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.

On the Seminoles' first offensive play of the drive, they attempted a <a href="flea%20flicker%20%28American%20football%29">flea flicker</a> pass, which was caught by Warrick at the Virginia Tech 33-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Following the play, Weinke was sacked for the first time by the Tech defense. This was followed immediately by Tech's second sack, which pushed Weinke back into the Seminoles' side of the field. On the third play of the Seminole drive, Weinke attempted to scramble for yardage, but was stopped short of the needed mark. Florida State's punt was downed at the Virginia Tech one-yard line, which was where the Tech offense began work. Florida State's defense prevented the Hokies from gaining a first down, and Tech again had to punt from its end zone.

Following the kick and a short return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, seemingly in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss. State was able to pick up a short gain on the second play, but on the third, Weinke was sacked for the third time in the game. After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down with an option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up the middle of the field, then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown. Following the extra point, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 28–14 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half.

After the Virginia Tech kickoff and a Florida State return to their 17-yard line, Florida State began <a href="running%20out%20the%20clock">running out the clock</a> to bring the half to an end. At halftime, Florida State held a 28–14 lead over Virginia Tech.

At halftime, several organizations and groups performed under the overarching theme of a "Gospel Jubilee." The halftime show was organized by Douglas K. Green and <a href="Bowl%20Games%20of%20America">Bowl Games of America</a>, a company founded to provide similar services to bowl games across the United States. Multiple high school bands and dance teams from <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> entertained the crowd.

Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game, Florida State received the ball to begin the second half. The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play of the second half attempted a lateral pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good the needed yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short yardage on a run up the middle, then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost yardage and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.

Vick passed for six yards, then ran an option for 12 yards and a first down. Now on State's side of the field, however, the Tech offense was unable to gain another first down and punted back to Florida State, which returned the kick to its 21-yard line. State was stopped short on consecutive plays, committed a five-yard false start penalty, then was stopped for no gain on third down. After going <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a>, State punted back to the Hokies, who returned the ball to the Seminoles' 41-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Vick completed a 26-yard pass to the Tech <a href="Fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a>, Hawkins. After three rushes failed to pick up the first down at the Florida State five-yard line, Tech coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to kick a 23-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 7:54 remaining in the quarter, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 28–17.

Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Florida State's offense started a drive at its 20-yard line. Weinke completed one pass, but two others fell incomplete, and Florida State punted after again going three and out. The Hokies returned the State kick to the Seminoles' 36-yard line with a 45-yard return. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for seven yards, then handed it off to Kendrick, who broke through the Florida State defense and ran ahead 29 yards for a touchdown. Rather than attempt an extra point, Beamer ordered a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a> in an attempt to cut Florida State's lead to just three points. The play, which was Tech's first two-point attempt that season, failed. Even without an extra point, the touchdown still cut Florida State's lead to 28–23.

After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State began at its 22-yard line. Weinke completed a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the next play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget <a href="interception">intercepted</a> the ball at the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping on the field and taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the next play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22 yards on the next play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead for the first time in the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 29–28 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.

The Seminoles returned Tech's post-score kick to their 15-yard line, where Florida State's offense began work again, hoping to regain the lead for State. Weinke completed a seven-yard pass to Warrick, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. Weinke overcame the loss on the next play with a 19-yard first-down pass. State continued to advance the ball with short passes, as Weinke completed a five-yard throw. Chaney gained three yards on a rush to the right as the final seconds of the third quarter ticked off the clock, setting up an important third-down play. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led Florida State, 29–28.

Florida State began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for just short of the needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16 yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 36–29 lead with 12:59 remaining.

Tech received Florida State's kickoff at its goal line and returned the ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12 yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at the Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a <a href="penalty%20%28American%20football%29">chop block</a> before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 39–29 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.

Janikowski's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Vick and the Tech offense began at their 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first play, Davis ran for 16 yards and a first down on an end-around similar to the one he ran in the first quarter. Despite that success, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Appearing to punt the ball away, Tech ran a trick play where the punter attempted to rush for a first down. He was stopped short of the needed mark, however, and Florida State's offense returned to the field, beginning at the Tech 43-yard line. On the first play after taking over, Weinke completed a 43-yard pass to Warrick for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 46–29 lead with 7:42 remaining in the game.

With less than half a quarter remaining and down by three scores, Virginia Tech had a nearly insurmountable deficit to overcome. The Hokies fielded the kickoff for a touchback, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first and second plays of the drive, Vick was sacked for losses. The third play was an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were forced to punt. After fielding the kick at their 38-yard line, Florida State began running out the clock by running the ball. After failing to gain a first down on two consecutive rushes and an incomplete pass, Florida State punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Vick threw for short yardage, then Kendrick ran for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Vick completed a 23-yard first down pass to Emmet Johnson, and the Hokies entered Florida State territory with the clock ticking steadily down. On the first play in Seminoles' territory, Vick completed another 23-yard pass, this time to Davis, who picked up a first down at the Florida State 23-yard line. Thanks to a holding penalty against the Seminoles, Tech was granted a first down at the State eight-yard line. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for three yards, and then threw another pass to a player who was stopped short of the <a href="goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a>. Facing fourth down and needing just two yards for a touchdown, Tech attempted to pass for the touchdown, but Vick was sacked and turned the ball over on downs with 1:12 remaining. With almost no time remaining, Florida State continued running down the clock and earned the 46–29 victory.

In recognition of his performance during the game, Florida Statewide receiver Peter Warrick was named the game's most valuable player. Warrick caught six passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns, leading all receivers in yardage and scores. Warrick also had a 59-yard <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> for a touchdown and a two-point conversion, accounting for 20 of the Seminoles' 46 points. The 20 points scored by Warrick were a Sugar Bowl record for most points scored by an individual player.

Despite Warrick's individual performance, Virginia Tech was more successful in a team effort, compiling 503 total yards compared to Florida State's 359 yards. Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick completed 15 of 29 passes for 225 passing yards and one passing touchdown. Vick also ran the ball 23 times for 97 yards in his performance as the game's leading rusher. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke was the game's best passer, completing 20 of his 34 pass attempts for 329 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.

Weinke's favorite target was game MVP Peter Warrick, but several other Seminoles also benefited from Weinke's passing efficiency. Ron Dugans caught five passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns, Minnis caught two passes for 25 yards, and Minor caught two for 23 yards. For Virginia Tech, Davis caught seven passes for 108 yards and a touchdown, Hawkins caught two passes for 49 yards, and Kendrick caught two passes for 27 yards.

In terms of rushing offense, the two teams differed wildly. Virginia Tech, led by Vick, ran for 278 rushing yards. Florida State, meanwhile, ran for just 30 yards. The Seminoles were led on the ground by Chaney, who carried the ball four times for 43 yards, and Minor, who carried the ball nine times for 35 yards. Much of these two players' rushing total was negated by Chris Weinke, who lost 41 yards on seven carries. Virginia Tech, bolstered by Vick's 97 rushing yards, also saw André Kendrick accumulate 69 yards and two touchdowns with 12 carries and Shyrone Stith pick up 68 yards on 11 carries.

Florida State's victory earned it the 1999 BCS national championship and brought the Seminoles' season to an end with an undefeated 12–0 record. By beginning the season at No. 1 and ending it in the same position, Florida State became the first college football team to stay ranked No. 1 for every week of the season after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Virginia Tech's loss brought it to a final record of 11–1, but the Hokies still completed their first 11-win season in school history. The 75 total points scored in the 2000 Sugar Bowl were a Sugar Bowl record at that point in the game's history.

Both teams made changes to their respective coaching staffs in the weeks that followed the Sugar Bowl. <a href="Chuck%20Amato">Chuck Amato</a> resigned from his position as linebackers coach for Florida State to take the head coaching position at North Carolina State. His role as linebackers coach was filled by Joe Kines, whom Bobby Bowden hired from the <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football">University of Georgia</a>. Amato's role as assistant head coach was filled by Jim Gladden, who had been a coach at Florida State for more than 25 years at the time he was named the assistant head coach. At Virginia Tech, head coach Frank Beamer also made some changes to his coaching staff, promoting several position coaches to higher positions in the Tech football hierarchy.

In recognition of their achievements during the regular season and during the 2000 Sugar Bowl, multiple players and coaches from each team earned awards and recognition after the conclusion of the game. Tech quarterback Michael Vick, despite leading the losing team in the Sugar Bowl, won an <a href="ESPY">ESPY</a> for college football player of the year on February 14, more than a month after the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer won multiple coach of the year awards, most notably the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, which was presented to Beamer on March 6. One of Beamer's assistant coaches, <a href="Bud%20Foster">Bud Foster</a>, was named the top defensive coordinator in Division I-A football by American Football Coach Magazine in its annual award. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke won the 2000 Heisman Trophy after the conclusion of the <a href="2000%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2000 college football season</a>.

Several players from each team were picked by professional teams to play in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> during the <a href="2000%20NFL%20Draft">2000 NFL Draft</a>, held April 15 and 16, in New York City. Florida State had three players selected in the first round of the draft and seven players taken overall. Peter Warrick was the first player picked, selected with the fourth overall selection by the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>. <a href="Defensive%20tackle">Defensive tackle</a> <a href="Corey%20Simon">Corey Simon</a> was selected two picks later with the sixth overall selection, and placekicker <a href="Sebastian%20Janikowski">Sebastian Janikowski</a> was taken 17th. Later rounds saw <a href="Ron%20Dugans">Ron Dugans</a> (66th), <a href="Laveranues%20Coles">Laveranues Coles</a> (78th), Jerry Johnson (101st), and <a href="Mario%20Edwards">Mario Edwards</a> (180th) taken in the draft from Florida State.

Virginia Tech had no players selected in the first round of the draft but saw five players taken from the second round onward. <a href="Defensive%20end">Defensive end</a> <a href="John%20Engelberger">John Engelberger</a> was the first Hokie taken in the 2000 draft, and was picked with the 35th overall selection. He was followed by <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="Ike%20Charlton">Ike Charlton</a>, who was taken with the 52nd pick in the draft. Corey Moore (89th), Anthony Midget (134th), and Shyrone Stith (243rd) also were taken.

Some players who participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their education or because they were not three years removed from their <a href="high%20school">high school</a> graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the <a href="2001%20NFL%20Draft">2001 NFL Draft</a>.

Florida State entered the <a href="2000%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2000 college football season</a> with hopes of following up its victory in the 2000 Sugar Bowl with another national championship. The Seminoles' regular-season performance differed slightly from 1999, as they lost a regular-season game to Miami, yet still appeared in a third consecutive national championship game: the <a href="2001%20Orange%20Bowl">2001 Orange Bowl</a>. Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged on the losing side of a 13–2 score. Virginia Tech, like Florida State, had hoped to attend the national championship game again, but an injury to star quarterback Michael Vick caused the Hokies to lose a regular-season game at third-ranked Miami, eliminating them from national championship contention.

The following season, neither Florida State nor Virginia Tech competed for a national championship, but both teams played in the <a href="2002%20Gator%20Bowl">2002 Gator Bowl</a>, their first matchup in two years. Following the Gator Bowl, Florida State next met Virginia Tech in the <a href="2005%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2005 ACC Championship Game</a> after the Hokies left the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference. Florida State won that contest, 27–22. Not until the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 college football season</a> did Virginia Tech finally avenge its losses to the Seminoles with a 40–21 win en route to an Atlantic Coast Conference championship. It was the first game in fifteen consecutive matchups between the two teams that Virginia Tech had won.

John Michael Wright

John Michael Wright (May 1617 – July 1694) was a <a href="Portrait">portrait painter</a> in the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> style. Described variously as English and Scottish, Wright trained in Edinburgh under the <a href="Scotland">Scots</a> painter <a href="George%20Jamesone">George Jamesone</a>, and acquired a considerable reputation as an artist and scholar during a long sojourn in Rome. There he was admitted to the <a href="Accademia%20di%20San%20Luca">Accademia di San Luca</a>, and was associated with some of the leading artists of his generation. He was engaged by <a href="Archduke%20Leopold%20Wilhelm%20of%20Austria">Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria</a>, the governor of the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>, to acquire artworks in <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s England in 1655. He took up permanent residence in England from 1656, and served as <a href="court%20painter">court painter</a> before and after the <a href="English%20Restoration">English Restoration</a>. A convert to <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>ism, he was a favourite of the restored <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuart</a> court, a client of both <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> and <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, and was a witness to many of the political maneuverings of the era. In the final years of the Stuart monarchy he returned to Rome as part of an embassy to <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20XI">Pope Innocent XI</a>.

Wright is currently rated as one of the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive <a href="Realism%20%28visual%20arts%29">realism</a> in his portraiture. Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today.

John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself ""Anglus"" or ""Scotus"", is of uncertain origin. The diarist <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by <a href="Horace%20Walpole%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Horace Walpole</a> and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian <a href="Thomas%20Hearne%20%28antiquarian%29">Thomas Hearne</a> claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a "Mighell Wryghtt", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in <a href="St%20Bride%27s%20Church">St Bride's Church</a>, <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a>, London.

What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to <a href="George%20Jamesone">George Jamesone</a>, an <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as "Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London". The reasons for this move to <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the <a href="Royal%20Mile">High Street</a> <a href="Apartment%20building%23Scotland">tenement</a> near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of <a href="Robert%20Bruce%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ailesbury">Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury</a>, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).

It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as "related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland." If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

There is evidence to suggest that Wright went to France following his apprenticeship, however his eventual destination was Italy. It is possible that he arrived in Rome as early as 1642 in the entourage of James Alban Gibbes (a scholar of English descent), but he was certainly resident there from 1647. Although details of his time there are sketchy, his skills and reputation increased so much so that by 1648 he had become a member of the prestigious <a href="Accademia%20di%20San%20Luca">Accademia di San Luca</a> (where he is recorded as ""Michele Rita, pittore inglese""). At that time, the Accademia included numbers of established Italian painters as well as illustrious foreigners including the French <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a> and Spaniard <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a>. On 10 February that year he was elected to the "<a href="Congregazione%20dei%20Virtuosi%20al%20Pantheon">Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon</a>", a charitable body promoting the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> faith through art, which hosted an annual exhibition in the <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a>.

Wright was to spend more than ten years in Rome. During that time became an accomplished linguist as well as an established art connoisseur. He also became prosperous enough to build up a substantial collection of books, prints, paintings, gems and medals, including works attributed to <a href="Andrea%20Mantegna">Mantegna</a>, <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a>. He acquired some forty paintings – perhaps as much through dealing as collecting. <a href="Richard%20Symonds%20%28diarist%29">Richard Symonds</a>, the amateur painter and royalist, catalogued Wright's collection in the early 1650s (and designated him as "Scotus").

In 1654, after a decade in Rome, Wright travelled to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> where his abilities were recognised by <a href="Archduke%20Leopold%20Wilhelm%20of%20Austria">Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria</a> then governor of the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>. Leopold employed him not as an artist, but as an advisor on antiquities. As the younger brother of the <a href="Ferdinand%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Ferdinand III</a> and cousin of <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a>, the Archduke had the wherewithal to amass a large collection of paintings and antiquities. Moreover, in the spring of 1655, the Archduke was enjoying a period of cordial relations with <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, then <a href="The%20Protectorate">Lord Protector</a> of England. (Indeed, the two had been exchanging gifts of horses, and Leopold had provided Cromwell with choice tapestries and other artefacts for the refurbishment of the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>. Cromwell also received an embassy from the Habsburgs congratulating him on his new office.) 
Since the execution of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> in 1649, Leopold had been purchasing artworks from the royal collections and those of various aristocrats, and, against this background, commissioned Wright to travel to London and acquire further specimens. A passport was issued to him as "'Juan Miguel Rita, pintor Ingles, qua va a Inglaterra a procurar pinturas, medalas, antiguedades, y otras costa señaladas, que le hemosencargado..." to allow him to travel to England. The passport is dated 22 May 1655, and signed by the Archduke at Brussels, indicating that Wright had left Italy for <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> by this time. (The addition of the <a href="saint%27s%20name">saint's name</a> name, John, probably marks his conversion to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> at some time prior.)

As one on an official mission, Wright would probably have offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas a few weeks later – as relations between Cromwell and the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburgs</a> deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.

However, after the relocation of his patron to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Wright again visited London. On 9 April 1656 he passed through <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, and the register of visitors indicates: Perhaps tactfully, the record glosses Wright's employment in Flanders, (euphemistically referred to as "other parts") as England and the Habsburgs were now at open war, and it fails to mention his membership of the Accademia di San Luca, which would have identified him as a Roman Catholic.

Whatever his intentions, Wright did not return to Italy, rather he was joined in England by his family soon after. Despite his Roman Catholicism and the strong Protestantism of <a href="the%20Protectorate">the Protectorate</a> (1653–1659), Wright seems to have been able to find prestigious work. Indeed, Waterhouse speaks of him engaging in "the most deliberate and unblushing toadying to Cromwell" in his 1658 painting of a small posthumous portrait of Elizabeth Claypole, Oliver Cromwell's daughter (now in the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Portrait Gallery</a>). This is an allegorical portrait depicting Elizabeth as <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>, leaning on a carved relief representing the goddess springing from the head of <a href="Jove">Jove</a> with the motto ""Ab Jove Principium"" – an allusion to Cromwell himself, whose cameo portrait she holds. Seemingly, he was also willing to work the other side of the political divide: in 1659 he painted <a href="John%20Russell%20%28Royalist%29">Colonel John Russell</a> who was a player in the "<a href="Sealed%20Knot">Sealed Knot</a>" conspiracy to restore <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> to the throne. That particular portrait is regarded by at least one critic as Wright's "masterpiece".

After the <a href="English%20Restoration">restoration</a> of Charles II in 1660, Wright's Roman Catholicism became less of a handicap, due to the King's preference for religious toleration. Never a good businessman, Wright encountered some financial difficulties and King Charles granted him the privilege of disposing of his collection of <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a>s by means of a lottery. The King himself acquired 14 of the paintings. By the early 1660s Wright had established a successful studio in London, and was described by diarist <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> as "the famous painter Mr Write". Later, the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20London">Great Plague of London</a> (1665) drove Wright out to countryside, where he painted at least three members of the Catholic family of <a href="Arundell%20of%20Wardour">Arundell of Wardour</a>.

Ironically, in the next year, the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a> (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he received one of the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>'s first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length portraits of the so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising from the fire). These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir <a href="Matthew%20Hale%20%28jurist%29">Matthew Hale</a> and Sir <a href="Hugh%20Wyndham">Hugh Wyndham</a>) remain in the <a href="Guildhall%20Art%20Gallery">Guildhall Art Gallery</a> the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.

Charles II, who promoted a number of Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the monarch, seated in front of a <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> representing the <a href="Judgement%20of%20Solomon">Judgement of Solomon</a>, wearing <a href="St.%20Edward%27s%20Crown">St. Edward's Crown</a>, the robes of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Garter</a>, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at <a href="Whitehall%20Palace">Whitehall Palace</a>, and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of "picture drawer in ordinary", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures "Pictor Regis". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of "King's Painter", which was held in the 1660s by Sir <a href="Peter%20Lely">Peter Lely</a> alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on <a href="Van%20Dyck">Van Dyck</a>'s pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, "thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works".

Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never received significant recognition from King Charles. However, at least one admirer thought he did deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the <a href="Portrait%20miniature">miniaturist</a> <a href="Samuel%20Cooper">Samuel Cooper</a> had met <a href="Cosimo%20III%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany</a>. Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned a portrait of the <a href="George%20Monck%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Albemarle">Duke of Albemarle</a> from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure "Mairie Lady Hermistan" (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy. However, nothing came of the request.

As antipathy towards Catholics intensified in London from the late 1670s, Wright spent more time working away from court. He painted six family portraits for Sir <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Bagot%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Walter Bagot</a> of Blithfield in Staffordshire in 1676/7. In 1678, he removed to Dublin for a number of years, perhaps due to the anti-Catholic hysteria generated by <a href="Titus%20Oates">Titus Oates</a>'s <a href="Popish%20Plot">Popish Plot</a>. Here, still styling himself ""Pictor Regis"", he painted "The Ladies Catherine and Charlotte Talbot", which is today in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Ireland">National Gallery of Ireland</a>. He also painted two full-lengths portraits of costumed chieftains, the "<a href="Sir%20Neil%20O%27Neill">Sir Neil O'Neill</a>" (c. 1680), now in the <a href="Tate%20Collection">Tate Collection</a>, and the "Lord Mungo Murray" (c.1683), now in the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Portrait%20Gallery">Scottish National Portrait Gallery</a>. <a href="Sir%20Neil%20O%27Neill">Sir Neil O'Neill</a> was a fellow Roman Catholic, also in exile in Dublin. Wright portrayed him in the dress costume of an Irish chieftain, with suit of rare Japanese armour at his feet. The significance of this armour is that it is thought to be a coded symbol of a triumph over the persecutors of Roman Catholicism, of whom, at that time, the Japanese were notorious. The portrait of Mungo Murray (the 5th son of the Royalist <a href="John%20Murray%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Atholl">Marquis of Atholl</a>) is notable for being considered one of the first instance of Scottish <a href="tartan">tartan</a> being portrayed in art.

In 1685, when the openly Roman Catholic <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> ascended the throne, Wright was able to return to royal service. However, significantly, James did not employ Wright as an artist, but gave him the "time consuming and futile post" of steward on a diplomatic embassy. He was appointed as steward to <a href="Roger%20Palmer%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Castlemaine">Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine</a> husband of <a href="Barbara%20Palmer%2C%201st%20Duchess%20of%20Cleveland">Barbara Villiers</a>, the late King's mistress. Wright's knowledge of Rome and of the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian language</a> may have played a part in this, as Castlemaine was dispatched, in 1686, on an embassy to Pope <a href="Innocent%20XI">Innocent XI</a> to demonstrate that England could become a player on the Roman Catholic side in impending European conflicts. Wright's role in the embassy was to oversee the production of elaborate coaches, costumes and decorations for the procession, which secured a papal audience in January 1687. He also arranged a stupendous banquet for a thousand guests in the <a href="Palazzo%20Doria%20Pamphilj">Palazzo Doria Pamphilj</a>, complete with sugar sculptures and a large state portrait of James II. While in Rome, Wright published an illustrated Italian account of the embassy, dedicated to the <a href="Laura%20Martinozzi">Duchess of Modena</a> and, on his return, an English version was published in October 1687, dedicated to her daughter <a href="Mary%20of%20Modena">Queen Mary</a>.

Wright's career came to an end in 1688 with the expulsion of King James II during the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. He seems to have accepted the inevitable end of his royal favour with the accession to the throne of the Protestant <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a>. He lived on, in relative poverty, for a further six years until 1694. In March of that year, he made a will leaving his house in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's parish</a> to his niece Katherine Vaux. His collection of drawings, prints and books were left to his nephew, the painter Michael Wright; however a codicil to the will stated that the books were to be sold on behalf of his son Thomas, who was then abroad. The books were auctioned on 4 June and on 1 August 1694, John Michael Wright was buried at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>.

Much of the scholarly appreciation of Wright's work is fairly recent. In 1982, an exhibition of his work: ‘John Michael Wright – The King’s Painter’ – in the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Portrait%20Gallery">Scottish National Portrait Gallery</a> – led to a renewed interest in his contributions, and the catalogue (edited by Sara Stevenson and Duncan Thomson) re-wrote and uncovered much of the known biographical details. New works continue to be discovered and previously known ones re-attributed to him. Wright is now viewed as amongst the most successful of seventeenth-century Britain's indigenous artists, and is rated alongside contemporaries such as <a href="Robert%20Walker%20%28painter%29">Robert Walker</a> and <a href="William%20Dobson">William Dobson</a>. One modern exhibition catalogue described him as "the finest seventeenth century British-born painter". Certainly, he was one of the few who painted the elite aristocracy of his day, and was responsible for some of the most magnificent royal portraiture surviving. This achievement is particularly significant in an age where even British patrons had tended to favour foreign artists like <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a> and <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Van Dyck</a>, and would continue to favour immigrants such as Lely and <a href="Godfrey%20Kneller">Kneller</a>. Indeed, part of the reason for Wright's success is recognised as being his unusually cosmopolitan training: no prior British artist had so much exposure to European influence. During his Italian sojourn, and his participation in the <a href="Accademia%20di%20San%20Luca">Accademia di San Luca</a>, not only had Wright collected works attributed to continental giants like Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, he had also been influenced by, and even copied, much of their tone and style.

In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One <a href="art%20critic">critic</a>, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would "ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms" but that positively "they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) "(above)". Whereas Lely portrayed her as a "full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.

However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was "good but not like". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth.

Nikita Filatov

Nikita Vasilyevich Filatov (; born May 25, 1990) is a Russian professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">left winger</a> currently playing for <a href="Salavat%20Yulaev%20Ufa">Salavat Yulaev Ufa</a> of the <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL). Prior to 2012, Filatov played in North America for the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> and <a href="Columbus%20Blue%20Jackets">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL).

At the <a href="2008%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2008 NHL Entry Draft</a>, Filatov was selected sixth overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Filatov was the top-ranked European skater by the <a href="NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau">NHL Central Scouting Bureau</a>. Filatov played two seasons with the Blue Jackets organization. During the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10 season</a>, Filatov was unhappy with his situation in Columbus and was loaned to CSKA Moscow for the remainder of the season. At the <a href="2011%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2011 NHL Entry Draft</a>, the Blue Jackets then traded him to Ottawa in exchange for a third-round draft pick. In December 2011, the Senators loaned Filatov to CSKA Moscow for the balance of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20KHL%20season">2011–12 season</a>. The following season, Filatov signed with Salavat Yulaev. The Senators chose not to tender Filatov a qualifying offer, making him a free agent.

Filatov has represented Russia in international hockey at two <a href="IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championship">World U18 Championships</a>, winning gold and silver medals, and three <a href="IIHF%20World%20U20%20Championship">World Junior Championships</a>, where he has won two bronze medals. He was named to the Tournament All-Star Team at the <a href="2008%20IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championships">2008 World U18 Championships</a> and the <a href="2009%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2009 World Junior Championships</a>.

Filatov played <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey">minor</a> and <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior hockey</a> in the <a href="HC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CSKA Red Army hockey system</a> from the age of 13. At the age of 15 during the 2005–06 season, he made his debut for CSKA-2—the club's junior team—where he continued to play during the 2006–07 season, and averaged more than three points per game. In the same season, Filatov made his international debut for <a href="Russia%20men%27s%20national%20under-18%20ice%20hockey%20team">Russia</a> at the <a href="IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championship">World Under 18 Championship</a>.
During the 2007–08 season, Filatov made his professional <a href="Russian%20Superleague">Russian Superleague</a> (RSL) debut with CSKA, seeing limited action in five games. He spent the majority of the season playing at the junior level in Russia. With his CSKA junior team, Filatov played in 23 games, scoring 23 goals and providing 24 assists. Leading up to the <a href="2008%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2008 NHL Entry Draft</a>, the League's annual meeting at which the rights to amateur players are divided among teams, <a href="NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau">NHL's Central Scouting Bureau</a>, ranked Filatov as the top European skater in their mid-term and final rankings. After the 2007–08 season, Filatov was subsequently selected sixth overall at the Draft by the <a href="Columbus%20Blue%20Jackets">Columbus Blue Jackets</a>.

Filatov was also the first overall selection in the 2008 <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Hockey League</a> <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20League%23CHL%20Import%20Draft">Import Draft</a>, selected by the <a href="Sudbury%20Wolves">Sudbury Wolves</a> of the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Hockey League</a> (OHL). Sudbury General Manager <a href="Mike%20Foligno">Mike Foligno</a> was comfortable with the risks of not knowing whether Filatov would play at junior or professional level when he came to North America. Blue Jackets General Manager <a href="Scott%20Howson">Scott Howson</a> would not guarantee Filatov a place on their team, saying, "We've already told Nikita that we'll see how things go in training camp and we'll decide what's best for him."

After being drafted by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year contract with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35 million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL), however, as League President <a href="Alexander%20Medvedev">Alexander Medvedev</a> claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5 million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF) in an attempt to mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.

Filatov did not make the team after attending training camp with the Blue Jackets, instead making his North American professional debut for the Blue Jackets' <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) affiliate, the <a href="Syracuse%20Crunch">Syracuse Crunch</a>. On October 15, 2008, however, Filatov was called up to the NHL, playing in his first game and scoring his first goal with the Blue Jackets on October 17 against the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a>. For the rest of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 season</a>, Filatov split time between the AHL and the NHL. He played eight games with the Blue Jackets, finishing the season with four goals. He became the first Blue Jackets rookie to record a <a href="Hat-trick%23Hockey">hat-trick</a> in the January 10, 2009, game against the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>. At the end of the season, Filatov had played 39 games with the Crunch in the AHL, scoring 16 goals and 16 assists. For his performances, he was named as a starter for the PlanetUSA team in the 2009 <a href="AHL%20All-Star%20Game">AHL All-Star Game</a>.

At the start of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10 season</a>, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after training camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach <a href="Ken%20Hitchcock">Ken Hitchcock</a>. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia for the remainder of the season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20KHL%20season">shortened season</a> in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>, stating, "I hope I'll be back next year, but right now, it's really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision." Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.

During the off-season, the Blue Jackets sent Development Coach <a href="Tyler%20Wright">Tyler Wright</a> to Russia to train with Filatov to assess his readiness for the upcoming season, and to communicate the team's desire to work with him. Blue Jackets Head Coach <a href="Scott%20Arniel">Scott Arniel</a> was pleased to see Filatov arrive in Columbus six weeks ahead of the team's 2010–11 season, allowing him a chance to mend relationships with his teammates who may have been annoyed by Filatov's departure. Howson said the team never doubted Filatov's skill: "Nikita has the skill and the ability to play in a top-six role." Arniel was optimistic about Filatov's return to the team, offering him a clean slate and a chance to earn a spot on one of the team's top two lines. After speaking with his friend <a href="Sergei%20Shirokov">Sergei Shirokov</a> (who played for Arniel on the <a href="Manitoba%20Moose">Manitoba Moose</a>), Filatov was optimistic about working with Columbus's new head coach. Filatov started the season with the Blue Jackets at the NHL level and recorded seven assists in 23 games. In December 2010, Filatov was demoted to the AHL and spent the remainder of the season with the <a href="Springfield%20Falcons">Springfield Falcons</a>—Columbus's new AHL affiliate. With the Falcons, he played in 36 games, scoring nine goals and adding 11 assists.

At the <a href="2011%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2011 NHL Entry Draft</a>, Columbus severed their ties with Filatov, trading him to the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> in exchange for a third-round pick. Filatov left his family vacationing in the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> and joined the Senators for their development camp at <a href="Scotiabank%20Place">Scotiabank Place</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. He made the Senators out of training camp, but was a healthy scratch several times, splitting his time with Ottawa and the <a href="Binghamton%20Senators">Binghamton Senators</a> of the AHL. In November 2011, the "<a href="Ottawa%20Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a>"'s Allen Panzeri reported from sources in Columbus that Filatov had refused to play the style the Blue Jackets asked of him, saying to his coach, "Filly [Filatov] don't do rebounds." In December, the Senators offered Filatov the choice to play the rest of the season with CSKA Moscow of the KHL and Filatov agreed. Senators General Manager <a href="Bryan%20Murray%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bryan Murray</a> suggested it was better for his development as Murray felt that Filatov needed to work on becoming stronger and compete harder to make it in the NHL. Head Coach <a href="Paul%20MacLean%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Paul MacLean</a> felt Filatov's struggles in the NHL were surprising, considering he had 12 points in 15 games in the AHL. Filatov himself stated that he had to get better. MacLean had hoped that Filatov would have stayed and worked on his game in Binghamton, but Murray explained that it was more lucrative for Filatov to play in the KHL than at Binghamton, and did not block the transfer. Filatov did not immediately agree to terms with CSKA. For a few days it appeared that Filatov would not sign a contract with CSKA, so the Senators assigned him to Binghamton and threatened to suspend him in order to remove him from the Senators' salary cap. On December 18, 2011, Filatov agreed to a contract with CSKA Moscow.

Despite Filatov leaving for the KHL, the Senators still had hopes to develop Filatov. Filatov's contract was ready to expire in June 2012, and the Senators planned to make a qualifying contract offer to Filatov to retain his NHL rights. However, in May 2012, Filatov chose to stay in the KHL and agreed to a one-year contract with <a href="Salavat%20Yulaev%20Ufa">Salavat Yulaev Ufa</a>. After he signed with Salavat Yulaev, the Senators chose to not make the offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. After three seasons in the NHL, Filatov left with only six goals and eight assists in 53 NHL games. Stephen Whyno of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" identified him as one of the top five biggest "<a href="draft%20bust">draft bust</a>s" in recent NHL history. "Hockey's Future" also rated Filatov a bust.

In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20KHL%20season">2012–13</a> season, Filatov played in 47 games with Salavat Yulaev, scoring ten goals and adding 11 assists. He remained with Salavat for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20KHL%20season">2013–14</a> season.

Following the <a href="2017-18%20KHL%20season">2017–18</a> season in which Filatov split between <a href="HC%20Lada%20Togliatti">HC Lada Togliatti</a> and <a href="HC%20Neftkhimik%20Nizhnekamsk">HC Neftkhimik Nizhnekamsk</a>, Filatov left as a free agent in the off-season and continued his journeyman career in the KHL by agreeing to a one-year deal with <a href="HC%20Spartak%20Moscow">HC Spartak Moscow</a> on June 4, 2018. In the <a href="2018-19%20KHL%20season">2018–19</a> season, Filatov made a positive start to the campaign, posting 8 points in 15 games with Spartak before he was traded in a return to Salavat Yulaev Ufa in exchange for Artyom Fyodorov on November 16, 2018.

Filatov has played extensively for Russia's national teams in under-18 and under-20 tournaments. His first IIHF competition for <a href="Russia%20men%27s%20national%20under-18%20ice%20hockey%20team">Russia</a> was the <a href="2007%20IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championships">2007 U18 Championship</a> held in the Finnish cities of <a href="Rauma%2C%20Finland">Rauma</a> and <a href="Tampere">Tampere</a>. Russia won a gold medal in that tournament, and as an underaged player, Filatov contributed four goals and five assists in seven games. He led the Russian team in total points and was second to <a href="Alexei%20Cherepanov">Alexei Cherepanov</a> in goals scored. After this tournament, Russia's coaches named Filatov as one of the team's three best players. Filatov also played at the <a href="2008%20IIHF%20World%20U18%20Championships">2008 U18 Championship</a> held in his native Russia, in <a href="Kazan">Kazan</a>. Filatov captained the team to a silver medal, scoring three goals and adding six assists. He was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.

At the <a href="2008%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2008 World Junior Championship</a> in <a href="Pardubice">Pardubice</a> and <a href="Liberec">Liberec</a>, Czech Republic, Filatov made his debut with <a href="Russia%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Russia's under-20 junior squad</a>. At the tournament, he scored four goals and added five assists, leading the Russian squad in total points and placing second to <a href="Viktor%20Tikhonov%20%28ice%20hockey%2C%20born%201988%29">Viktor Tikhonov</a> in goals scored. The Russian team captured bronze at the tournament after defeating the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">United States</a> 4–2. Filatov scored two goals in the bronze medal game, and was named Russia's best player of the game by the IIHF.

The AHL's Syracuse Crunch released Filatov to participate in the <a href="2009%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2009 World Junior Championship</a> held in Ottawa. Filatov served as Russia's captain for the tournament. In seven games at the tournament, he scored eight goals and added three assists, which tied him for fourth in tournament scoring. The Russian team again captured the bronze medal, this time by defeating <a href="Slovakia%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Slovakia</a> 5–2. Filatov was named best player of the game for a preliminary round game against <a href="Finland%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Finland</a> and for the bronze medal game against Slovakia, and he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.

After returning to Russia early in the 2009–10 season, Filatov had the opportunity to compete in a third World Junior Championship at the <a href="2010%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2010 tournament</a> held in <a href="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a> and <a href="Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan">Regina</a>. As in 2009, he served as Russia's team captain. During preliminary round play, Filatov was named best player for Russia in their game against Finland. The tournament, however, was a disappointment for the Russians after they lost to <a href="Switzerland%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Switzerland</a> in the quarterfinals. Prior to the fifth place game against the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a>, Filatov was stripped of his captaincy and replaced by teammate <a href="Kirill%20Petrov">Kirill Petrov</a> after criticizing the team personnel during a <a href="media%20scrum">media scrum</a>. After participating in three World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Filatov is tied with <a href="Evgeny%20Kuznetsov">Evgeny Kuznetsov</a> as Russia's all-time leading scorer at the event—both forwards finished their junior careers with 26 points.

Scouting reports on Filatov were mixed in advance of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. <a href="Sergei%20Nemchinov">Sergei Nemchinov</a>, head coach of Russia's national junior team, said of Filatov, "He definitely has an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone." Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov "the next best thing to <a href="Steven%20Stamkos">Steven Stamkos</a>" (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 Draft). McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between <a href="Ilya%20Kovalchuk">Ilya Kovalchuk</a> and <a href="Maxim%20Afinogenov">Maxim Afinogenov</a>. His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity. The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, "Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent." Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, however, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities. Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.

Filatov was born in Moscow, Russia, to parents Slava and Yelena. He speaks fluent English due in large part to his mother—an English teacher who used to give him lessons at home. When he started playing professional hockey in North America for Syracuse, his mother stayed for several weeks to help him get acclimated to his new surroundings.

Krulak–Mendenhall mission

The Krulak–Mendenhall mission was a fact-finding expedition dispatched by the <a href="Kennedy%20administration">Kennedy administration</a> to <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> in early September 1963. The stated purpose of the expedition was to investigate the progress of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">war</a> by the <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>ese regime and its <a href="US%20military">US military</a> advisers against the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> insurgency. The mission was led by <a href="Victor%20Krulak">Victor Krulak</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Mendenhall">Joseph Mendenhall</a>. Krulak was a major general in the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, while Mendenhall was a senior <a href="United%20States%20Foreign%20Service">Foreign Service Officer</a> experienced in dealing with <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>ese affairs.

The four-day whirlwind trip was launched on September 6, 1963, the same day as a <a href="United%20States%20National%20Security%20Council">National Security Council</a> (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake of increasingly strained relations between the United States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist demonstrations</a> against the religious discrimination of President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>'s Catholic regime escalated. Following the <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">raids on Buddhist pagodas</a> on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">coup</a> through a <a href="Cable%20243">cable</a> to <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20South%20Vietnam">US Ambassador</a> <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</a>

In their submissions to the NSC, Krulak presented an optimistic report on the progress of the war, while Mendenhall presented a bleak picture of military failure and public discontent. Krulak disregarded the popular support for the Viet Cong, feeling that the Vietnamese soldiers' efforts in the field would not be affected by the public's unease with Diệm's policies. Mendenhall focused on gauging the sentiment of urban Vietnamese and concluded that Diệm's policies increased the possibility of religious civil war, and were causing the South Vietnamese to believe that life under the Viet Cong would improve the quality of their lives. The divergent reports led US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> to ask his two advisers "You two did visit the same country, didn't you?"

The inconclusive report was the subject of bitter and personal debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various courses of action towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, Diệm's brother and chief political adviser. Nhu and his wife <a href="Madame%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Madame Ngô Đình Nhu</a> were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The inconclusive result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the <a href="McNamara%E2%80%93Taylor%20mission">McNamara–Taylor mission</a>.

After the <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF%20Ph%E1%BA%ADt%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3n%20shootings">Huế Phật Đản shootings</a> on May 8, civil unrest broke out in <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. Nine Buddhists were shot by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> regime of President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> after defying a government ban on the flying of <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a>s on <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a>, the birthday of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice for the families of the victims. With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The <a href="self-immolation">self-immolation</a> of Buddhist monk <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Thích Quảng Đức</a> at a busy <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Diệm's policies. As protests continued, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Special Forces</a> loyal to Diệm's brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a> conducted the <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">Xá Lợi Pagoda raids</a> on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumors of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the <a href="Vietnam%20War">insurgency</a>. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent <a href="Cable%20243">Cable 243</a> to the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a>, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.

At the end of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Security%20Council">National Security Council</a> (NSC) meeting on September 6, it was agreed that the priority was to obtain more information on the situation in Vietnam. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">US Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> proposed sending <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> Major General <a href="Victor%20Krulak">Victor Krulak</a> on an immediate fact-finding trip. The NSC agreed that <a href="Joseph%20Mendenhall">Joseph Mendenhall</a>—a Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience—would accompany him and the pair began the mission later that day.

On their return trip to Washington, D.C., Krulak and Mendenhall were to bring <a href="John%20Mecklin">John Mecklin</a> and <a href="Rufus%20Phillips">Rufus Phillips</a> back from Saigon to report. Mecklin was the <a href="United%20States%20Information%20Agency">United States Information Service</a> (USIS) director, while Phillips served as the director of rural programs for <a href="Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Operations Mission</a> (USOM) and as an advisor for the <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a>. The State Department sent the Saigon embassy a detailed cable containing questions about Vietnamese public opinion across all strata of society. In Krulak's words, the objective was to observe "the effect of recent events upon the attitudes of the Vietnamese in general, and upon the war effort against the Viet Cong".

In a four-day trip, the two men traveled throughout Vietnam before returning to Washington to file their reports. Krulak visited 10 locations in all four Corps zones of the ARVN and spoke with US Ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%2C%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</a>, the head of US forces in Vietnam General <a href="Paul%20Harkins">Paul Harkins</a> and his staff, 87 US advisors and 22 ARVN officers. Mendenhall went to Saigon, <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a>, <a href="Da%20Nang">Da Nang</a> and several other provincial cities, talking primarily to Vietnamese friends. Their estimates of the situation were the opposite. Mecklin wrote afterwards that it "was a remarkable assignment, to travel twenty-four thousand miles and assess a situation as complex as Vietnam and return in just four days. It was a symptom of the state the US Government was in". The mission was marked by the tension between its leaders. Mendenhall and Krulak intensely disliked one another, speaking to each other only when necessary. Mecklin and Krulak became embroiled in a dispute during the return flight. Krulak disapproved of Mecklin's decision to bring television footage that had been censored by the Diệm regime back to the US, believing the action was a violation of sovereignty. After a long and bitter argument aboard the aircraft, Krulak called upon Mecklin to leave the film in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> during a refueling stop at <a href="Elmendorf%20Air%20Force%20Base">Elmendorf Air Force Base</a>, further suggesting that the USIS director remain with the film in Alaska.

The NSC reconvened on the morning of September 10 to hear the delegation's reports. Mendenhall had experience in Vietnamese affairs, having served under the previous US Ambassador <a href="Elbridge%20Durbrow">Elbridge Durbrow</a>. Durbrow had urged Diệm on a number of occasions to implement political reform. Krulak was a marine known for his belief in using military action to achieve foreign affairs objectives. His temperament earned him the nickname "Brute", which originated from his wrestling career at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">Naval Academy</a>. The Deputy Secretary of Defense <a href="Roswell%20Gilpatric">Roswell Gilpatric</a> noted that Mendenhall was regarded "with great suspicion on the Virginia side of the <a href="Potomac%20River">river</a> [the Pentagon, headquarters of the Defense Department]", whereas Krulak was "universally liked and trusted in the Pentagon, both on the civilian and military side".

The backgrounds of Krulak and Mendenhall were reflected in their opposite analyses of the war. Krulak gave a highly optimistic analysis of military progress and discounted the effect of the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a> on the ARVN's fight against the Viet Cong. His conclusion was that "[t]he shooting war is still going ahead at an impressive pace. It has been affected adversely by the political crisis, but the impact is not great."
Krulak asserted that a substantial amount of fighting was still required, particularly in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, which was regarded as the Viet Cong's strongest region. Krulak asserted that all levels of the ARVN officer corps were conscious of the Buddhist crisis but he believed that most had not allowed religious beliefs to negatively affect their internal military relationships to a substantial degree. He believed that the ARVN officers were obedient and could be expected to carry out any order they regarded as lawful. Krulak further asserted that the political crisis had not significantly damaged bilateral military ties. Moving along to the Vietnamese view of their leaders, Krulak predicted that there was dissatisfaction among the officers, which he believed was mainly directed at <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, the younger brother of Diệm who was widely seen as the power behind the regime. Krulak believed that most officers wanted to see the back of Nhu but that few were willing to resort to a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a>. Krulak reported that three US advisers strongly criticized the Nhus and advocated the pair's departure from South Vietnam to avoid a public relations disaster at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. Krulak felt that these problems were outweighed by what he believed to be a successful military effort and that the war would be won irrespective of the political leadership. He predicted that the ARVN had little ability to facilitate an improvement in governance and felt that they would not flex whatever muscle they had. Krulak optimistically concluded,

Mendenhall disagreed and argued that the anti-Diệm sentiment had reached a level where the collapse of civilian rule was possible. He reported a "reign of terror" in Saigon, Huế and Da Nang, observing that the popular hatred usually reserved for the Nhus had spread to the generally respected Diệm. Mendenhall asserted that many Vietnamese had come to believe that life under Diệm worse than being ruled by the Viet Cong. Mendenhall thought that a civil war on religious grounds was possible. He predicted that the war could only be won with a regime change, otherwise South Vietnam would collapse into sectarian infighting or a massive communist offensive. The contradictory nature of the reports prompted Kennedy's famous query, "You two did visit the same country, didn't you?"

Krulak attempted to explain the contrasting assessments by pointing out that Mendenhall had surveyed urban areas, while he ventured into the countryside "where the war is". Krulak asserted that political issues in Saigon would not hamper military progress, stating "We can stagger through to win the war with Nhu remaining in control." Assistant Secretary of State <a href="Roger%20Hilsman">Roger Hilsman</a> asserted that the difference between the contrasting reports "was the difference between a military and a political view". During the debate over the differences in outlook, Mendenhall asserted that Saigon had suffered "a virtually complete breakdown" following the <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">pagoda raids</a>. Mendenhall reported that Vietnamese public servants feared being seen with Americans. He recalled one visit when he had to remain quiet while his Vietnamese host crept around the room, searching for hidden microphones. Mendenhall asserted that "Saigon was heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hate" and that the people feared Diệm more than the Viet Cong. He reported many public servants no longer slept at home due to a fear of midnight arrests by Nhu's <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a>. Many officials had recently spent the bulk of their day negotiating the release of their children, who had been incarcerated for participating in pro-Buddhist protests. Mendenhall asserted that internal turmoil was now a higher priority than the war against the communists.

Mendenhall denounced Saigon's reconciliation and goodwill gestures towards the Buddhists as a public relations stunt. He reported that <a href="bhikkhu">monks</a> from provincial areas who had been arrested in Saigon for demonstrating were not returned to their places of origin as promised. Mendenhall noted that when the monks were released, Diệm's officials retained their identification papers. This resulted in their re-arrest upon attempting to leave the capital. The monks were then branded as Viet Cong because they did not have government identification papers. As news of such tactics spread across the capital, some monks sought refuge in the Saigon homes of ARVN officers. Mendenhall insisted that the United States was responsible for the situation because it had helped the Ngo family gain power, armed and funded it. He reasoned that as Diệm used the arms against his own people, Washington also shared responsibility. He stated that "a refusal to act would be just as much interference in Vietnam's affairs as acting".
According to the "<a href="Pentagon%20Papers">Pentagon Papers</a>", "the critical failure of both reports was to understand the fundamental political role that the army was coming to play in Vietnam". The papers concluded the ARVN was the only institution capable of deposing and replacing Diệm. Diệm and Nhu fully realized the potential threat, responding with the <a href="Divide%20and%20rule">divide and conquer</a> paradigm. They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion and appointed generals based on loyalty to the palace, giving orders directly to officers. This action caused deep distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their power. Krulak failed to realize that if the situation deteriorated to the point where discontent with Diệm posed the possibility of a communist victory, the generals would intervene in politics because of what would happen to them under communist rule. Neither Krulak nor Mendenhall seemed to anticipate that if a military junta came to power, the divisive effect of Diệm's promotion politics would manifest itself as the generals vied for power. Neither of the pair put any emphasis on the detrimental effects that would have been caused by political infighting among the generals.

During the NSC meeting, <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a> – who preceded Lodge as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20South%20Vietnam">US Ambassador to South Vietnam</a> – took issue with Mendenhall's analysis. Regarded as a Diệm <a href="Apologetics">apologist</a>, Nolting pointed out that Mendenhall had been pessimistic about South Vietnam for several years. Mecklin reinforced and pushed Mendenhall's view further, calling on the administration to apply direct pressure on Saigon by suspending non-military aid, in an attempt to cause a regime change. In Mecklin's words:

The "Pentagon Papers" opined that Mecklin understood the pitfalls of a <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a> that Krulak and Mendenhall had overlooked. Regardless, Mecklin concluded that the US should proceed in fostering a regime change, accept the consequences, and contemplate the introduction of US combat troops to stop a possible Viet Cong victory.

The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak prognosis of the situation in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">Strategic Hamlet Program</a> was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but I have to tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." Phillips asserted that removing Nhu was the only way to improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed. Phillips recommended three measures:


In the ensuing debate, Kennedy asked Phillips what would happen if Nhu responded to the cuts by diverting money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.

The meeting became confrontational when Krulak interrupted Phillips, asserting that American military advisers on the ground rejected the USOM officer's assessments. Phillips conceded that although the overall military situation had improved, this was not the case in the crucial delta areas. Phillips noted that the provincial military adviser in <a href="Long%20An%20Province">Long An Province</a> adjacent to Saigon, had reported that the Viet Cong had overrun 200 Strategic Hamlets in the previous week, forcing the villagers to dismantle the settlement. McNamara shook his head at the radically divergent reports. When Krulak derided Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State <a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a> could no longer restrain himself and called the general "a damn fool". Phillips diplomatically took over from Harriman and asserted that it was a battle for hearts and minds rather than pure military metrics.

Mecklin generated more disquiet by advocating the use of American combat troops to unseat the Diệm regime and win the war. He asserted that "the time had come for the US to apply direct pressure to bring about a change of government, however distasteful". Mecklin asserted that there would be a backlash if aid was simply cut, so US troops would have to directly fix the problem. Mecklin later wrote to USIS head Edward R. Murrow to insist that US troops would welcome combat in the case of a communist escalation. On the journey back to the United States, he had asserted that the use of American combat forces would encourage the coup and lift morale against the Viet Cong. He also called for the engineering of a coup. He called for the US to show more intent.

The pessimism expressed by Phillips and Mecklin surprised <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a>, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account "surprised the hell out of me. I couldn't believe my ears." Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed because he had recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a> and <a href="Neil%20Sheehan">Neil Sheehan</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and <a href="UPI">UPI</a> respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>s and were strident critics of Diệm.

One strategy that received increasing consideration in NSC meetings—as well as at the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a> and in <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>—was a suspension of non-military aid to Diệm. After the erroneous <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> broadcast on August 26, which announced an aid suspension, Lodge was given the discretion on August 29 to suspend aid if it would facilitate a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">coup</a>. In the meantime, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">US Senate</a> began to pressure the administration to take action against Diệm. Hilsman was lobbied by the Senate Subcommittee on the Far East. Senator <a href="Frank%20Church">Frank Church</a> informed the administration of his intention to introduce a resolution condemning Diệm's anti-Buddhist repression and calling for the termination of aid unless religious equality was instituted. This resulted in Church agreeing to temporarily delay the introduction of the bill to avoid embarrassing the administration.

While the delegation was in Vietnam, the strategy of using a selective aid suspension to pressure Diệm into ending religious discrimination was actively discussed at the State Department. In a television interview on September 8, <a href="USAID">AID</a> Director David Bell warned that Congress might cut aid to South Vietnam if Diệm did not change his policies. On September 9, Kennedy backed away from Bell's comments, stating "I don't think we think that [a reduction in aid to Saigon] would be helpful at this time." On September 11, the day after Krulak and Mendenhall tabled their reports, Lodge reversed his position. In a long cable to Washington, he advocated the consideration of using non-military aid suspension to spark the toppling of Diệm. Lodge concluded that the US could not get what it wanted from Diệm, and had to force events to come to a head. After another White House meeting on the same day, Senator Church was informed that his bill was acceptable, so he introduced the legislation into the Senate.

The National Security Council re-convened on September 17 to consider two of Hilsman's proposals for dealing with Diệm. The plan favored by Hilsman and his State Department colleagues was the "pressures and persuasion track". This involved an escalating series of measures at both public and private level, including selective aid suspension and pressuring Diệm to remove Nhu from power. The alternative was the "reconciliation with a rehabilitated GVN track", which involved the public appearance of acquiescence to Diệm's recent actions and an attempt to salvage as much as possible from the situation. Both proposals assumed that an ARVN coup was not forthcoming. The inconclusive report saw a follow-up mission sent to Vietnam, the <a href="McNamara%E2%80%93Taylor%20mission">McNamara–Taylor mission</a>, led by Defense Secretary <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> and <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> <a href="Maxwell%20D.%20Taylor">Maxwell D. Taylor</a>.

Whitechapel murders

The Whitechapel murders were committed in or near the impoverished <a href="Whitechapel%20District%20%28Metropolis%29">Whitechapel district</a> in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891. At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> known as <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>.

A number of the victims—<a href="Emma%20Elizabeth%20Smith">Emma Elizabeth Smith</a>, <a href="Martha%20Tabram">Martha Tabram</a>, <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann "Polly" Nichols</a>, <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a>, <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a>, <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a>, Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an <a href="Whitehall%20Mystery">unidentified woman</a>—were prostitutes. Smith was <a href="sexual%20assault">sexually assaulted</a> and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were killed on the same night, minutes and less than a mile apart; their murders were nicknamed the "double event", after a phrase in a <a href="Saucy%20Jacky%20postcard">postcard sent to the press by someone claiming to be the Ripper</a>. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal mutilations. Mylett was strangled. The body of the unidentified woman was dismembered, but the exact cause of her death is unclear.

The <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>, <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a>, and private organisations such as the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> were involved in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.

In the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal <a href="Rookery%20%28slum%29">rookery</a> in London. The area around <a href="Flower%20and%20Dean%20Street">Flower and Dean Street</a> was described as "perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis"; <a href="Dorset%20Street%2C%20London">Dorset Street</a> was called "the worst street in London". Assistant Police Commissioner <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28police%20official%29">Robert Anderson</a> recommended Whitechapel to "those who take an interest in the dangerous classes" as one of London's prime criminal "show places". Robbery and violence were commonplace. The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the <a href="common%20lodging-house">common lodging-house</a>, which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered. All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in <a href="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</a>, including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.

Police work and criminal prosecutions relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. <a href="Forensic%20science">Forensic techniques</a>, such as <a href="fingerprint">fingerprint</a> analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9 km) of the city centre. The <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the <a href="Corporation%20of%20London">Corporation of London</a>. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.

Eleven deaths in or near Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891 were gathered into a single file, referred to in the police docket as the Whitechapel murders. Much of the original material has been either stolen or destroyed.

On Tuesday 3 April 1888, following the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute <a href="Emma%20Elizabeth%20Smith">Emma Elizabeth Smith</a> was assaulted and robbed at the junction of <a href="Osborn%20Street">Osborn Street</a> and <a href="Brick%20Lane">Brick Lane</a>, Whitechapel, in the early hours of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the <a href="London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a>, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her <a href="peritoneum">peritoneum</a>. She developed <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> and died at 9 am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the <a href="coroner">coroner</a> for East <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, <a href="Wynne%20Edwin%20Baxter">Wynne Edwin Baxter</a>, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, <a href="Edmund%20Reid">Edmund Reid</a> of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. <a href="Walter%20Dew">Walter Dew</a>, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.

On Tuesday 7 August, following a Monday bank holiday, prostitute <a href="Martha%20Tabram">Martha Tabram</a> was murdered at about 2:30 am. Her body was found at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39 times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and <a href="Wellington%20Barracks">Wellington Barracks</a> on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.

On Friday 31 August, prostitute <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a> was murdered in <a href="Durward%20Street">Buck's Row</a> (since renamed Durward Street), a back street in Whitechapel. Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45 am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards. As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a> Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, <a href="James%20Monro">James Monro</a> resigned as the head of the <a href="Criminal%20Investigation%20Department">Criminal Investigation Department</a> (CID) over differences with <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police</a> Sir <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a>. Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith. "<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>" newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline. Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors <a href="Frederick%20Abberline">Frederick Abberline</a>, <a href="Henry%20Moore%20%28police%20officer%29">Henry Moore</a> and <a href="Walter%20Simon%20Andrews">Walter Andrews</a> from the Central Office at <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>. On the available evidence, <a href="Wynne%20Edwin%20Baxter">Coroner Baxter</a> concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3 am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat. However, by the time the inquest into Nichols' death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted "The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable."

The mutilated body of the fourth woman, prostitute <a href="Annie%20Chapman">Annie Chapman</a>, was discovered at about 6:00 am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 <a href="Hanbury%20Street">Hanbury Street</a>, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2 am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, <a href="George%20Bagster%20Phillips">George Bagster Phillips</a>, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.

On 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called <a href="John%20Pizer">John Pizer</a>, dubbed "Leather Apron", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes. His alibis for the two most recent murders were corroborated, and he was released without charge. At the inquest one of the witnesses, Mrs Elizabeth Long, testified that she had seen Chapman talking to a man at about 5:30 am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, where Chapman was later found. Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, "shabby-genteel" appearance. He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat. Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence.

In his memoirs, <a href="Walter%20Dew">Walter Dew</a> recorded that the killings caused widespread panic in London. A mob attacked the <a href="Commercial%20Road">Commercial Road</a> police station, suspecting that the murderer was being held there. <a href="Samuel%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Baron%20Swaythling">Samuel Montagu</a>, the Member of Parliament for <a href="Whitechapel%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Whitechapel</a>, offered a reward of £100 (roughly £ as of 2019) after rumours that the attacks were <a href="Blood%20libel">Jewish ritual killings</a> led to <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> demonstrations. Local residents founded the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> under the chairmanship of <a href="George%20Lusk">George Lusk</a> and offered a reward for the apprehension of the killer—something the Metropolitan Police (under instruction from the Home Office) refused to do because it could lead to false or misleading information. The Committee employed two private detectives to investigate the case.

<a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28police%20official%29">Robert Anderson</a> was appointed head of the CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent <a href="Thomas%20Arnold%20%28police%20officer%29">Thomas Arnold</a>, who was in charge of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Chief Commissioner</a> Sir <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a> to appoint Chief Inspector <a href="Donald%20Swanson">Donald Swanson</a> to co-ordinate the investigation from <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.

On Sunday 30 September, the body of prostitute <a href="Elizabeth%20Stride">Elizabeth Stride</a> was discovered at about 1 am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of <a href="Whitechapel%20Road">Whitechapel Road</a>, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of <a href="Catherine%20Eddowes">Catherine Eddowes</a> on the same night.

At 1:45 am Catherine Eddowes' mutilated body was found by PC Edward Watkins at the south-west corner of <a href="Mitre%20Square">Mitre Square</a>, in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street. She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat from left to right with a sharp, pointed knife at least 6 inches (15 cm) long. Her face and abdomen were mutilated, and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between her torso and left arm. Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed. The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London. The examining pathologist, Dr Frederick Gordon Brown, believed the perpetrator "had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs" and from the position of the wounds on the body he could tell that the murderer had knelt to the right of the body, and worked alone. However, the first doctor at the scene, local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs. His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy. Because of this murder's location, the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry.

At 3 am a blood-stained fragment of Eddowes' apron was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to 108 to 119 Goulston Street, Whitechapel, about a third of a mile (500 m) from the murder scene. There was <a href="Goulston%20Street%20graffito">chalk writing on the wall of the doorway</a>, which read either "The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing" or "The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing." At 5 am, Commissioner Warren attended the scene and ordered the words erased for fear that they would spark <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> riots. Goulston Street was on a direct route from Mitre Square to Flower and Dean Street, where both Stride and Eddowes lived.

The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, believed that Stride had been attacked with a swift, sudden action. She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath freshening sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating that she had not had time to defend herself. A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious. At the inquest, the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes. They described her stomach contents as "cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [flour or milled grain]". Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press. Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed. <a href="Joseph%20Lawende">Joseph Lawende</a> passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache. Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer. However, Lawende stated that he would not be able to identify the man again, and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions.

Criticism of the Metropolitan Police and the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Henry%20Matthews%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Llandaff">Henry Matthews</a>, continued to mount as little progress was made with the investigation. The City Police and the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> offered a reward of £500 (roughly £ as of 2019) for information leading to the capture of the villain. The use of <a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a>s to track the killer in the event of another attack was considered and a trial was held in London but the idea was abandoned because the trail of scents was confused in the busy city, the dogs were inexperienced in an urban environment, and the owner Edwin Brough of Wyndyate near Scarborough (now <a href="Scalby%20Manor%2C%20Scarborough">Scalby Manor</a>) was concerned that the dogs would be poisoned by criminals if their role in crime detection became known.

On 27 September, the <a href="Central%20News%20Agency%20%28London%29">Central News Agency</a> received <a href="Dear%20Boss%20letter">a letter, dubbed the "Dear Boss" letter</a>, in which the writer, who signed himself "Jack the Ripper", claimed to have committed the murders. On 1 October, <a href="Saucy%20Jacky%20postcard">a postcard, dubbed the "Saucy Jacky" postcard</a> and also signed "Jack the Ripper", was received by the agency. It claimed responsibility for the most recent murders on 30 September, and described the murders of the two women as the "double event", a designation which has endured.

On Tuesday 2 October, an unidentified female torso was found in the basement of <a href="Norman%20Shaw%20Buildings">New Scotland Yard</a>, which was under construction. It was linked to the Whitechapel murders by the press, but it was not included in the Whitechapel murders file, and any connection between the two is now considered unlikely. The case became known as the <a href="Whitehall%20Mystery">Whitehall Mystery</a>. On the same day, the psychic <a href="Robert%20James%20Lees">Robert James Lees</a> visited Scotland Yard and offered to track down the murderer using paranormal powers; the police turned him away and "called [him] a fool and a lunatic".

The head of the <a href="Criminal%20Investigation%20Department">CID</a>, Anderson, eventually got back from leave on 6 October and took charge of the investigation for Scotland Yard. On 16 October, <a href="George%20Lusk">George Lusk</a> of the <a href="Whitechapel%20Vigilance%20Committee">Whitechapel Vigilance Committee</a> received <a href="From%20Hell%20letter">another letter claiming to be from the killer</a>. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the "Dear Boss" letter and "Saucy Jacky" postcard. The letter arrived with a small box containing half of a human kidney preserved in alcohol. The letter's writer claimed that he had extracted it from the body of Eddowes and that he had "fried and ate" the missing half. Opinion on whether the kidney and the letter were genuine was and is divided. By the end of October, the police had interviewed more than 2,000 people, investigated "upwards of 300", and detained 80.

On Friday 9 November, prostitute <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Kelly">Mary Jane Kelly</a> was murdered in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 <a href="Dorset%20Street%2C%20London">Dorset Street, Spitalfields</a>. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was reported to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45 am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr <a href="George%20Bagster%20Phillips">George Bagster Phillips</a>, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.

The coroner for North East Middlesex, Dr <a href="Roderick%20Macdonald%20%28politician%29">Roderick Macdonald</a>, MP, presided over the inquest into Kelly's death at <a href="Shoreditch%20Town%20Hall">Shoreditch Town Hall</a> on 12 November. Amid scenes of great emotion, an "enormous crowd" of mourners attended Mary Kelly's funeral on 19 November. The streets became gridlocked and the cortège struggled to travel from Shoreditch mortuary to the Roman Catholic Cemetery at <a href="Leytonstone">Leytonstone</a>, where she was laid to rest.

On 8 November, <a href="Charles%20Warren">Charles Warren</a> resigned as <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police</a> after the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> informed him that he could not make public statements without Home Office approval. <a href="James%20Monro">James Monro</a>, who had resigned a few months earlier over differences with Warren, was appointed as his replacement in December. On 10 November, the police surgeon <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28British%20physician%29">Thomas Bond</a> wrote to <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28police%20official%29">Robert Anderson</a>, head of the London CID, detailing the similarities between the five murders of Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes and Kelly, "no doubt committed by the same hand". On the same day, the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> resolved to offer a pardon to any accomplice who came forward with information that led to the conviction of the actual murderer. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that the Whitechapel murderer remained unidentified despite 143 extra plain-clothes policemen deployed in Whitechapel in November and December.

On Thursday 20 December 1888, a patrolling constable found prostitute Rose Mylett (also known as Catherine Millett and Lizzie Davis), 29, strangled in Clarke's Yard, off <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a> High Street. Mylett had lodged at 18 George Street, as had Emma Smith. Four doctors who examined Mylett's body thought she had been murdered, but Robert Anderson thought she had accidentally hanged herself on the collar of her dress while in a drunken stupor. At Anderson's request Dr Bond examined Mylett's body, and he agreed with Anderson. Commissioner Monro also suspected it was a suicide or natural death as there were no signs of a struggle. The coroner, Wynne Baxter, told the inquest jury that "there is no evidence to show that death was the result of violence". Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of "wilful murder against some person or persons unknown" and the case was added to the Whitechapel file.

Alice McKenzie was possibly a prostitute, and was murdered at about 12:40 am on Wednesday 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. Like most of the previous murders, her left carotid artery was severed from left to right and there were wounds on her abdomen. However, her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders, and a shorter blade was used. Commissioner Monro and one of the pathologists examining the body, Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another of the pathologists, Phillips, and Robert Anderson disagreed, as did Inspector Abberline. Later writers are also divided, and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim, or that the unknown murderer tried to make it look like a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself. At the inquest, Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities, and concluded: "There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases, which have happened in this neighbourhood, and if the same person has not committed this crime, it is clearly an imitation of the other cases."

A woman's torso was found at 5:15 a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel. No other body parts were found, despite a search of the area, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified. <a href="Donald%20Swanson">Chief Inspector Swanson</a> and <a href="James%20Monro">Commissioner Monro</a> noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat. The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death. Newspaper speculation that the body belonged to Lydia Hart, who had disappeared, was refuted after she was found recovering in hospital after "a bit of a spree". Another claim that the victim was a missing girl called Emily Barker was also refuted, as the torso was from an older and taller woman. The age of the victim was estimated at 30–40 years.

Swanson did not consider this a Ripper case, and instead suggested a link to <a href="Thames%20Torso%20Murders%20of%201887-89">similar dismembered body cases</a> in <a href="Rainham%2C%20London">Rainham</a> and <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, as well as the "<a href="Whitehall%20Mystery">Whitehall Mystery</a>". Monro agreed with Swanson's assessment. These three murders and the Pinchin Street case are suggested to be the work of a serial killer, nicknamed the "Torso killer", who could either be the same person as "Jack the Ripper" or a separate killer of uncertain connection. Links between these and three further murders—the "<a href="Battersea%20Mystery">Battersea Mystery</a>" of 1873 and 1874, in which two women were found dismembered, and the 1884 "<a href="Tottenham%20Court%20Road%20Mystery">Tottenham Court Road Mystery</a>"—have also been postulated. Experts on the murders—colloquially known as "Ripperologists"—such as Stewart Evans, <a href="Keith%20Skinner">Keith Skinner</a>, <a href="Martin%20Fido">Martin Fido</a>, and <a href="Donald%20Rumbelow">Donald Rumbelow</a>, discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings on the basis of their different "<a href="modi%20operandi">modi operandi</a>".

Monro was replaced as Commissioner by Sir <a href="Sir%20Edward%20Bradford%2C%201st%20Baronet">Edward Bradford</a> on 21 June 1890, after a disagreement with <a href="Henry%20Matthews%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Llandaff">Home Secretary Matthews</a> over police pensions.

The last of the murders in the Whitechapel file was committed on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15 am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds on the back of her head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, from left to right and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. <a href="Thomas%20Arnold%20%28policeman%29">Superintendent Arnold</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Reid">Inspector Reid</a> arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors <a href="Donald%20Swanson">Donald Swanson</a> and <a href="Henry%20Moore%20%28policeman%29">Henry Moore</a>, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5 am. A man named <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20suspects%23James%20Thomas%20Sadler">James Sadler</a>, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts at the time of the previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.

Abberline retired in 1892, and Matthews lost office in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201892">that year's general election</a>. Arnold retired the following year, and Swanson and Anderson retired after 1900. There are no documents in the Whitechapel murder file dated after 1896. The murderer or murderers were never identified and the cases remain unsolved. Sensational reportage and the mystery surrounding the identity of the killer or killers fed the development of the character "<a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>", who was blamed for all or most of the murders. Hundreds of books and articles discuss the Whitechapel murders, and they feature in <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper%20in%20fiction">novels, short stories, comic books, television shows, and films</a> of multiple genres.

The poor of the East End had long been ignored by affluent society, but the nature of the murders and of the victims drew attention to their living conditions. The murders galvanised opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums of the East End, and led to demands for reform. On 24 September 1888, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> commented sarcastically on the media's sudden concern with <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> in a letter to "<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>" newspaper:

Acts of Parliament, such as the <a href="Housing%20of%20the%20Working%20Classes%20Act%201890">Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890</a> and the Public Health Amendment Act 1890, set minimum standards for accommodation in an effort to transform degenerated urban areas. The worst of the slums were demolished in the two decades following the Whitechapel murders.

Paterson Clarence Hughes, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (19 September 1917 – 7 September 1940) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of World War II. Serving with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF), he was credited with as many as seventeen aerial victories during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, before being killed in action on 7 September 1940. His tally made him the highest-scoring Australian of the battle, and among the three highest-scoring Australians of the war.

Born in <a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a>, New South Wales, Hughes joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a cadet in 1936. After graduating as a pilot, he chose to take a commission with the RAF. In July 1937, he was assigned to <a href="No.%2064%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 64 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> and, later, <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> fighters. Posted to <a href="No.%20234%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 234 Squadron</a> following the outbreak of World War II, Hughes began flying <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s as a <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a>. He shared in his unit's first aerial victory on 8 July 1940, and began scoring heavily against the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" the following month. Known for his practice of attacking his targets at extremely close range, Hughes is generally thought to have died after his Spitfire was struck by flying debris from a German bomber that he had just shot down. He was posthumously awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, and was buried in England.

Paterson Clarence Hughes was born in Numeralla, near <a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a>, New South Wales, on 19 September 1917. He was the second-youngest of twelve children, the last of four boys in his family. Hughes' father was a teacher by profession but at the time of Pat's birth was running the community post office; christened Percival Clarence Hughes, and known as Percy, he had apparently adopted the name Paterson by the time of his marriage to Catherine Vennell in 1895. Percy was also a writer, contributing to newspapers and magazines such as "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>", and "Paterson" may have been homage to the poet <a href="Banjo%20Paterson">Banjo Paterson</a>. In any case, Pat shared his father's interest in literature. He also grew to love the landscape of the local <a href="Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Monaro district</a> in the shadow of the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains">Snowy Mountains</a>, which he described as "unrivalled in the magnificence and grandeur of its beauty".
Hughes was educated at Cooma Public School until the age of twelve, when the family moved to <a href="Haberfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Haberfield</a> in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>; his father was by then working as a labourer. He attended <a href="Petersham%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Petersham Boys' School</a>, becoming a <a href="school%20prefect">prefect</a> in 1932 and vice captain the following year. As well as playing sport, he was a keen aircraft modeller and built <a href="crystal%20radio">crystal radio</a> sets. Having attained his <a href="Intermediate%20Certificate%20%28Australia%29">intermediate certificate</a>, Hughes entered <a href="Fort%20Street%20High%20School">Fort Street High School</a> in February 1934. He left after eight months to take up employment at Saunders' Jewellers in <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street, Sydney</a>, and enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) on 20 January 1936. Hughes had also applied to, and been accepted by, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, but chose the RAAF.

Training as an air cadet at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a> near <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Hughes learnt to fly in <a href="de%20Havilland%20Moth">de Havilland Moth</a>s before progressing to <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s in the middle of the year. A practical joker who bridled under RAAF discipline, his euphoria during his first solo on 11 March 1936 was such that he "went mad, whistled, sang and almost jumped for joy". A fellow cadet recalled that Hughes "loved life and lived it at high pressure". Upon graduation in December 1936, Hughes was assessed as having "no outstanding qualities" despite being "energetic and keen". Under a pre-war arrangement between the British and Australian governments, he volunteered for transfer to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF), and sailed for the United Kingdom in January 1937. His decision to transfer had not been quick or easy; though keen to "try and do something special" in England, and intrigued by "a fascinating picture of easy life, beer and women" that had been presented to him, in the end he felt that it was simply "willed" that he should go.

On 20 March 1937, Hughes was granted a five-year short-service commission as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in the RAF. Like some of his compatriots, he refused to exchange his dark-blue RAAF uniform for the lighter-coloured RAF one. He undertook advanced flying instruction at <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAF">No. 2 Flying Training School</a> in <a href="Digby%2C%20Lincolnshire">Digby</a>, Lincolnshire. Slated to fly bombers, he appealed and in July was posted as a fighter pilot to <a href="No.%2064%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 64 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s out of <a href="RAF%20Martlesham%20Heath">RAF Martlesham Heath</a>, Suffolk. The squadron was transferred to <a href="RAF%20Church%20Fenton">RAF Church Fenton</a>, Yorkshire, in May 1938. Hughes was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 19 November. No. 64 Squadron subsequently received <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim 1F</a> twin-engined fighters, and completed its conversion to the type in January 1939.
Hughes was promoted to acting <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in November 1939 and became a <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a> in the newly formed <a href="No.%20234%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 234 Squadron</a>, which, like No. 64 Squadron, came under the control of <a href="No.%2013%20Group%20RAF">No. 13 Group</a> in the north of England. On establishment the previous month at <a href="RAF%20Leconfield">RAF Leconfield</a>, East Yorkshire, No. 234 Squadron was equipped with Blenheims, <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a>s and <a href="Gloster%20Gauntlet">Gloster Gauntlet</a>s; it began re-arming with <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s in March 1940 and was operational two months later. The commanding officer, <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Richard Barnett, rarely flew, and Hughes assumed responsibility for overseeing conversion to the Spitfire. "More experienced and more mature" than his fellow pilots, according to historian <a href="Stephen%20Bungay">Stephen Bungay</a>, the Australian "effectively led" No. 234 Squadron. By this time, Hughes had acquired a young <a href="Airedale%20Terrier">Airedale Terrier</a> known as Flying Officer Butch, who sometimes flew with him—against regulations. He had also met and begun dating Kathleen ("Kay") Brodrick of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On 19 June, Hughes and his squadron transferred to <a href="RAF%20St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BEval">RAF St Eval</a>, Cornwall, under the jurisdiction of the newly formed <a href="No.%2010%20Group%20RAF">No. 10 Group</a> in south-west England.

As the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> got under way in July 1940, Hughes shared in No. 234 Squadron's first confirmed aerial victories. He and his section of two other Spitfires shot down a German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B88">Junkers Ju 88</a> attacking convoys near <a href="Lands%20End">Lands End</a> on 8 July, and another south-east of <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> during a dawn patrol on 28 July. A shared claim for a Ju 88 on 27 July could not be confirmed as destroyed; after a chase over the water at heights as low as , the German escaped, despite being struck in the engines and cockpit, and was credited to the section as "damaged". German records, made available post-war, confirm that a Junkers 88A piloted by Leutnant Ruckdeschel, was lost on this day. On 1 August, Hughes was seconded from No. 234 Squadron to help set up the only <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a>-equipped unit to operate during the Battle of Britain, <a href="No.%20247%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 247 (China British) Squadron</a> in Plymouth. The same day, he married Kay Brodrick, who likened him to <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>, in the <a href="register%20office">register office</a> at <a href="Bodmin">Bodmin</a>, Cornwall. Apart from Flying Officer Butch, the witnesses were strangers; Kay arrived alone, and no-one from No. 234 Squadron could attend. Barnett was transferred out of No. 234 Squadron on 13 August, and Hughes took temporary command until the arrival of Squadron Leader Joe "Spike" O'Brien four days later. By now the fighting was intensifying over southern England, and the squadron relocated from St Eval to <a href="RAF%20Middle%20Wallop">RAF Middle Wallop</a>, Hampshire, on 14 August. Almost immediately after Hughes landed the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" bombed the airfield; several ground staff and civilian workers were killed, but No. 234 Squadron's Spitfires escaped damage.
It was following No. 234 Squadron's move to Middle Wallop that Hughes began to score heavily against German fighters. On 15 August, in one of the costliest engagements of the Battle of Britain, known thereafter to the "Luftwaffe" as "Black Thursday", Hughes claimed victories (one of them shared) over two <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a>s. He again achieved dual success on 16, 18 and 26 August, all six victims being <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>s brought down in the vicinity of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Whereas in July he had fired at his targets from a range of , it was now his habit to close to , approximately three Spitfire lengths, before delivering his final burst; he also made head-on attacks against enemy aircraft. He had a narrow escape on the 16th after his second victory of the day, when he chased a quartet of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B87">Junkers Ju 87</a>s and had his <a href="tailplane">tailplane</a> shot up from behind by another Bf 109; he dived and forced the German to overshoot, then broke off having exhausted his ammunition firing at his former attacker. In the pub with Kay and his squadron mates that evening, Hughes jokingly told his wife, "In case of accidents make sure you marry again".
On 3 September, Hughes' promotion to <a href="substantive%20rank">substantive</a> flight lieutenant was promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>". He claimed three Me 110s in the space of fifteen minutes south of <a href="Haslemere">Haslemere</a> on 4 September, two Bf 109s while patrolling <a href="Kenley">Kenley</a> the following day, and a Bf 109 destroyed plus one probable near <a href="Dover">Dover</a> on 6 September; he had to break off combat with the last-mentioned when its tanks ruptured, covering Hughes' canopy in oil. One of his victims on 5 September may have been Oberleutnant <a href="Franz%20von%20Werra">Franz von Werra</a>, who was captured and subsequently became famous as "<a href="the%20One%20That%20Got%20Away%20%281957%20film%29">the one that got away</a>". Hughes and his protégé, <a href="Bob%20Doe">Bob Doe</a>, claimed half of No. 234 Squadron's victories between mid-August and early September.

Hughes was killed in action on the evening of 7 September 1940, after he intercepted a <a href="Dornier%20Do%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B17">Dornier Do 17</a> bomber taking part in a large-scale attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between <a href="Sundridge%2C%20Kent">Sundridge</a> and <a href="Bessels%20Green">Bessels Green</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the <a href="River%20Darent">River Darent</a>. No. 234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part in it. The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf 109. Some observers on the ground, including <a href="Coal%20mining">collier</a> Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose. Four days after his death, No. 234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.

The top-scoring Australian <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> of the Battle of Britain and one of fourteen Australian fighter pilots killed during the battle, Hughes has been described as "the inspiration and driving force behind No. 234 Squadron RAF". He is generally credited with seventeen confirmed victories—fourteen solo and three shared. This tally puts him among the top ten <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> Battle of Britain aces. It also ranks him among the three highest-scoring Australians of World War II, after <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a> with thirty victories (twenty-seven solo and three shared) and <a href="Adrian%20Goldsmith">Adrian Goldsmith</a> with seventeen (sixteen solo and one shared).

A war widow after barely five weeks of marriage, Kay Hughes was inconsolable in her loss: "I wept until I could cry no more". Flying Officer Butch ran out of the <a href="mess">mess</a> on the day of his master's death, and was never seen again. Following a service at St James', <a href="Sutton-on-Hull">Sutton-on-Hull</a>, on 13 September 1940, Hughes was buried in the churchyard at Row G, Grave 4. A week later, Kay discovered she was pregnant, but eventually miscarried. She subsequently drove ambulances for the British war effort. News of his son's marriage came as "a complete surprise" to Percy Hughes, who only learned of his daughter-in-law's existence from the Australian Air Board's casualty letter. Having married three more times after Hughes' death, Kay died on 28 June 1983 and, in accordance with her wishes, her ashes were buried with her first husband, whose headstone was amended to read "In loving memory of his wife Kathleen".

Hughes was posthumously awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) on 22 October 1940 for his "skill and determination" as a flight commander and "gallantry in his attacks on the enemy"; Squadron Leader O'Brien had recommended the decoration a week before their deaths. Kay was presented with the medal at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 23 June 1942. In Australia, Hughes is commemorated at Christ's Church, <a href="Kiama">Kiama</a>, with a memorial tablet placed by his sister Muriel. A special memorial is dedicated to him at Monaghan Hayes Place, Cooma. His name appears on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Roll%20of%20Honour">Battle of Britain Roll of Honour</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, and on supplementary panel 12 in the Commemorative Area of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (AWM), <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. The AWM also holds his DFC and service medals in its collection. Kay had given the medals to her sisters-in-law to pass on to Percy in the 1950s and, after being lost during an <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> parade in the 1960s, they went through several family members' hands before turning up in the safe of the Kiama <a href="Country%20Women%27s%20Association">Country Women's Association</a>; they were donated to the AWM in 1990. On 7 September 2005, Charles Hall's sons dedicated a plaque in Hughes' honour at the house where he fell in Main Road, Sundridge; Bob Doe attended, expressing his thanks for "an Australian who came to help us when we needed him". <a href="Shoreham%20Aircraft%20Museum">Shoreham Aircraft Museum</a> in Kent unveiled a memorial stone to Hughes at Sundridge on 23 August 2008. On 15 September 2014, the AWM's daily <a href="Last%20Post">Last Post Ceremony</a> was dedicated to Hughes' memory.

James Moore (Continental Army officer)

James Moore ( 1737 – April 15, 1777) was a <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> general during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Born into a prominent political <a href="Moore%20family%20%28Carolinas%29">family</a> in the colonial <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">Province of North Carolina</a>, he was one of only five generals from North Carolina to serve in the Continental Army. Moore spent much of his childhood and youth on his family's estates in the lower <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a> area, but soon became active in the colonial military structure in North Carolina.

Moore served in the colonial <a href="Militia%20%28United%20States%29%23History">militia</a> during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, and commanded the colonial governor's artillery at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alamance">Battle of Alamance</a>, which ended the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Regulation">War of the Regulation</a>. In addition to his military involvement, he was active in the <a href="American%20Revolution">independence movement</a>, despite having been a supporter of the colonial government during his early career. Moore played a prominent role in the local <a href="Sons%20of%20Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> organizations, and assisted in organizing the colony-wide extra-legal <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">Provincial Congress</a>. In 1775, he was elected the first commander of a Continental Line regiment in North Carolina, which had been raised following the instructions of the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a>.

After distinguishing himself in the campaign that led to the <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moore%27s%20Creek%20Bridge">Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge</a>, and the battle's aftermath on February 27, 1776, Moore was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army. He maintained his headquarters in North Carolina during early 1776 to thwart a threatened <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> invasion of the state but, in the latter part of the year, received orders to move his command to <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. Moore briefly held "de facto" command of the <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Southern Department</a> before his death due to illness in April 1777. He is remembered as a competent military commander whose early death ended a promising career.

James Moore was born in <a href="New%20Hanover%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Hanover Precinct</a> in the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20%28region%29">Cape Fear</a> region of the Carolinas in about 1737. His family had extensive landholdings at Rocky Point, located at a bend in the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a> about north of <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a>. He was the son of Maurice Moore and his second wife, Mary Porter. His older brother, also named Maurice Moore, would go on to become a Patriot political leader in North Carolina during the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. His sister, Rebecca Moore, would marry a Revolutionary War leader, <a href="Militia%20%28United%20States%29%23History">militia</a> General <a href="John%20Ashe%20%28general%29">John Ashe</a>.

Moore was, through his father's side, a grandson of Governor <a href="James%20Moore%20%28South%20Carolina%20politician%29">James Moore</a>, who was governor of the <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Province of Carolina</a> when North and South Carolina were a single colony. Maurice Moore had championed settlement of the Cape Fear region under Governor <a href="George%20Burrington">George Burrington</a>. Additionally, Moore's uncle, Colonel James Moore, was a military leader during the <a href="Yamasee%20War">Yamasee War</a>. Moore's nephew, <a href="Alfred%20Moore">Alfred Moore</a>, served in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> under Moore's command and would go on to become an Associate Justice of the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a>. Moore's niece, Mary, would later marry Moore's Continental Army colleague <a href="Francis%20Nash">Francis Nash</a>.

Moore's extended relatives constituted the single most powerful family in the region, and were known by local settlers simply as "the Family". His nine aunts and uncles, and seventeen siblings and cousins on his father's side, married into other affluent families, developing a strong network in the region that perpetuated their wealth and influence, and increased their slaveholdings in each successive generation. By the time of the American Revolution, six of the ten largest <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20colonial%20United%20States">slaveholders</a> in the lower Cape Fear region were in some way related to Moore. The Moore family relied on the production of <a href="naval%20stores">naval stores</a> and lumber, as the lower Cape Fear was unsuited to mass cultivation of more profitable products and crops like rice and <a href="Indigofera">indigo</a>.

One early description of Moore states that he spent his early years on his father's plantation until that tract sold in 1761. In his adulthood, Moore married Anna Ivey, with whom he had two sons and two daughters, all of whom survived him at his death. One son, James Moore Jr., would serve in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> as a lieutenant before being permanently disabled by wounds received at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Eutaw%20Springs">Battle of Eutaw Springs</a>.

James Moore had experience as a military officer before the American Revolution. In 1758, Governor <a href="Arthur%20Dobbs">Arthur Dobbs</a> appointed him as the <a href="captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> of a <a href="Provincial%20troops%20in%20the%20French%20and%20Indian%20Wars">provincial garrison company</a> at <a href="Fort%20Johnston%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Fort Johnston</a>, and Moore remained in command of that unit during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>. During that conflict, Moore was captain of a company he led to South Carolina to defend that colony against <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> attacks brought on by the <a href="Anglo-Cherokee%20War">Anglo-Cherokee War</a>. By 1759, he was appointed a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>. In protest of the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a>, in 1766 Moore led an armed mob that occupied the de facto capital town of <a href="Brunswick%20Town%2C%20North%20Carolina">Brunswick, North Carolina</a>. The mob appointed Moore as its delegate to confront Governor <a href="William%20Tryon">William Tryon</a> and the royal comptroller of customs, William Pennington, who had taken refuge at Tryon's home. Pennington gave in to the demands of the mob, and resigned his post, swearing that he would not enforce the provisions of the Stamp Act.

Moore served as a colonel of an <a href="artillery">artillery</a> company in the colonial militia during the War of the Regulation, a revolt by western settlers against perceived injustices in the colonial government of North Carolina in the decade immediately preceding the American Revolution. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alamance">Battle of Alamance</a>, Moore served as the commander of Governor Tryon's artillery company. Moore's orders in that engagement were to fire his cannons once Tryon had determined the Regulators would not surrender, thus signaling the beginning of the battle. During the conflict, however, the governor's artillery functioned poorly, and the Regulators were able to gain an initial advantage by fighting in an irregular fashion. The governor's forces eventually succeeded in crushing the armed farmers, thus ending the Regulator rebellion. Moore went on to serve in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1764 to 1771 and again in 1773, representing his home county of New Hanover. In 1772, he purchased a plantation of on the Cape Fear River several miles upriver from Wilmington.

Moore participated in the Wilmington chapter of the <a href="Sons%20of%20Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> beginning in 1770, and through them organized a boycott of imported British goods on the Cape Fear River. On July 21, 1774, Moore was elected to a Wilmington-based committee tasked with organizing the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress%23First%20Provincial%20Congress">First North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> with other counties. Moore also participated in the New Hanover <a href="Committee%20of%20Safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a>, and worked with other local citizens to raise supplies for <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, whose <a href="Port%20of%20Boston">port</a> had been closed to all commerce in 1774 by the <a href="Boston%20Port%20Act">Boston Port Act</a>. In August 1775, he was elected to the Third Provincial Congress, which organized the colonial militia and placed Moore in command of the first regiment raised to be trained as regular soldiers. At the time, <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a>-sympathizer and Cape Fear-area diarist <a href="Janet%20Schaw">Janet Schaw</a> described her fear of Moore as the commander of the Patriot militia, stating:

Moore's appointment as commander of the first regiment of what would become the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Line">North Carolina Line</a> came at the expense of his brother-in-law, John Ashe, who actively sought the appointment. Moore bested Ashe by only a single vote in the Provincial Congress.

On February 15, 1776, Moore was given command of the <a href="1st%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">1st North Carolina Regiment</a> raised at the direction of the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>, and placed in charge of the defense of the Cape Fear region. At the same time, the colonial government in <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern</a> organized militia units under Colonel <a href="Richard%20Caswell">Richard Caswell</a>, and sent this force south to meet up with Moore's regiment of regulars and several other units of militia. A force of approximately 1,400 <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highland</a> Scots denizens of North Carolina who remained loyal to Britain was organized shortly after the outbreak of hostilities in 1775. This force, concentrated around the <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> hotbed of Cross Creek (near modern-day <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville</a>), alarmed the Patriot government, who dispatched Moore and Caswell to contain the growing army.

The <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">British Army</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, in cooperation with the Loyalist elements of the colonial government under Governor <a href="Josiah%20Martin">Josiah Martin</a>, planned an invasion of North Carolina near Wilmington, a burgeoning and strategically located seaport in the Cape Fear region. The Highlander units at Cross Creek were directed to join up with British Army units, which General <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a> intended to land in North Carolina. Moore led his command upriver along the south bank of the Cape Fear and fortified a river crossing at Rockfish Creek, which would have been the Loyalists' most direct path to Wilmington. At this site, Moore continued to gather reinforcements, eventually commanding approximately 1,100 men. Brigadier General Donald MacDonald, who commanded the militia of approximately 1,500 Highlanders, sent an envoy to Moore, demanding that he join the Loyalist cause or be faced with an attack. Moore, delaying in his reply to buy time, eventually declined that demand, essentially calling MacDonald's bluff. MacDonald, whose men lacked the morale for an immediate confrontation, received word that Caswell's militia had been ordered to join with Moore. Sensing that time was of the essence, MacDonald withdrew, and led the Loyalist contingent away from Moore toward a crossing further downriver.

Moore next set about devising a trap for MacDonald's Loyalist contingent. He positioned a detachment of men at Cross Creek, and ordered the regiments of Colonels Caswell and <a href="Alexander%20Lillington">Alexander Lillington</a> to a location downriver in the path of the Loyalist militia. The Loyalist force managed to slip past Caswell, at which point Moore ordered Caswell to join up with Lillington at a location known as Moore's Creek Bridge. Simultaneously with Caswell's corrective maneuver, Moore floated his troops downriver, where they disembarked and joined in the pursuit of MacDonald's force. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moore%27s%20Creek%20Bridge">Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge</a>, the Loyalists attempted to cross over the creek in the early morning hours of February 27, 1776, where they were met with fierce resistance from Caswell and Lillington's united forces. The Patriots routed the Loyalists in less than three minutes, inflicting severe casualties on MacDonald's men and capturing 850 loyalist soldiers and officers, while themselves suffering only a single casualty.

Moore did not participate directly in the battle, but arrived shortly after it was decided, and pursued the remaining Loyalist units. Moore's Creek Bridge stopped the British plan for the conquest of North Carolina and was celebrated by Patriots throughout the colonies. The British press of the time downplayed the victory as a defeat of Loyalist forces rather than of regular British Army units. On March 4, 1776, the Provincial Congress in New Bern passed a resolution thanking Moore for his service in suppressing the Loyalists.

On March 1, 1776, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> voted to give Moore a commission as a <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> in the Continental Army, and placed him in command of all of the regular army forces in North Carolina. Moore was one of only five North Carolinians to achieve the rank of brigadier general or higher in the Continental Army. As a brigadier, he served under General <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a>, commander of the army's <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army">Southern Department</a>, and was tasked with guarding Wilmington from attacks by British ships lurking in the Cape Fear area after the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. In that capacity, Moore alternately harassed and observed the British and their Loyalist auxiliaries while simultaneously improving Wilmington's defenses by erecting two new coastal <a href="artillery%20battery">batteries</a>, and by sinking ships in the main channel of the Cape Fear River south of the city to bar passage by larger vessels. In April and May 1776, some British units from the approximately 7,000-strong force of General <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a> disembarked near Wilmington, and threatened to confront Moore's garrison of 1,847 men. Clinton soon decided that North Carolina was not an ideal objective, and the majority of the British fleet and army made its way south to Charleston on May 30, 1776.

After the near-engagement at Wilmington, Moore devised a plan by which the Provincial Congress raised five additional companies of men to defend North Carolina's coast. He saw this as necessary because the Continental Army units in North Carolina could be ordered out of the state, which would have left North Carolina relatively defenseless. Lee was recalled to the north to aid in the <a href="New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey%20campaign">defense of New York</a> in September 1776, and Moore was placed in command of the Southern Department. Initially, the Continental Congress ordered Moore to join General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in the north, but owing to the continued threat of a British attack in North or South Carolina, Congress suspended Moore's orders and gave North Carolina's Provincial Council discretion over his disposition. On October 23, 1776, the Council ordered Moore to remain in North Carolina and winter his troops in New Bern and Wilmington. This order was confirmed by the Continental Congress on November 16, along with instructions for Moore to assist in repelling any invasion attempts in South Carolina or Georgia, if necessary.

Moore then led his command of about 2,035 men south to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a> in November to assist the Patriot forces there after the attempted British assault at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sullivan%27s%20Island">Sullivan's Island</a>. Moore's brigade arrived in January, but Moore spent most of his time traveling between Charleston and North Carolina, lobbying for funds and clothing for his poorly equipped soldiers, and recruiting more men. He went so far as to obtain a private loan from <a href="Thomas%20Polk">Thomas Polk</a>, a planter in <a href="Mecklenburg%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Mecklenburg County</a>, for $6,250 in South Carolina currency to pay for rations for his command. Moore's unit engaged in daily drills under his supervision and that of Colonel Francis Nash. Despite these efforts, the North Carolinians suffered from rampant colds and pneumonia, and many of the enlisted men deserted to join the South Carolina line because of the high bounty being offered by that state for service.

In February 1777, the Continental Congress commanded Moore to bring North Carolina's Continental Army troops north to aid Washington, but a lack of supplies and provisions stalled that plan. Moore himself had returned to North Carolina on January 8, 1777, in an attempt to alleviate the poor conditions in which his soldiers found themselves, and to raise funds to pay his men, leaving the Southern Department under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Robert%20Howe%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Howe</a>. Howe countermanded Moore's instructions to bring the Continental Army units north by refusing to permit the North Carolina brigade to leave Charleston out of fear of a British attack in the south. Because of Moore's failing health, Francis Nash was promoted to brigadier general, and assumed command of the brigade on its march north.

While preparing to march north in early 1777, Moore became ill. He died of what was called "a fit of <a href="gout">gout</a> in his stomach" on about April 15, 1777. Oral tradition holds that Moore died on the same day and in the same house as his brother, Maurice. Anne, Moore's wife, died a few months thereafter.

Moore, who had not been directly involved in any military engagement during the Revolutionary War, was nonetheless able to construct a working military force out of the disparate parts provided for him by North Carolina. <a href="Samuel%20A%27Court%20Ashe">Samuel A'Court Ashe</a>, an early North Carolina historian, described Moore as "perhaps the most masterful military man furnished by North Carolina to the war of independence." Another historian speculated that Moore's "actions had held the promise of greatness." Moore's strategic command before and during the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge has been acclaimed as a major factor in the Patriot victory there.

Peter Drummond (RAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir Peter Roy Maxwell Drummond, (2 June 1894 – 27 March 1945) was an Australian-born senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF). He rose from <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private soldier</a> in World War I to air marshal in World War II. Drummond enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in 1914 and the following year saw service as a <a href="medical%20orderly">medical orderly</a> during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. He joined the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1916 and became a <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle Eastern theatre</a>, where he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a>. Transferring to the RAF on its formation in 1918, he remained in the British armed forces for the rest of his life.

Between the wars, Drummond saw action in the Sudan—earning appointment as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a>—and was posted to Australia on secondment to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) as Director of Operations and Intelligence. In Britain, he commanded RAF stations <a href="RAF%20Tangmere">Tangmere</a> and <a href="RAF%20Northolt">Northolt</a>. Ranked <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> at the outbreak of World War II, he was Air Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Sir Arthur Tedder's</a> Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">RAF Middle East</a> from 1941 to 1943. Drummond was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1941 for his services in the Middle East, and <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">knighted in the same order</a> two years later. He was twice offered command of the RAAF during the war but the RAF was unwilling to release him to take up the position. Britain's <a href="Air%20Council">Air Member for Training</a> from 1943, Drummond was <a href="The%20disappearance%20of%20Liberator%20Commando%20and%20its%20occupants">killed in a plane crash at sea</a> in 1945.

Drummond was born on 2 June 1894 in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Western Australia, to merchant John Maxwell Drummond and his wife Caroline ("née" Lockhart). Registered as Roy Maxwell Drummond, he acquired the nickname "Peter" during his schooling at <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Perth">Scotch College</a>, and formally adopted it as his first name in 1943. He served in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadets</a> and worked as a bank <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a> before enlisting in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> on 10 September 1914.

At 5 ft 7in (171 cm) in height, Drummond was judged too slight of build for the <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and was instead assigned to the 2nd Stationary Hospital of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> as an <a href="orderly">orderly</a>. By December 1914, when his unit sailed for Egypt, Drummond was ranked <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. He was sent to <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> in April 1915 and served on a <a href="hospital%20ship">hospital ship</a>, assisting surgeons in operations on the wounded. Drummond was evacuated to England later that year, suffering from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. In December, he applied for a transfer to the British <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) and was discharged from the Australian Army in April 1916.

Following pilot training in the United Kingdom, Drummond received the rank of temporary <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> and was posted to Egypt, where he was assigned to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>, <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (numbered 67 Squadron RFC by the British). During the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>, he took part in the air assaults that preceded the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magdhaba">Battle of Magdhaba</a> on 23 December 1916. He later wrote, "The day before the Magdhaba battle, the whole crowd of us with all the bombs we could carry, went out. You couldn't see the place for smoke after we had left ... The Turks were retreating all the time and we had great sport coming down to about 50 feet and peppering them with machine guns ..." On 20 March 1917, Drummond, flying a <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a>, was one of two pilots who strafed enemy troops threatening Lieutenant <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a> as he rescued a downed Australian airman, the action for which McNamara was awarded his <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>.

Drummond was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty" on 20 April 1917, when he and Lieutenant <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a> engaged and drove off six enemy aircraft that were attempting to bomb Allied cavalry; the award was promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 16 August. Drummond was promoted to temporary <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 1 May 1917. Later that month he was appointed a <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a> in No. 1 Squadron, with the temporary rank of <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>. He joined <a href="No.%20111%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 111 Squadron RFC</a> as a flight commander and temporary captain in October. On 12 December, he and his observer were escorting two Australian aircraft in a <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighter</a> near <a href="Tulkarm">Tul Karem</a>, Palestine, when they were spotted by three German <a href="Albatros%20D.II">Albatros</a> scouts. Drummond attacked and destroyed all three of the enemy aircraft. This achievement earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his "great skill and daring"; the award was promulgated on 26 March 1918.

On 27 March 1918, again near Tul Karem, Drummond and another pilot scrambled to attack a German scout. As his wingman dealt with the intruder, Drummond, flying a <a href="Nieuport">Nieuport</a>, single-handedly engaged six other German aircraft that had suddenly appeared. According to his own account, after he had destroyed one and "sent another down in a spin", Drummond developed engine trouble and had to land behind enemy lines. Finding his engine firing again, he took off before he could be captured by Turkish troops and gained a start over the four still-circling German scouts, "who had also concluded that the fight was over". He was forced to land three more times in enemy territory—once in a cavalry camp where he "carried away a line full of washing" with his <a href="Landing%20gear">undercarriage</a> in his escape—before he shook off all but one of the pursuing fighters and landed safely behind Allied lines. He was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his DSO on 26 July for his "gallant and successful" actions.

The RFC merged with the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> to form the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) on 1 April 1918. Drummond was given command of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B145%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 145 Squadron RAF</a>, which operated <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a> fighters, in July 1918, and was made an acting <a href="major">major</a> on 2 September. He finished the war an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>, credited with eight victories, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 5 June 1919.

Drummond remained in the RAF following World War I, holding command of No. 111 Squadron in 1919, and receiving his permanent commission as an acting captain on 1 August that year. He was based in the Sudan from January to July 1920, as part of Britain's system of "control without occupation", using aircraft instead of armies to put down local rebellions. As acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, Drummond commanded "H" Unit, the entire complement of which consisted of two aircraft. Returning to Britain, he was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 22 July 1921 in recognition of his "excellent work" in the face of "adverse conditions", conducting a successful reconnaissance and bombing campaign against <a href="Nuer%20people">Garjak Nuer tribesmen</a>. He entered <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, in 1922.

On 1 January 1923, Drummond was promoted to squadron leader; he graduated from Andover the same year. Also in 1923, he proposed an officer exchange scheme for the RAF and the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Following a staff posting to the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>, he was seconded to the RAAF in 1925, serving four years as Director of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. He married Isabel Drake-Brockman, cousin of Brigadier General <a href="Edmund%20Drake-Brockman">Edmund Drake-Brockman</a>, at St John's Anglican Church in <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a>, Victoria, on 17 July 1929; the couple had a son and two daughters. Drummond returned to the UK in November that year. He studied at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College, London</a>, in 1930, and was promoted <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 July 1931. From November 1931 to June 1933, he commanded <a href="RAF%20Tangmere">RAF Tangmere</a>, a fighter base. After Tangmere, Drummond spent three years at the Air Ministry. In September 1936 he assumed command of <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a>. While in charge of Northolt he was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> on 1 January 1937. That November, Drummond was appointed senior air staff officer (SASO) at <a href="RAF%20Middle%20East%20Command">RAF Middle East</a> in Cairo. He was raised to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> on 1 July 1939.

At the outbreak of World War II, Drummond was still SASO RAF Middle East. In early 1940 he became involved in preparations for <a href="Operation%20Pike">Operation Pike</a>, an Anglo-French plan to bomb oil fields in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>; the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> was at this time seen as allied to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, in the wake of the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> and the <a href="Winter%20War">Winter War</a>. Drummond led a delegation to <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, Syria, to discuss Turkey's defence again possible German or Russian attack. He planned to operate British aircraft out of French bases in northern Syria if Pike went ahead. Drummond was made an acting <a href="air%20vice-marshal">air vice-marshal</a> on 19 June 1940, and temporary air vice-marshal on 10 January the next year. On 1 June 1941, he was raised to acting <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and appointed Deputy <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief</a> (AOC-in-C) RAF Middle East, following Air Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Sir Arthur Tedder's</a> elevation to AOC-in-C. The "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>" credits Tedder and Drummond with developing their command as "a mobile strike-force capable of co-operating fully with the other two services", and Tedder later remarked on the importance of his deputy's contribution to the Allied victory in North Africa. Tedder's biographer, <a href="Vincent%20Orange%20%28historian%29">Vincent Orange</a>, contended that "Tedder's growing eminence ... owes a great deal to Drummond's wise and dedicated support".
Drummond considered the Middle East a "Battle for Airfields", as whichever side held the Mediterranean landing grounds could protect its shipping at the expense of the enemy's. Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Sir Andrew Cunningham</a> found Drummond "a thorough non-cooperator" but Drummond's assistant, <a href="Arthur%20Lee%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Arthur Lee</a>, described him as "a refreshing man to work with ... without pose or frills, serious, but with a sense of humour nearly as irreverent and sarcastic as Tedder's". Drummond was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> on 24 September 1941 "in recognition of distinguished services rendered in operational commands of the Royal Air Force" from 1 October 1940 to 31 March 1941. His temporary rank of air vice-marshal was made substantive on 14 April 1942.

In early 1942 the Australian government sought Drummond for the position of <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) of the RAAF, to succeed Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, RAF, at the completion of the latter's two-year term. Australia's <a href="List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20Australia%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a>, had recommended Drummond in a cable to Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> on 5 February. Although the British government was initially supportive of the plan, the Air Ministry eventually declined to release Drummond from his role in the Middle East, partly to avoid disruption to the region's command and also because it did not believe that Drummond's operational abilities would be put to sufficient use in the largely administrative role of CAS. Drummond himself was reportedly dubious about the appointment because of the division of authority between RAAF Headquarters and Allied Air Force Headquarters, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA).

Burnett had recommended his deputy, Air Vice-Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">William Bostock</a>, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice-marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 to bring in an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian government. Drummond had indicated that he was happy to serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a seat on the <a href="Air%20Council">Air Council</a> as Air Member for Training.

Drummond succeeded Air Marshal <a href="Guy%20Garrod">Sir Guy Garrod</a> as Air Member for Training on 27 April 1943. He was raised to temporary air marshal on 1 June 1943, and appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> the following day. Drummond's position on the Air Council included administering the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, making him partly responsible for the serious oversupply of aircrew that was apparent by 1944; Drummond believed that the situation would only be counteracted if the upcoming <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of Europe</a> led to heavy casualties. He remained an advocate of close cooperation between the RAF and <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a> air forces; the <a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">Adelaide "Advertiser"</a> quoted him as saying, "Daily journeying to my London office ... I make a point of passing the <a href="Boomerang%20Club">Boomerang Club</a> at <a href="Australia%20House">Australia House</a> just for the pleasure and gratification of swapping a salute and a 'good day' with some of the best air crew in the world—the RAAF."

On 27 March 1945, Drummond was "en route" to Canada with other dignitaries to attend a ceremony marking the closure of the Empire Air Training Scheme. His plane, a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> nicknamed "<a href="Commando%20%28aircraft%29">Commando</a>" that was formerly the personal transport of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, disappeared near the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and all aboard were presumed killed. Frank McNamara, now an RAAF air vice-marshal based in England and a close friend, broke the news to Drummond's widow. Air Marshal <a href="Roderic%20Hill">Sir Roderic Hill</a> succeeded Drummond as Air Member for Training.

Drummond was survived by his wife and three children. A memorial service for the victims of the Azores flight was held at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> on 8 May 1945. Drummond was twice mentioned in despatches for his service in World War II, on 11 June 1942, and on 19 September 1946 (for his performance as SASO RAF Middle East in 1940–41). On 3 May 1946, he was posthumously granted permission to wear the award of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Phoenix%20%28Greek%20order%29">Commander of the Order of the Phoenix</a>, conferred by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Kingdom of Greece</a>. Tedder wrote in 1948 that Drummond as Deputy AOC-in-C Middle East "bore so much of the burden and took so little of the credit"; Vincent Orange observed that the two commanders remained friends and that Drummond "might well have succeeded Tedder as <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>" but for his early death. He is commemorated on Panel 264 of the <a href="Air%20Forces%20Memorial">Runnymede Memorial</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>.

Over the Edge (1999)

Over the Edge (1999) was a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">event</a> produced by the <a href="WWE">World Wrestling Federation</a> (WWF) on May 23, 1999, at <a href="Kemper%20Arena">Kemper Arena</a> in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It was the first event not to be promoted under the "<a href="In%20Your%20House">In Your House</a>" series of pay-per-views, which typically occurred in months not occupied by the WWF's biggest events (<a href="Royal%20Rumble">Royal Rumble</a>, <a href="WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a>, <a href="King%20of%20the%20Ring">King of the Ring</a>, <a href="SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a>, and <a href="Survivor%20Series">Survivor Series</a>).

<a href="Owen%20Hart">Owen Hart</a> was scheduled to face <a href="Charles%20Wright%20%28wrestler%29">The Godfather</a> for the <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">WWF Intercontinental Championship</a> during the event. Wrestling under his Blue Blazer <a href="Gimmick%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">gimmick</a>, Hart was set to make a superhero-like <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Ring%20entrance">ring entrance</a>, which would have seen him descend from the <a href="Rafter">arena rafters</a> into the <a href="Wrestling%20ring">ring</a>. He was, however, released prematurely when the <a href="Abseiling">harness line</a> malfunctioned, and <a href="Owen%20Hart%23Death">fell</a> more than into the ring and died. Criticism later arose over the WWF's decision to continue the show after Hart's accident. In court, his widow <a href="Martha%20Hart">Martha</a>, children, and parents sued the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">organization</a>, contending that poor planning of the dangerous stunt caused Owen's death. WWF <a href="Settlement%20%28litigation%29">settled</a> the case out of court, paying <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>18 million to his widow, children, and parents. Due to the accident and controversy surrounding the event, the Over the Edge name was retired. The event was also not released for home video viewing until the launch of the <a href="WWE%20Network">WWE Network</a> in 2014 where an edited version of the show removing any mention of Hart's death was released.

In the <a href="main%20event">main event</a>, <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> defeated <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a> in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">singles match</a> (with <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and <a href="Shane%20McMahon">Shane McMahon</a> as the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Special%20referee">guest referees</a>) to win the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWF Championship</a>. Of the six scheduled bouts on the <a href="undercard">undercard</a>, two received more promotion than the others. The first was a singles match, in which <a href="Dwayne%20Johnson">The Rock</a> defeated <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> by disqualification. The other was an <a href="Elimination%20tag%20team%20match">eight-man elimination tag team match</a>, involving <a href="The%20Union%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Union</a>'s (<a href="Mick%20Foley">Mankind</a>, <a href="Ken%20Shamrock">Ken Shamrock</a>, <a href="Test%20%28wrestler%29">Test</a>, and the <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>) victory over the <a href="Corporate%20Ministry">Corporate Ministry</a> (<a href="Viscera%20%28wrestler%29">Viscera</a>, the <a href="Big%20Boss%20Man%20%28wrestler%29">Big Boss Man</a>, and the <a href="the%20Acolytes%20Protection%20Agency">Acolytes</a> (<a href="John%20Layfield">Bradshaw</a> and <a href="Ron%20Simmons">Faarooq</a>)).

The main narrative for Over the Edge continued the events that unfolded at , WWF's previous pay-per-view event, held on April 25, 1999. There, <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> abducted <a href="Stephanie%20McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, the daughter of chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>. The Undertaker's price for Stephanie's return was control over the wrestling organization. His plans were thwarted, however, by the <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWF Champion</a>, <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">Steve Austin</a>, who rescued Stephanie and denied The Undertaker his ransom. This set up a feud between the two wrestlers, which was settled in a title match at Over the Edge, in which both Vince and his son <a href="Shane%20McMahon">Shane</a>, who had aligned himself with The Undertaker, would serve as the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Special%20referee">guest referee</a>.<ref name="SNH5/2"></ref> Originally Shane had named himself the sole referee of the match, but WWF commissioner <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> made Vince the co-referee in order to level the playing field. WWF further built up the rivalry between The Undertaker and Austin by having them attack each other on WWF programming, before their showdown. On May 3, 1999, The Undertaker threw Austin off the stage, and two weeks later, the WWF Champion handcuffed his title's challenger to a crucifix, which was raised above the ring.<ref name="RAW5/17a"></ref>

Another feud culminating at Over the Edge involved <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a> and <a href="Dwayne%20Johnson">The Rock</a>, who would meet each other in a match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. leading The Rock to wearing his (kayfabe) injured arm in a <a href="Orthopedic%20cast">plaster cast</a>. Shane, acting as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.

The pay-per-view event contained the rivalry among two <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20stable">stables</a>, the <a href="Corporate%20Ministry">Corporate Ministry</a> and the <a href="The%20Union%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">Union</a>. The Corporate Ministry was formed when the <a href="The%20Corporation%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">Corporation</a> merged with the <a href="The%20Ministry%20of%20Darkness">Ministry of Darkness</a>; the Corporate Ministry consisted of <a href="Viscera%20%28wrestler%29">Viscera</a>, the <a href="Big%20Boss%20Man%20%28wrestler%29">Big Boss Man</a>, and the <a href="Acolytes%20Protection%20Agency">Acolytes</a> (<a href="John%20Layfield">Bradshaw</a> and <a href="Ron%20Simmons">Faarooq</a>).<ref name="SD4/29a"></ref> Throughout the month of May, the Ministry was involved in matches with <a href="Mick%20Foley">Mankind</a>, <a href="Ken%20Shamrock">Ken Shamrock</a>, the <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a>, and <a href="Test%20%28wrestler%29">Test</a>, and in retaliation, the four wrestlers formed the Union stable. The WWF continued to enhance the feud over several weeks, which included a brawl among all eight wrestlers on May 10, 1999. The feud led to an <a href="Elimination%20tag%20team%20match">eight-man elimination tag team match</a> between both groups at Over the Edge.

Other feuds included <a href="Billy%20Gunn">Billy Gunn</a> against his former partner <a href="Road%20Dogg">Road Dogg</a>, the <a href="Owen%20Hart">Blue Blazer</a> against <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">WWF Intercontinental Champion</a> <a href="Charles%20Wright%20%28wrestler%29">The Godfather</a>, <a href="Mark%20Henry">Mark Henry</a> and <a href="D%27Lo%20Brown">D'Lo Brown</a> against <a href="World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">WWF Tag Team Champions</a> <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a> and <a href="Sean%20Waltman">X-Pac</a>, <a href="Bob%20Holly">Hardcore Holly</a> against <a href="Al%20Snow">Al Snow</a> in a <a href="Hardcore%20wrestling">Hardcore</a> singles match for the <a href="WWE%20Hardcore%20Title">Hardcore Title</a>, and a <a href="mixed%20tag%20team%20match">mixed tag team match</a> pitting <a href="Sean%20Morley">Val Venis</a> and <a href="Nicole%20Bass">Nicole Bass</a> against <a href="Jeff%20Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> and <a href="Debra%20Marshall">Debra</a> were also advertised.

Before the event began and aired <a href="Live%20television">live</a> on pay-per-view, an episode of "Sunday Night Heat" aired live on the <a href="USA%20Network">USA Network</a>. <a href="Shawn%20Stasiak">Meat</a> defeated <a href="Brian%20Christopher">Brian Christopher</a>, while the <a href="Hardy%20Boyz">Hardy Boyz</a> (<a href="Matt%20Hardy">Matt Hardy</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Hardy">Jeff Hardy</a>) defeated <a href="Goldust">Goldust</a> and the <a href="The%20Blue%20Meanie">Blue Meanie</a>. After the match, <a href="The%20Brood%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Brood</a> gave The Hardy Boyz and Hayes a bloodbath. In the final contest, Vince McMahon and <a href="Dennis%20Knight">Mideon</a> fought to a no-contest, when the Corporate Ministry attacked Vince and broke his ankle (<a href="kayfabe">kayfabe</a>) in order to prevent him from refereeing the main event match.

Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler were the English commentators for the event, while Carlos Cabrera and Hugo Savinovich were the Spanish commentators. Howard Finkel acted as the ring announcer. The referees included Tim White, Mike Chioda, and Teddy Long. Other officials include Vince McMahon, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco.

After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view began with a tag team match, in which the WWF Tag Team Champions Kane and X-Pac defended against Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown. During the match, Henry lifted X-Pac and rammed his back against the steel ring post at ringside. Afterward, Brown and Henry simultaneously attacked X-Pac, which led Kane to launch himself from the top turnbuckle onto Brown and Henry. After the competitors reentered the ring, Kane performed a <a href="chokeslam">chokeslam</a> on Henry, lifting him by the throat and slamming him down. Kane then <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinned</a> Henry to retain the WWF Tag Team Title. Next was the hardcore match, which allowed no <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Disqualification">disqualifications</a> or <a href="countout">countout</a>s. WWF Hardcore Champion Al Snow defended against Hardcore Holly. Holly and Snow began their match in the ring but moved their brawl into the arena stands. From there, they proceeded to the backstage area, and into the concession stands before returning to the ring. The fight was decided when Snow <a href="Powerbomb">lifted Holly onto his shoulders and threw him</a> through a <a href="Table%20%28furniture%29">wooden table</a>. Successfully covering and pinning Holly, Snow retained the WWF Hardcore Title.
The next scheduled match was a singles match for the WWF Intercontinental Title between The Godfather (champion) and the Blue Blazer. As Hart descended into the ring on a <a href="safety%20harness">safety harness</a>, the equipment gave way, and he fell. <a href="Emergency%20medical%20technician">Emergency medical technician</a>s (EMTs) rushed him to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. The show was halted for 15 minutes before it continued with the next match, a mixed tag team match pitting Val Venis and Nicole Bass against Jeff Jarrett and Debra. At one point, Jarrett attempted to hit Bass with a guitar, but Venis took the guitar away, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Back%20body%20drop">dropped</a> Jarrett on the mat and pinned him. In the fourth match of the evening, Billy Gunn defeated his former tag team partner Road Dogg, after hitting him with the time keeper's hammer.

The fifth match was the eight-man elimination tag-team match between The Union and the Corporate Ministry. Test was eliminated by pinfall after Bradshaw performed a "<a href="Clothesline%20from%20hell">Clothesline from Hell</a>" on him. Bradshaw was then eliminated by <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Submission">submission</a> as a result of Ken Shamrock's <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Ankle%20lock">ankle lock</a>. Afterwards, Shamrock was eliminated via disqualification as a result of attacking the <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">referee</a>. Then, Faarooq was eliminated by pinfall after the Big Show chokeslammed him. Only one member of each team remained after Viscera and the Big Show failed to return to the ring within ten seconds, and were counted out as a result. The Union won the match after Mankind forced Boss Man to submit with the <a href="Mandible%20claw">Mandible claw</a>. It was at this point that the viewers at home were told by <a href="Jim%20Ross">Jim Ross</a> that Owen Hart had died.

The final match on the <a href="undercard">undercard</a> pitted Triple H against The Rock. Triple H targeted The Rock's injured arm. Towards the end of the match, Triple H asked <a href="Chyna">Chyna</a>, his <a href="Manager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">valet</a>, to retrieve a folding chair. The referee, however, took it away from him, which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; Triple H pushed down the referee, for which he was disqualified Triple H, giving The Rock the victory. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.

In the main event Stone Cold Steve Austin defended his WWF Championship against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were supposed to be the guest referees, Vince McMahon had his ankle (kayfabe) broken earlier in the event and was replaced by his accomplice <a href="Pat%20Patterson%20%28wrestler%29">Pat Patterson</a>, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, could not continue after the Undertaker chokeslammed him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, <a href="Gerald%20Brisco">Gerald Brisco</a>, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and counted the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was attacked by the Undertaker. Vince then came down to the ring to act as referee, but when Austin forcefully executed a <a href="Stunner%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">stunner</a> on the Undertaker, Shane prevented Vince from performing a three count. As Vince, Shane and Austin, argued, Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Roll-up">roll-up</a> by The Undertaker. Shane performed a fast count to give Undertaker the victory and the WWF Championship.

When Owen Hart was to challenge The Godfather for the WWF Intercontinental Champion's title, he was performing as the Blue Blazer. The <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Character">character</a>, originally used by Hart in the late 1980s, had recently been revived as a superhero <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Gimmick">gimmick</a> that parodied various wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to emulate <a href="World%20Championship%20Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a> (WCW) wrestler Sting's (<a href="Steve%20Borden">Steve Borden</a>) ring entrance by descending from the arena rafters into the ring. The entrance was successfully tested on the November 15, 1998, episode of "Sunday Night Heat" (that year's <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%281998%29">Survivor Series</a> pre-show, and using a different harness configuration); however, during his descent at Over the Edge, a cable disengaged from the safety vest he wore, and he fell more than from the rafters into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first on one of the ring's padded <a href="turnbuckle">turnbuckle</a>s. The accident was not seen by television viewers. A pre-recorded interview video was shown at the start of Hart's descent, and when the broadcast returned live, the cameras quickly turned away from the ring to the audience. Soon afterward, <a href="Jim%20Ross">Jim Ross</a>, one of the commentators of the event, informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had fallen from the rafters, that the incident was "not a part of the entertainment" and that it was "a real situation". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart <a href="Cardiopulmonary%20resuscitation">CPR</a>, but he showed no response to the treatment. Bringing Hart out on a <a href="gurney">gurney</a>, the EMTs boarded the heavily injured wrestler into an ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>.

After the incident, the event was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate officials made the decision to continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had died at the age of 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.

After the event, in response to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four <a href="House%20show">live events</a> in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and one in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> or <a href="DVD">DVD</a> due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the <a href="WWE%20Network">WWE Network</a>. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on "<a href="WWE%20Raw">Raw is War</a>" in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, which the WWF called "<a href="Raw%20Is%20Owen">Raw is Owen</a>". For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also included interviews and testimonies from his coworkers and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's <a href="funeral">funeral</a> service was held on May 31, 1999, in <a href="Calgary">Calgary, Alberta</a>, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, children, and parents sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that the harness system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, children, and parents <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>18 million. The manufacturer of the harness system had also been named as a defendant in the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.

After Over the Edge, The Rock began a feud with the Undertaker over the WWF Championship, culminating in a match at <a href="King%20of%20the%20Ring%20%281999%29">King of the Ring</a>, after The Rock defeated The Undertaker and Triple H in a <a href="Triple%20Threat%20Match">Triple Threat Match</a>, to earn a WWF Championship match against the Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the Undertaker defeated The Rock to retain his title. Steve Austin engaged in a rivalry with Vince and Shane McMahon in retaliation for their interference during his match at Over the Edge. Austin lost the match at King of the Ring, and his (kayfabe) 50% control in the WWF, but before that he scheduled himself in a title match against the Undertaker on June 28. Austin won the match and the title. Eventually, a feud developed between Austin, Mankind, and Triple H over the WWF title, which led to a match at <a href="SummerSlam%20%281999%29">SummerSlam</a>. There, Mankind won the WWF title. Owen Hart (as his "Blue Blazer" alter-ego) had been booked to win the Intercontinental Title from The Godfather at Over the Edge. Hart's tag team partner and good friend Jeff Jarrett won the title a week later on Raw, using Debra's Women's Championship belt to defeat The Godfather. Jarrett shouted "Owen Hart!" upon being handed the Intercontinental Championship belt.

Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation received strong criticism for designing the stunt and allowing the event to continue after Owen Hart's fall. In his weekly column for the "<a href="Calgary%20Sun">Calgary Sun</a>"—a major newspaper in Hart's hometown—on May 31, 1999, <a href="Bret%20Hart">Bret Hart</a> blamed Vince McMahon for his brother's death. He "question[ed] if this was really necessary" and said, "Shame on you, Vince McMahon." He also claimed that the tribute show "reeked of disrespect," stating, "Yes, the so-called tribute where afterward wrestlers point to their crotches and say: 'Suck it!' It makes me nauseous." Other members of the Hart family also blamed Vince McMahon for Owen's death, claiming that the accident was the inevitable outcome of "an obsession for ratings and revenues." While in Calgary for Owen's funeral, wrestler <a href="Hulk%20Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> stated, "Hopefully something good will happen. Wrestling's gotten ... way too over the top". In reference to McMahon, he added, "I hope he learns a lesson from this horrible accident". <a href="Ralph%20Klein">Ralph Klein</a>, Alberta's <a href="Premier%20%28Canada%29">premier</a> at the time, expressed a hope that Hart's death would lead to changes in wrestling, stating, "Maybe the various federations will rethink the gimmickry."

"Calgary Sun" columnist Eric Francis called McMahon's decision to continue the event "sick, disrespectful and wrong. But what else would you expect from the WWF?" He added, "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, "It was disgusting. ... For kids to see that, for this to be so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." <a href="Martha%20Hart">Martha Hart</a>, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly in the immediate aftermath of her husband's death. She said that McMahon "absolutely should be there" at the funeral. She also stated, "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision to continue the show after her husband's death, Martha stated, "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not."

The WWF received some support from people who felt that the company did the right thing by continuing the event. <a href="Vince%20Russo">Vince Russo</a>, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that <a href="Brian%20Pillman">Brian Pillman</a>, a family friend of the Harts and a member of <a href="The%20Hart%20Foundation">The Hart Foundation</a>, died shortly before the pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But this is not the time to do it. ... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the "Calgary Sun", stating, "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." Although the WWF had no information, they reported that "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much."

SMS "Schwaben" ("His Majesty's Ship "<a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>"") was the fourth ship of the of <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">German Imperial Navy</a>. "Schwaben" was built at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>. She was laid down in 1900, and completed in April 1904, at the cost of 21,678,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>. Her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s were , , and ; they were the first capital ships built under the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Navy Law of 1898</a>, championed by <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. "Schwaben" was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of .

"Schwaben" spent most of her career as a gunnery training ship from 1904 to 1914, though she frequently participated in the large scale fleet exercises during this period. After the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, the ship was mobilized with her sisters as the IV Battle Squadron. She saw limited duty in the North Sea as a guard ship and in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces. The threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw from the Baltic in 1916. For the remainder of the war, "Schwaben" served as an engineering training ship for navy cadets. She was retained by the <a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a> after the war and reactivated from 1919 until June 1920, serving as a depot ship for F-type <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a> in the Baltic. The ship was stricken from the navy list in March 1921 and sold for scrapping in that year.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The "Wittelsbach"s were broadly similar to the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.

"Schwaben" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube</a> and six cylindrical coal-fired boilers. "Schwaben"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men.

"Schwaben"s armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. The armament system was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four were on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces, and the <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Schwaben"s <a href="keel%20laying">keel was laid</a> 15 September 1900, at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, under construction number 27. She was ordered under the contract name "G", as a new unit for the fleet. "Schwaben" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 19 August 1901; during the launching ceremony, <a href="William%20II%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">King Wilhelm II of Württemberg</a> gave a speech and his wife <a href="Charlotte%20of%20Schaumburg-Lippe">Queen Charlotte of Württemberg</a> christened the ship. She was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 13 April 1904, the last ship of her class to enter active service. The ship's cost totaled 21,678,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>

There was a dispute over where "Schwaben" should be assigned after her commissioning in April 1904. Admiral <a href="Hans%20von%20Koester">Hans von Koester</a>, the fleet commander, wanted the ship to be assigned to the active duty squadron, but Tirpitz wanted to use the new battleship as a training vessel, since the Training Squadron only possessed cruisers and obsolescent ships. Tirpitz won the debate, and so "Schwaben" was to replace the ancient <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a> <a href="frigate">frigate</a> in the Training Squadron. There, she was to serve as a torpedo training ship. On 18 May, "Schwaben" departed Wilhelmshaven and passed through the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, arriving in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 22 May.

While on <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, she struck an uncharted <a href="shoal">shoal</a> off the northern tip of the island of <a href="Fehmarn">Fehmarn</a>. The impact damaged a length of the ship's hull and holed it in several places. After repairs were completed, she resumed her trials, which lasted until the end of 1904. The trials were interrupted by the annual autumn maneuvers, during which "Schwaben" joined the active fleet in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. On 11 January 1905, she was formally assigned to the Training Squadron, but as an artillery training ship to replace the old vessel . The ship was based in <a href="Sonderburg">Sonderburg</a> in the Baltic, along with the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s and , and several other training ships. She began an annual routine of gunnery training in the western Baltic that was interrupted only by yearly gunnery drills with the entire <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> in October. During these fleet exercises, "Schwaben" was supported by the <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> . "Schwaben" also went into drydock from the end of October to the middle of December every year for periodic maintenance.

"Schwaben" participated in exercises in the <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a> Bay in April and May 1906, and the annual fleet gunnery drills took place off <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> in August. Her annual overhaul was completed early, in November. In March 1907, "Schwaben" participated in gunnery training with the fleet. She joined the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Reserve Squadron, the <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> , for maneuvers off the coast of <a href="Farther%20Pomerania">Farther Pomerania</a> in July. The following month, "Schwaben" served as the flagship of "VAdm" <a href="Hugo%20Zeye">Hugo Zeye</a> for a training squadron during the fleet maneuvers in the North Sea. Directly after the conclusion of the fleet maneuvers in mid-September, "Schwaben" participated in fleet gunnery drills off Helgoland. The year was concluded with an overhaul in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven.

In 1908, the training ships based in the Baltic were placed under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a>, who would go on to command the High Seas Fleet in 1915 during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. That year followed the same pattern as the previous year, but "Schwaben" did not participate in the autumn fleet maneuvers. She instead remained at Sonderburg and <a href="Als%20%28island%29">Alsen</a> during the exercises. In 1909, after the autumn maneuvers, "Schwaben" was assigned as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet, again under the command of Admiral Zeye. During her yearly overhaul at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, her guns were fitted with new motors produced in Germany to test their reliability over foreign-manufactured motors. The tests proved to be successful. While steaming in the <a href="Flensburg%20Firth">Flensburg Firth</a> on 10–12 December, she had to assist the training ship in heavy fog.

In 1910, after the normal training routine in the first half of the year, "Schwaben" was assigned to the <a href="III%20Battle%20Squadron">III Battle Squadron</a> of the High Seas Fleet for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 19 August to 11 September. She served in this role to replace the battleships and , which had been sold to the Ottoman Empire just before the start of the maneuvers. On 14 October, she joined up with the battleship and steamed through the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> to Kiel for her yearly overhaul at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard</a> there. These repairs lasted until 4 January 1911. "Schwaben" served in the III Battle Squadron during the autumn maneuvers again in 1911. By 1911, the eight and es of <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s had entered service; these ships were assigned to the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>, which displaced the newer pre-dreadnoughts of the and es to the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II</a> and III Battle Squadrons. As a result, "Schwaben" was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 30 December 1911 and assigned to the Reserve Division in the North Sea. She was placed back in service briefly from 9 to 12 May 1912 to move to Kiel. "Schwaben" returned to service again to participate in the autumn maneuvers from 14 August to 28 September, as the flagship of then-"KAdm" <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a>.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, "Schwaben" and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>—usually stationed in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>—and for operations in the Baltic. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including "Schwaben", was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. "Schwaben" and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, "KAdm" Alberts.

On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. "Schwaben" and the other ships stood off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings, which the Russians did not attempt. On 10 May, after the invasion force had entered Libau, the British submarines and spotted the IV Squadron, but were too far away to make an attack. The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships. As a result, "Schwaben" and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">assaulted the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, due to the scarcity of escorts. On 29 August, "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain at Sea) Walter Engelhardt replaced Alberts aboard "Schwaben". She was then used as a guard ship in Libau, starting on 24 September. On 10–11 November, "Schwaben", her sisters and , and "Prinz Heinrich" left Libau, bound for Kiel.

By late 1915, the increasing threat from British submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly "Wittelsbach"-class ships from active service. On 20 November "Schwaben" steamed to Wilhelmshaven, where she replaced as a training ship for engineers, a role she held for the remainder of the war. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May – 1 June, in which "Schwaben" did not take part, Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>, the commander of the German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> squadron, sent his four surviving battlecruisers to dock for repairs. Hipper made "Schwaben", which was stationed in Wilhelmshaven, his temporary command ship while his force was being repaired. In 1916, "Schwaben" was partially disarmed; the four 24 cm guns were removed, her battery of 15 cm guns was reduced to six weapons, and only four 8.8 cm guns were left aboard.

The ship was briefly retained by the <a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a> after the war, and was reactivated for service on 1 August 1919. According to Articles 182 and 193 of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, Germany was obliged to keep sufficient vessels in commission to sweep <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> from large areas in the North and Baltic Seas. "Schwaben" was therefore converted into a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a> for F-type minesweepers to assist in meeting Germany's treaty obligations, which entailed removal of her remaining weaponry and construction of platforms to hold the minesweepers. She was assigned to the 6th Baltic Minesweeping Half-Flotilla, though this service did not last long, as the minesweeping work was completed by 19 June 1920. The old battleship was stricken from the naval register on 8 March 1921. She was sold for 3,090,000 <a href="Papiermark">marks</a> and <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap that year in Kiel-Nordmole.

SMS "Elsass" was the second of five <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the in the <a href="Imperial%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Imperial Navy</a>. She was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in May 1901, <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in May 1903, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> in November 1904, though an accident during <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> delayed her completion until May 1905. She was named for the German province of <a href="Elsass-Lothringen">Elsass</a>, now the French region of <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a>. Her sister ships were , , and . The ship was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, "Elsass" was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, her career as a frontline battleship was cut short.

The ship served in the II Squadron of the German fleet after commissioning, and during this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training, as well as making good-will visits to foreign countries. Surpassed by new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, "Elsass" was decommissioned in 1913, though she was reactivated a year later following the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and assigned to the <a href="VI%20Battle%20Squadron">VI Battle Squadron</a>. "Elsass" saw action in the Baltic Sea against the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a>. In August 1915, she participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>, during which she engaged the Russian battleship . In 1916, she was placed in reserve because of crew shortages and the threat of British <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s operating in the Baltic, and she spent the remainder of the war as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>.

She was retained after the war under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, and was modernized in 1923–1924. "Elsass" served in the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" with the surface fleet until 1930, conducting training operations and visits to foreign ports as she had earlier in her career. In 1930, she was again placed in reserve, and the following year she was stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a>. "Elsass" was used for a short time as a <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> in Wilhelmshaven. The outdated battleship was sold to <a href="Norddeutscher%20Lloyd">Norddeutscher Lloyd</a> in late 1935 and was <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up for scrap</a> the following year.

With the passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> under the direction of "Vizeadmiral" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, the supplier of naval artillery to the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) had developed <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a>, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the "Wittelsbach"s. The Design Department of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s as torpedoes became more effective. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906, just a year after "Elsass" entered service. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Elsass".

"Elsass" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. At full load, she <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> . Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical <a href="Boiler%20%28power%20generation%29">boilers</a>, all of the <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">Scotch type</a>, and all of which burned coal. "Elsass"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of .

"Elsass"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> was composed of fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and eighteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/35</a> quick-firing guns. Her armament was further increased by six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, and the final tube was in the stern. "Elsass" was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick, with the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.

"Elsass" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 26 May 1901 at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> under construction number 97. The second unit of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "J" as a new unit for the fleet. "Elsass" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 26 May 1903, and the launching ceremony was attended by <a href="Hermann%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenlohe-Langenburg">Hermann zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg</a>, the "<a href="Reichsstatthalter">Reichsstatthalter</a>" (Governor) of the ship's <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">namesake province</a>. The ship was transferred to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 26 October 1904 by a shipyard crew. She was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the fleet on 29 November 1904 and began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> thereafter. These were interrupted on 15 December, when the ship's <a href="rudder">rudder</a> broke, forcing her to return for repairs that lasted until February 1905. "Elsass" then returned to trials, which were completed by May. She thereafter joined the <a href="II%20Squadron">II Squadron</a>, replacing the old <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> . Her first commander was then-"<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" ("KzS"—Captain at Sea) <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a>, who remained in the position until September 1905.

For the next several years, "Elsass" and the rest of the fleet were occupied with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May and a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For "Elsass", her career began with squadron training in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> in May 1905, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> visited the German fleet in <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>. "KzS" <a href="Gustav%20Bachmann">Gustav Bachmann</a> took command of the ship in September. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. "KzS" <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.
On 28 April 1908, a significant accident occurred aboard "Elsass", when a round of ammunition exploded. Three men were killed and another six were wounded. In 1908 and 1909, the fleet, which had been renamed the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, undertook major cruises into the Atlantic Ocean. During the first, which began on 13 July 1908, "Elsass" stopped in <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> from 23 July to 1 August before returning to Germany on 13 August for the autumn maneuvers. The 1909 cruise began on 7 July and lasted until 1 August, and included a visit to <a href="El%20Ferrol">El Ferrol</a>, Spain from 18 to 25 July. In September, "KzS" <a href="Hubert%20von%20Rebeur-Paschwitz">Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz</a> replaced Scheer as the ship's commander. The year 1910 followed the same pattern of individual, squadron, and fleet training as in previous years. For the summer cruises of 1910 and 1911, the German fleet went to Norwegian waters; both years also saw winter cruises in the western Baltic. On 14 December 1910, while conducting individual training, "Elsass" collided with the battleship , though neither ship was seriously damaged. "KzS" <a href="Carl%20Schaumann">Carl Schaumann</a> took command of the ship in September 1911, though he remained in command for just a month, being replaced by "KzS" <a href="Hugo%20Langemak">Hugo Langemak</a> in October. "Elsass" was transferred to the <a href="I%20Squadron">I Squadron</a> on 3 October, trading places with the battleship .

On 23 March 1912, during fleet training, "Elsass" accidentally collided with a Swedish steamship——in heavy fog in the western entrance to the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>. "Pollux" was badly damaged in the accident and sank, though "Elsass" was able to take off her crew. In April, "Elsass" served as a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> during gunfire training with the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> in a demonstration held off the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. On the 29th of the month, the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> replaced "Elsass" in the I Squadron, and the latter had her crew reduced. On 24 August, the ship received her full complement again, to allow "Elsass" to take part in the annual maneuvers with the newly formed <a href="III%20Squadron">III Squadron</a>. She also came under the temporary command of "KzS" <a href="Leberecht%20Maass">Leberecht Maass</a>. After the exercises, the squadron was dissolved, and on 29 September "Elsass" again had her crew reduced. She returned to active duty on 1 December, when she was assigned to the V Division of the III Squadron, along with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> and the new dreadnought . The ships began the year with individual training, followed by divisional exercises in the Baltic later in January 1913. In early March, fleet exercises were held in the North Sea. "Elsass" was sent to Kiel on 17 March to begin preparations for her decommissioning, as her place in the division was taken by the new dreadnought . On 13 May, "Elsass" was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. Effective 15 October, she was assigned to the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Ostsee">Marinestation der Ostsee</a>" (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea).

On 28 July 1914, Germany's ally <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> declared war on <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, beginning <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Three days later, "Elsass" was reactivated as the European powers moved toward war, and she was assigned to the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a>. The unit also included her sister ship "Braunschweig" and the five "Wittelsbach"-class battleships, and was commanded by "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt">Ehrhard Schmidt</a>. "Elsass" began individual and then squadron training, which lasted until early September. The training exercises were interrupted on 26 August, when the squadron and the armored cruisers and and the light cruiser were sent to rescue the stranded <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which had run aground off the island of <a href="Odensholm">Odensholm</a> in the eastern Baltic. By 28 August, however, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy "Magdeburg" before the relief force had arrived. As a result, "Braunschweig" and the rest of the squadron returned to <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> that day.

Starting on 2 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by "Blücher", conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. From 11 to 20 September, "Elsass" and the rest of the division was transferred to the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> to provide local defense against possible British attacks. Later that month, the IV Squadron ships were transferred back to the Baltic. The army had requested that the navy make a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a> to keep Russian reserves along the Baltic coast, instead of allowing the Russians to re-deploy them to <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>. The older battleships of the <a href="V%20Battle%20Squadron">V Battle Squadron</a> were sent to Danzig to embark ground forces, while "Braunschweig" and the IV Squadron steamed in advance. The operation was called off early, however, after British <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s were reportedly sighted in the Baltic. The two squadrons rendezvoused off Bornholm before proceeded on to Kiel, arriving on 26 September.

"Elsass" returned to the Elbe from 5 December to 1 March 1915, with scheduled periodic maintenance from 24 to 28 February. After guard ship duties in the Elbe ended, she was briefly transferred to the <a href="Schillig%20Roads">Schillig Roads</a>, outside Wilhelmshaven, from 1 to 9 March. Beginning on 2 April, "Elsass" began training exercises in the Baltic, followed by another shipyard period from 26 April to 16 May at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel. She returned to provide coastal defense in the Elbe on 27 May. On 4 July 1915, following the loss of the <a href="Minelayer">minelaying</a> cruiser in the Baltic, the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area. Additionally, the army requested naval support for the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Niemen">Army of the Niemen</a>, which was operating in <a href="Courland">Courland</a>. On 7–11 and 18–19 July, German cruisers, with the IV Squadron ships in support, conducted sweeps in the Baltic, though without engaging any Russian forces. During the latter operation, "Elsass" collided with the torpedo boat , though she inflicted only minor damage.

In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> of Russian naval forces to assist the German Army then advancing on the city. The IV Squadron was joined by the I Squadron, which consisted of the eight and s, from the High Seas Fleet, as well as three <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s and many smaller craft. The task force was commanded by "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>, though operational command remained with Schmidt. On the morning of 8 August, the German fleet made its initial push into the Gulf. "Elsass" and "Braunschweig" were assigned to attack the Russian pre-dreadnought to prevent her from disrupting the German minesweepers. The German vessels engaged "Slava" and the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> at long range without result. When it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall, Schmidt called off the attempt. A second attempt was made on 16 August. "Elsass" remained outside the Gulf, while the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s and dealt with "Slava". By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. However, reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the German fleet to call off the operation the following day.

After the operation, "Elsass" remained in <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>, and the IV Squadron was disbanded on 18 December. While in Libau, "Elsass" briefly served as the <a href="command%20ship">command ship</a> for "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Friedrich%20Schultz">Friedrich Schultz</a>, the "Befehlshaber der Aufklärungsschiffe der Ostsee" (Commander of Reconnaissance Forces in the Baltic), from January to March 1916. By that time, "Braunschweig", which had been modified in Kiel to serve as Schultz's command ship, arrived to relieve "Elsass". Crew shortages forced the navy to reduce both ships' crews, to the point that they were only capable of providing local defense of the harbor. On 10 July, "Elsass" was transferred back to Kiel, where four days later her crew was transferred to her sister . "Elsass" was taken into the shipyard in Kiel for repairs before returning to service on 25 July as a stationary <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> assigned to the I Marine Inspectorate. She remained in Kiel until her decommissioning on 20 June 1918. The ship underwent an overhaul and returned to training duty in October, though Germany surrendered the following month.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the older ""Deutschland" or "Lothringen" class." "Elsass" was kept and used as a training ship in the German fleet, which was renamed the "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>". In 1923, the aging ship underwent a major overhaul. "Elsass" was dry-docked in the <a href="Kriegsmarinewerft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Reichsmarinewerft"</a> in Wilhelmshaven, where the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was rebuilt. Work was completed the following year. She was recommissioned on 15 February 1924 with a partial crew. Assigned to the "Linienschiffsdivision" (Battleship Division) of the "Seestreitkräfte der Nordsee" (Naval Forces of the North Sea) and based in Wilhelmshaven, the ship received her full crew by 1 April. In July, she joined the rest of the fleet for a major training cruise in the Atlantic, which included a stop in <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>, Spain, from 6 to 13 July. In 1925, "Elsass" and the battleship visited <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, Norway, from 19 to 24 June, though "Elsass" proceeded alone to <a href="Odda%20%28town%29">Odda</a>, where she stayed from 26 to 30 June.

On 1 October, the ship was transferred to the "Seestreitkräfte der Ostsee" (Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea), which was based in Kiel. The fleet went on another major cruise in the Atlantic and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> in May and June 1926; during the trip "Elsass" made calls in several Spanish ports, including <a href="Mah%C3%B3n">Mahón</a>, <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, and Vigo. Another cruise followed the next year in April and May, with stops in <a href="Vilagarc%C3%ADa%20de%20Arousa">Vilagarcía</a>, Spain, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Vicente%2C%20Madeira">São Vicente, Madeira</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a> and <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20La%20Palma">Santa Cruz de La Palma</a> in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, <a href="Horta%2C%20Azores">Horta</a> and <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, and <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Portugal. In 1928, "Elsass" made visits to <a href="Ulvik">Ulvik</a> and <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> in Norway in July, and <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a>, Denmark, in September. The winter of 1928–1929 proved to be especially cold, and "Elsass" and the battleship were pressed into service as <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a>s; the two ships helped to free 65 merchant ships from the heavy ice. In March 1929, "Elsass" also performed icebreaking duties off <a href="Gedser">Gedser</a>, Denmark.

The fleet went on another Atlantic cruise in April 1929, and "Elsass" made calls in Villagarcia and <a href="A%20Pobra%20do%20Carami%C3%B1al">A Pobra do Caramiñal</a>, Spain. That fall, the ship visited <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a>, Sweden. "Elsass" was withdrawn from active service on 25 February 1930. She was stricken from the naval register on 31 March 1931 and served as a <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> in Wilhelmshaven until 31 October 1935, when the "Reichsmarine" sold her to "Technischer Betrieb des <a href="Norddeutscher%20Lloyd">Norddeutscher Lloyd</a>". "Elsass" was broken up for scrap the following year.

Ross Perot 1992 presidential campaign

<a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">In 1992</a>, <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a> ran unsuccessfully as an <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent candidate</a> for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. Perot, a <a href="Texas">Texas</a> industrialist, had never served as a public official but had experience as the head of several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve <a href="ballot%20access">ballot access</a> following his announcement on the February 20, 1992 edition of "<a href="Larry%20King%20Live">Larry King Live</a>". <a href="James%20Stockdale">James Stockdale</a>, a retired <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">vice admiral</a>, was Perot's <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice presidential</a> <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a>.

Perot focused the campaign on his plans to balance the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20budget">federal budget</a>, further <a href="economic%20nationalism">economic nationalism</a>, strengthen the <a href="war%20on%20drugs">war on drugs</a> and implement "electronic town halls" throughout the nation for <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a>. His views were described as a combination of "<a href="East%20Texas">East Texas</a> populism with high-tech wizardry." Supporters saw Perot as a nonpolitical and witty "folk hero", but critics described the candidate as "authoritarian" and "short-tempered".

Perot largely financed his own campaign and relied on marketing and wide grassroots support. In certain polls, Perot led the three-way race with <a href="Republican%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> nominee <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, the incumbent President, and then-<a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">Governor</a> <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee. He dropped out in July 1992 amid controversy, but re-entered in October, participating in all three <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20debates">presidential debates</a>. Despite an aggressive use of campaign <a href="infomercial">infomercial</a>s on <a href="prime%20time">prime time</a> <a href="Big%20Three%20television%20networks">network television</a>, his polling numbers never fully recovered from his initial exit. On <a href="Election%20Day%20%28politics%29">Election Day</a>, Perot appeared on every state ballot as a result of the earlier draft efforts. He won several counties, finished in second place in two states, and finished in third place overall, receiving close to 18.97 percent of the popular vote, the most won by a <a href="Third%20party%20%28United%20States%29">third-party</a> presidential candidate since <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201912">1912</a>. A 1999 study in the "<a href="American%20Journal%20of%20Political%20Science">American Journal of Political Science</a>" estimated that Perot's candidacy hurt the Clinton campaign, reducing "Clinton's margin of victory over Bush by seven percentage points."

Ross Perot had never been elected to public office, but he ran several successful corporations and was involved in public affairs for decades. After serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in the 1950s, Perot joined <a href="IBM">IBM</a> as a salesman. He surpassed his one-year sales quota in just two weeks. After the company ignored his idea for electronic storage, he founded <a href="Electronic%20Data%20Systems">Electronic Data Systems</a> in 1962, which was then contracted by the United States government to store <a href="Medicare%20%28United%20States%29">Medicare</a> records. Perot earned a fortune with the company, and by 1968 was named by "<a href="Fortune%20magazine">Fortune</a>" as the "fastest, richest Texan." Perot was known to run the company in a militaristic fashion, built on loyalty and duty. His best known venture with the company was in 1979, when he sent a private militia into <a href="Iran">Iran</a> in the midst of the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a> to rescue two of his employees who had been imprisoned. The episode inspired the 1983 novel, "<a href="On%20Wings%20of%20Eagles">On Wings of Eagles</a>". Perot eventually sold his company to <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> in 1984 for $2.55 billion, and founded <a href="Perot%20Systems">Perot Systems</a> in 1988. By 1992, his fortune was judged to be $3 billion.

Perot was a <a href="War%20hawk">hawk</a> on the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, an advocate for U.S. servicemen held as prisoner of war and a supporter for their families. During the war, he aided soldiers by providing supplies and holding rallies for those returning home. In public affairs, he led the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 at the behest of Republican <a href="Governor%20of%20Texas">Governor</a> <a href="Bill%20Clements">Bill Clements</a>, and was put in charge of the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor <a href="Mark%20White">Mark White</a>. Perot's most dear political effort involved the <a href="Vietnam%20War%20POW/MIA%20issue">Vietnam War POW/MIA issue</a>. He worked extensively to free soldiers that he believed had been left behind, and even engaged in secret diplomatic talks with the Vietnamese government, to the chagrin of the Reagan White House. Perot had been supportive of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and labeled him as a "great president" in 1986. He even pledged $2.5 million to support his <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Presidential%20Library">presidential library</a>, but the relationship soured after Perot was sent on a trip to Hanoi, and determined afterwards that the administration was not taking the POW/MIA issue seriously. He revoked his pledge to the library in 1987, based on the POW/MIA issue as well as his disillusionment from the administration's actions during the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Contra%20affair">Iran–Contra affair</a>. He became a critic of the George H. W. Bush administration, and opposed the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>.

Ross Perot appeared on the February 20 edition of "Larry King Live" on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991. After a lively interview concerning political issues, King directly asked Perot if there was "any scenario in which [he] would run for president." Perot firmly stated that he did not want to run, but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if "ordinary people" signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states. He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an "action man ... who can get things done ... [and who] takes care of his people". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on . The "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" speculated that Perot's "iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics" would appeal to the "angry frustrated electorate". But Republican consultant <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a> characterized Perot as an "untested wild man". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 <a href="National%20Press%20Club%20%28USA%29">National Press Club</a> speech, which aired on <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a>.

"<a href="Draft%20%28politics%29">Draft</a> Perot" organizations opened throughout the nation, and petition drives were coordinated largely by Perot's friend Tom Luce, and the real estate arm of Perot Systems, to help secure a place for the candidate on every state ballot. At the height of the efforts, 18,000 simultaneous calls came into Perot's telephone banks after he appeared on the "<a href="Phil%20Donahue%20Show">Phil Donahue Show</a>". At one point, 30,000 telephone calls were received in one hour. MCI Communications Corporation reported that over a million calls came in during the first ten days that the phone banks were active. At the time, presidential polls showed Perot with 21% support from the electorate, 14 points behind likely Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton and 16 points behind President Bush. Despite this, only one third of potential voters knew enough about Perot to form an opinion of him. A large segment of his support came from <a href="Reagan%20Democrat">Reagan Democrat</a>s, entrepreneurs and suburban conservatives deemed "Perot Republicans", who agreed with the central theme of his campaign, though they disagreed with his <a href="pro-choice">pro-choice</a> stance on abortion. Political newcomers were also involved in the volunteer efforts.

Twenty-five states required that a presidential candidate have a running mate to appear on the ballot. As a result, Perot named retired Vice Admiral <a href="James%20B.%20Stockdale">James B. Stockdale</a>, who had been awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his actions during  years of captivity as a POW during the Vietnam War, as his "interim" running mate in late March. Stockdale would remain in the position throughout the campaign. A "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" report suggested that <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> President <a href="John%20Silber">John Silber</a> was also considered as a running mate. During an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> interview in April, Perot commented that he might begin a campaign before his supporters achieved ballot access in all states. In New York, ballot access appeared to be the most difficult to attain. In a five-week summer period, the campaign would be required to compile 20,000 signatures from non-primary voters, including 100 from each of half of the state's Congressional districts. Perot conceded that he might not appear on the state's ballot, but stated that he may run anyway.

Throughout April, the draft efforts continued, and Perot appeared on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During an appearance on "Larry King Live", Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, and that he was willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">Today Show</a>" he was interviewed by <a href="Katie%20Couric">Katie Couric</a>, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for "people who don't need it". He appeared on "<a href="Face%20the%20Nation">Face the Nation</a>" later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by <a href="Tim%20Russert">Tim Russert</a> on "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>", during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without "political pros" to avoid the "dirty tricks" of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant <a href="Raymond%20Strother">Raymond Strother</a> explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster <a href="Mark%20Penn">Mark Penn</a> were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" editor <a href="James%20Squires">James Squires</a> as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.

By May, Perot was leading presidential polls in both Texas and California. The <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush%231992%20presidential%20campaign">Bush</a> and <a href="Bill%20Clinton%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201992">Clinton campaign</a>s became concerned about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his "folk hero status" to that of a politician, by highlighting his "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired <a href="John%20P.%20White">John P. White</a>, who served as a budget official under President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> to decide the presidency. Around this time, <a href="Hal%20Riney">Hal Riney</a>, who had worked on <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s 1984 campaign and was known for the "<a href="Morning%20in%20America">Morning in America</a>" ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly "flipped out", and asked "Why would I spend that when I could go on the <a href="The%20Today%20Show">'Today' show</a> for free?" Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.

Although he did not campaign or advertise, Perot won a large share of the vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> in mid-May. In the Oregon primary, he was <a href="Write-in%20candidate">written-in</a> by 13% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans. <a href="Exit%20poll">Exit poll</a>ing showed Perot's favorability at or above that of Clinton and Bush in their respective party's primaries. At the end of May, Perot called on Bush to "climb in the ring", claiming that the President was using surrogates to attack him. To strengthen his own team, Perot's campaign interviewed Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign manager and <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="Hamilton%20Jordan">Hamilton Jordan</a> and <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign</a> manager <a href="Ed%20Rollins">Ed Rollins</a> to fill a position in the campaign. Eventually, both were hired as co-campaign managers. On May 29, Perot ended his talk show hiatus after talking with <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a> on "<a href="20/20%20%28US%20television%20show%29">20/20</a>". He discussed his three-part plan for balancing the budget, starting with a Congressional act to limit spending, followed by a cut in government waste, of which he would be more specific in coming weeks, and a reform of the existing tax system. During the interview, Perot also stated that he would avoid adding <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>s to his cabinet to prevent "a point of controversy with the American people". However, he commented that "what people do in their private lives is their business."

Former <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> pollster <a href="Frank%20Luntz">Frank Luntz</a> was hired by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee chairman <a href="Charles%20Leonard">Charles Leonard</a>. The "New York Times" reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time Magazine</a>" poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President <a href="Dan%20Quayle">Dan Quayle</a> became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a "temperamental tycoon".

Perot campaigned in California in mid-June, and held a rally attended by 7,000 in <a href="Sacramento">Sacramento</a> where he was heckled by some who chanted "Talk about the issues!" He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the <a href="1992%20Los%20Angeles%20riots">L.A. race riots</a>; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not take a stand on <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a>. Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At the end of the month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of "well dressed, middle aged" individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

In July, some of Perot's past actions, including a private investigation of the <a href="Bush%20family">Bush family</a> in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a "Republican research team" and claimed that he was warned that since he had such a "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried to come up with a new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> head Dr. <a href="Bernadine%20Healy">Bernadine Healy</a> as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a> group, demanding that he address <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow <a href="gay">gay</a>s to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s as "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the <a href="New%20Black%20Panther%20Party">New Black Panther Party</a> were plotting his assassination.

By mid-July, the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign <a href="loyalty%20oath">loyalty oath</a>s. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan</a> campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the <a href="CIA">CIA</a>. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on "Larry King Live" that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> to decide the election if the result caused the <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed <a href="United%20We%20Stand%20America">United We Stand</a> to "influence the debate." At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. <a href="Bill%20Hillsman">Bill Hillsman</a>, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.

Former advisors commented that Perot, who had achieved ballot access in 24 states, was unwilling "to spend money on things that mattered" including Rollins' and Jordan's proposed $150 million advertising campaign, was "obsessed" with his image, and lost interest in running after receiving negative press. Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that "the tears have not stopped." A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida to force him to remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that Perot's campaign had been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported his economic plan, but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss his economic plan, which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively.

On October 1, Perot re-entered the presidential race, with a desire to further explain his economic plans to the American people. The "New York Times" commented that Perot's "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: "he wanted to do it just like he could go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed "political amateurs" whose loyalty was unquestioned. <a href="Orson%20Swindle">Orson Swindle</a>, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.

Perot employed a massive marketing strategy, spending $34.8 million to buy half hour and hour segments on major television networks, memorably using charts to illustrate his ideas for the economy. His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that "We got into <a href="trickle-down%20economics">trickle-down economics</a> and it didn't trickle." He later concluded that "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody steps up to the plate and accepts responsibility for anything." He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled "Red Flag" displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: "While the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> is ending another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of <a href="Communism">Communism</a>, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams." A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9.

Perot participated in the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Missouri">Clayton, Missouri</a>, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It was the first time that a third party candidate was involved in a national televised debate since <a href="John%20B.%20Anderson">John B. Anderson</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201980">1980</a>, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a>s. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing <a href="Lawrence%20Welk">Lawrence Welk</a> music here tonight." After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a> and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, "Who am I? Why am I here?" He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.

The second presidential debate was held on October 15 in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, and included questions from undecided voters, who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained that there was a "<a href="giant%20sucking%20sound">giant sucking sound</a>" caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as "results ... [and] action oriented", and explained that "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." Perot took part in the third debate held in <a href="East%20Lansing%2C%20Michigan">East Lansing, Michigan</a>, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 million of his own money to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of <a href="gotcha%20journalism">"gotcha" stories</a> and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away."

Following the debates, Perot did not campaign and was not seen on television until later in the week when ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. The spot cost Perot $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled "The Ross Perot Nobody Knows", and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of "<a href="Monday%20Night%20Football">Monday Night Football</a>", which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to urge them to perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser <a href="James%20Oberwetter">James Oberwetter</a>, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" that "Republican operatives" also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the <a href="FBI">FBI</a>, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man "who was willing to give up his goal to protect his family"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism.

By the end of October, Perot had reached 20% in opinion polls, and his favorability ratings slightly increased. But as reports detailed Perot's investigation of campaign volunteers and the prior use of "loyalty oaths", the numbers remained stagnant. Aides hoped to shift the focus of the campaign and media reports back to the economy. Perot appeared on "Larry King Live" later in the week and opined that the <a href="early%201990s%20recession">early 1990s recession</a> was not over "because of <a href="deficit%20spending">deficit spending</a> and competition for money". He was also interviewed on "Talking with David Frost", where he affirmed a statement made by his running mate that the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> protests had prolonged the war effort. In the final days, it was estimated that Perot spent $5 million a day on advertisements. Overall, he had spent $40 million in October alone, and $60 million during the course of the campaign.

In the lead up to Election Day, Perot attended a few rallies in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="Denver">Denver</a>. A major rally was staged in <a href="Tampa">Tampa</a>, and was attended by more than 10,000 supporters. Perot also made stops in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Santa%20Clara%2C%20California">Santa Clara</a>. On the final night, infomercials aired on all three major networks. He held his final campaign event in Dallas outside his headquarters, and thanked his supporters, stating: "What you've been through hasn't been pretty, but by golly, you're taking your country back." At the end, his campaign song "<a href="Crazy%20%28Willie%20Nelson%20song%29">Crazy</a>" by <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a> was played. In the final <a href="NBC">NBC</a>-"<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" poll, Perot was in third place with 15%, behind Bush with 36% and Clinton with 44%.

On Election Day, Perot finished in third place behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% of the vote in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and 27% in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> (divided into <a href="List%20of%20boroughs%20and%20census%20areas%20in%20Alaska">boroughs</a>), <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. He won his largest percentage in <a href="Matanuska-Susitna%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska</a> and <a href="Loving%20County%2C%20Texas">Loving County, Texas</a> with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.

Perot's performance satisfied the 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar <a href="Walter%20Dean%20Burnham">Walter Dean Burnham</a>. The legitimacy of this success has been questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, largely due to the availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the <a href="wasted%20vote">wasted vote</a> mindset.

The effect of <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a>'s candidacy has been a contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a <a href="spoiler%20effect">spoiler</a>, enough to the detriment of Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important," two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.
A mathematical look at the voting numbers reveals that Bush would have had to win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as <a href="abortion">abortion</a> and <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a>.

A 1999 study in the "American Journal of Political Science" estimated that Perot's candidacy hurt the Clinton campaign, reducing "Clinton's margin of victory over Bush by seven percentage point."

After the election, Perot continued to work with "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA). In 1993, he was involved in a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on "Larry King Live" over NAFTA. Perot formed the <a href="Reform%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Reform Party of the United States of America</a> in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler <a href="Jesse%20Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a>, was elected as <a href="Governor%20of%20Minnesota">Governor of Minnesota</a> in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. Perot declined to run in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 presidential election</a>, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> for the presidency, and stated "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now ... if ever there was a time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now." The members of the <a href="populism">populist</a> <a href="Tea%20Party%20movement">Tea Party movement</a> have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.

Operation Camargue

Operation Camargue was one of the largest operations by the <a href="French%20Far%20East%20Expeditionary%20Corps">French Far East Expeditionary Corps</a> and <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> in the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>. It took place from 28 July until 10 August 1953. French <a href="Tank">armored platoons</a>, <a href="paratrooper">airborne units</a> and troops delivered by <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> to the coast of central <a href="Annam%20%28French%20protectorate%29">Annam</a>, modern-day <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, attempted to sweep forces of the <a href="communism">communist</a> <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> from the critical <a href="National%20Route%201A%20%28Vietnam%29">Route One</a>.

The first landings took place in the early morning on 28 July, and reached the first objectives, an inland canal, without major incident. A secondary phase of mopping-up operations began in a "labyrinth of tiny villages" where French armored forces suffered a series of ambushes. Reinforced by <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s, the French and their Vietnamese allies tightened a net around the defending Viet Minh, but delays in the movement of French forces left gaps through which most of the Viet Minh guerillas, and many of the arms caches the operation was expected to seize, escaped. For the French, this validated the claim that it was impossible to operate tight ensnaring operations in Vietnam's jungle, due to the slow movement of their troops, and a foreknowledge by the enemy, which was difficult to prevent. From then on, the French focused on creating strong fortified positions, against which Viet Minh <a href="V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p">General Giáp</a> could pit his forces, culminating in <a href="Operation%20Castor">Operation Castor</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a>.

With the French forces withdrawn from the operation by the late summer of 1953, Viet Minh Regiment 95 re-infiltrated Route One and resumed ambushes of French convoys, retrieving weapons caches missed by the French forces. Regiment 95 occupied the area for the remainder of the First Indochina War and were still operating there as late as 1962 against the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">South Vietnamese Army</a> during the Second Indochina, or <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

The First Indochina War had raged, as <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, since 19 December 1946. From 1949, it evolved into <a href="conventional%20warfare">conventional warfare</a>, due largely to aid from the communists of the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> ("PRC") to the north. Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, started failing. Thanks to the terrain, popular support for <a href="August%20Revolution">August Revolution</a> and support for <a href="decolonization">decolonization</a> from bordering China and the U.S.S.R., the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a "clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army", following <a href="On%20Guerrilla%20Warfare">asymmetric warfare theory laid by Mao Tse Tung</a>, something which previously had never been encountered by the western <a href="colonialism">colonial</a> powers. In October 1952, fighting around the <a href="Red%20River%20Delta">Red River Delta</a> spread into the <a href="Thai%20Highlands">Thai Highlands</a>, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%A0%20S%E1%BA%A3n">Battle of Nà Sản</a>, at which the Viet Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at Nà Sản – strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma Campaign</a> – as the basis for their new strategy. The Viet Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam, and the French "could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a roadbound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests".

In May 1953, <a href="Henri%20Navarre">General Henri Navarre</a> arrived to take command of the French forces, replacing <a href="Raoul%20Salan">General Raoul Salan</a>. Navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in Indochina – based on strong, fast-moving forces – and the media quickly took Operation Camargue to be the "practical realization" of that.

Following the Communist victory in the <a href="Chinese%20Civil%20War">Chinese Civil War</a> in 1949, the Viet Minh established close ties with China. It enabled the Chinese to expand their area of influence into Indochina and the Viet Minh to receive much-needed Chinese equipment and strategic planning support. From mid-1950, PRC military advisers were seconded to the Viet Minh at battalion, regimental and divisional levels. The common border meant that "China became a 'sanctuary' where the Viet Minh could be trained and refitted". When the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out, Indochina became "an important pawn in Cold War strategy". In December 1950, the United States, concerned about growing Chinese Communist influence, started providing military aid to the French, with a first payment of US$15 million.

In the spring of 1953, the Viet Minh launched campaigns in Laos and succeeded in linking up Laotian territorial gains with their bases in north-western Vietnam. Meanwhile, the winding down of the Korean War meant that China was able "to give much more attention to its southern neighbour". Similarly, the US "released from its heavy burden in the Korean conflict ... dramatically increased its military and financial support" to the French. By June 1953, the US "had sent: 1,224 tanks and combat vehicles; 120,792 rifles and machine guns; more than 200 million rifle and machine gun cartridges; more than five million artillery projectiles; 302 boats and 304 aircraft" (by end of the war, total US aid amounted to nearly four billion dollars).

<a href="National%20Route%201A%20%28Vietnam%29">Route One</a>, also known as Route Coloniale One (or RC1), had been the main north–south artery along the coastline of Vietnam since the outbreak of violence in 1949. Communications and convoys along these lines suffered from regular attacks by Viet Minh irregulars, despite efforts by the French during 1952 in Operation Sauterelle. The Viet Minh paramilitary forces around Route One originated mainly from a region of fortified villages dispersed along <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s and <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es between <a href="Hu%C3%A9">Hué</a> to the south, and <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Tr%E1%BB%8B%20Province">Quang Tri</a> to the north. French forces had suffered from Viet Minh ambushes, an attack that the latter had become very proficient at throughout the war, most notably in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Route%20Coloniale%204">annihilation of Group Mobile 42</a> in 1950 and of <a href="Battle%20of%20Mang%20Yang%20Pass">GM 100</a> in 1954. The roads in Vietnam were almost all closed during the night and "abandoned to the enemy".
Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored vehicles were destroyed, 84% of them from mines and <a href="booby%20trap">booby trap</a>s. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying the first and last vehicles of the halted convoy with <a href="land%20mine">remote mines</a>. <a href="Caltrop">Caltrop</a>s, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> and <a href="recoilless%20rifle">recoilless rifle</a>s were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Route One, which led to its French nickname of "la rue sans joie" ("the <a href="Street%20Without%20Joy">Street Without Joy</a>"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in <a href="Th%E1%BB%ABa%20Thi%C3%AAn">Thừa Thiên</a> just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.

By early summer 1953, thanks in part to the wind-down of hostilities in the Korean War, the French command had "sufficient reserves" at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Route One. They assembled 30 battalions, two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of the largest operations of the conflict. Called Operation Camargue, it was named for the <a href="Camargue">sandy marshland</a> to the west of <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, France. The difficult terrain was to prove the decisive factor and gave a major advantage to the one Viet Minh regiment tasked with defending Route One.

From a deep beach of "hard sand" the French landing forces were to advance through a series of dunes. The dunes were up to high and interspersed with precipices, ditches and a handful of small villages. Beyond this was an belt of <a href="pagoda">pagoda</a>s and temples, which war correspondent Bernard Fall described as having excellent defensive potential. Beyond these temples was Route One itself with a series of closely packed and fortified villages, including Tân An, Mỹ Thủy, Van Trinh and Lai-Ha. This network of villages and hedgerows made both ground and air surveillance difficult. Across from Route One the villages continued amid an area of <a href="quicksand">quicksand</a>, swamps and bogs, which would stop all but a few of the vehicles at the disposal of the French. Although there were roads, most were mined or damaged. Throughout the area, the civilian population remained and provided a further complication for the French high command.

The French divided their forces into four "groupement mobiles" ("mobile groups"): A through D. Group A consisted of Mobile Group 14, which contained 3rd Amphibious Group, 2nd Marine Commando, 2nd Battalion 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, and 3rd Vietnamese Parachute Battalion. Operation Camargue was to be one of the final proving grounds for the use of French armour during the war. It was to land on the beach in line with the center of Route One. Meanwhile, Group B was to advance over land from the west of the north-east facing beach. This group consisted of Mobile Group Central Vietnam's <a href="6th%20Moroccan%20Spahis">6th Moroccan Spahis</a>, 2nd Amphibious Group, a tank platoon from <a href="1st%20Foreign%20Cavalry%20Regiment">1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment</a>, and two infantry companies from the Quang-Tri military base. Group C was to advance from the south-west into the back of Van Trinh through the swamps, and consisted of the 9th Moroccan <a href="Tabor%20%28Morocco%29">Tabor</a>, 27th Vietnamese Infantry Battalion, 2nd Battalion of the <a href="4th%20Moroccan%20Rifle%20Regiment">4th Moroccan Rifle Regiment</a>, 1 Commando, a tank platoon of the Moroccan Colonials, an armoured patrol boat platoon, and an <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Mechanized">LCM</a> platoon. Group D consisted of 3rd Battalion of the <a href="3rd%20Algerian%20Rifles">3rd Algerian Rifles</a>, the 7th Amphibious Group, and a commando group, and was to land at the south-east end of the beach, below Group A. These forces in total formed "two amphibious forces, three land-borne groupments and one airborne force" all of which was commanded by General Leblanc.

On 27 July 1953, the French landing craft departed from their assembly points, and by 04:00 on the following had begun disembarking 160 amphibious landing craft belonging to Group A's 3rd Amphibious opposite the coastline. By 06:00, these vehicles had <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">landed on the beach</a> and proceeded to occupy sand ridges overlooking the dunes beyond. Proceeding into the dunes, the vehicles of 3rd Amphibious became stuck in the sand; in the meantime, other regular infantry elements of Group A were experiencing more difficulties in the sea, taking two extra hours to reach the beach. Thus unsupported, elements of 3rd Amphibious that either disembarked floundering vehicles or were pushed, managed to escape the dunes and advance between Tân An and Mỹ Thủy. The French amphibious vehicles were the World War II-era <a href="M29%20Weasel">29-C</a> cargo carriers, nicknamed the "crab" or ""crabe"" and <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">LVT</a> 4 or 4As, known as "alligators". The latter were armed with two and two <a href="Browning%20machine%20gun">Browning machine gun</a>s and an <a href="M20%20recoilless%20rifle">M20 recoilless rifle</a>. While the alligators were sufficiently armoured and well suited to the water, they struggled on land. In contrast, the crab had difficulty in water and its large size presented too great a target on land; however, it was lighter and more maneuverable, except in paddy fields where its suspension became clogged with vegetation.

While Group A's forward elements were breaching the dune barrier unopposed, two of Group B's battalions crossed the Van Trịnh Cănal. By 07:45, when they made visual contact with the crabs and alligators of Group A, they had succeeded in sealing off the northern escape route of By 08:30, the 6th Moroccan Spahis also reached the canal, having had difficulty crossing the swamps on the landward side with their <a href="M24%20Chaffee">M24 Chaffee</a> tanks. No French units, as yet, had made any major contact with the Viet Minh. A minor fire-fight had taken place on the southern edge of advance when an Algerian company exchanged fire with 20–30 Viet Minh and suffered the first French fatalities. Simultaneously, had advanced into the center of the area of operation, and executed "the most complicated maneuver of the operation". This involved crossing Route One and sealing off the land side of the operational area, and was completed by 08:30.

Group D, finally, was tasked with advancing south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between the sea and an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.

With the landings and the encirclement of Regiment 95 complete and the net deemed secure, the French forces began the second phase of the operation and began to sweep through the area for the encircled Viet Minh. Each French group began to move through the villages around Route One in an attempt to locate the Viet Minh forces. Group B, which was lined up along the canal – the jump-off point for the second phase of the operation – moved to sweep the northern villages while Group C did the same further south. The method of searching each village was to seal it off entirely with encircling troops, and then inspect it with a heavily armed unit of <a href="Demining">minesweepers</a> and <a href="War%20dog">K-9</a> teams. Men of military age were arrested and screened by <a href="intelligence%20officer">intelligence officer</a>s. This process was time-consuming, and by 11:00 Group B had traveled through the network of villages with no results or resistance. At this time, the 6th Moroccan Spahis entered the village of Dong-Qué with their M-24 tanks and the support of the 1st Battalion of the Moroccan Rifles and the artillery of Colonel Piroth (later commander of the artillery at the battle of Dien Bien Phu) and his 69th African Artillery Regiment.
The Moroccan infantry took the lead, and the French commanders sealed themselves in their tank turrets and advanced behind. Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence. The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding <a href="rice%20paddy">rice paddies</a>, and the <a href="bazooka">bazooka</a>s of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks. The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué "disintegrated under the impact of their high-angle fire", particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot. As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards the southern end of the French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué.

Group C's 9th Tabor had also, like the M-24s of Group B, struggled through the marshes during the first phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee <a href="Non-commissioned%20officer">NCOs</a> and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the <a href="pincer%20movement">pincer movement</a> was complete.

By 17:30, with Phu-An captured, all French reserves now committed, and one half of the pocket fully swept by groups B and A at the northern end of the battlefield, the French appeared to have gained the upper hand. By now, the expected windfall of arms caches and prisoners should have taken place. However, the unexpected time taken to capture Phu-An, and the delayed arrival of the paratroop reinforcements who had been scattered by the winds, had left a gap between Phu-An and the southern edge of the lagoon. This gap was eventually covered by only four French battalions, leaving gaps through which the Viet Minh could escape. Crabs and alligators were stationed on, or in some cases in, the canal network, and French infantry were scattered across the edge of the pocket throughout that night in order to detect escaping Viet Minh. However, despite the occasional shot, flare and searchlight, no Viet Minh were detected.

On the morning of 29 July 1953, the French forces continued to advance into the remaining pocket, encountering neither Viet Minh nor civilian. Groups A, B and D reached the edge of the canal opposite Group C by 13:00, having retrieved a small number of suspected Viet Minh and a "few weapons". At this time, however, a <a href="Morane-Saulnier">Morane</a> aircraft detected the movement of elements of Regiment 95 towards An-Hoi on the extreme northern corner of the operational area, outside of the pocket. The French carried out a raid on An-Hoi by commando groups and elements of Group A, which took place at 15:00 and returned with suspected Viet Minh by 18:00. The French then undertook a methodical house-to-house search of the entire area, sweeping each village, and the surrounding paddy fields and jungle, risking encounter with Viet Minh caltrops. Meanwhile, 2nd and 3rd amphibious used their crabs and alligators to herd prisoners towards Trung-An for interrogation. By the end of 29 July, with resistance to the French forces having ceased, a general withdrawal of paratroopers, amphibious groups and marines began.

After the departure of all but regular French infantry, efforts to make the area suitable for permanent occupation by French forces and French-friendly civilians began. This involved the rebuilding of road and rail links (<a href="North%E2%80%93South%20Railway%20%28Vietnam%29">Vietnam's North–South railway</a> ran alongside Route One), the repairing of infrastructure, demining, the installation of new Vietnamese government administrators, and the provision of "everything from rice to anti-malaria tablets". Over 24 villages were placed under the authority of the Vietnamese government, and Regiment 95 had been driven from the area. In comparison to Fall, South Vietnamese general <a href="L%C3%A2m%20Quang%20Thi">Lâm Quang Thi</a> states in his memoirs that Operation Camargue was "one of the most successful French military operations during the Indochina war" in the area of Route One.

Newspapers stated that the operation had been a "total success, demonstrating once more the new aggressiveness and mobility" of the French forces. However, in the days following the end of the fighting, press reports on the French failure to capture the anticipated large numbers of Viet Minh began to appear though the British newspaper, "The Times", did publish claimed casualty figures of 1,550 for the Viet Minh, 200 of which were killed. This estimate was altered by the French the next day to 600 killed or wounded and 900 captured, and it was suggested that the operation did "not appear to have been successful". In contrast to these figures, Bernard Fall records 182 Viet Minh casualties and 387 prisoners. He also notes that "51 rifles, eight sub-machine guns, two mortars, and five BARs" were captured. Of the prisoners, however, it is not recorded how many were confirmed to be members of Regiment 95. Both Fall and the newspapers published in the days following the official termination of the operation on 10 August 1953, give French casualties as 17 dead and 100 wounded. Giáp wrote "it was announced we suffered heavy losses although in fact our losses were insignificant ... their troops had to withdraw with heavy losses".

Fall goes on to record that the "major defect" of Operation Camargue was that the French had nothing like the numerical superiority to encircle a force in the terrain around Road One, 15:1 as opposed to the 20:1 or 25:1 that he believed required. He states that the slow French progress (around 1,500 yards an hour) and the large distances each unit had to guard from Viet Minh infiltration meant that the Viet Minh could easily escape the net. He also states that Viet Minh intelligence were always aware of French movements, as the size of French units and the complex technology involved in the operation gave its presence and intentions away almost immediately, whereas in contrast the simpler Viet Minh operations were far more difficult to detect.

Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue and resumed ambushes in 1954, as well as assaulting a Vietnamese garrison near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giáp's 1954 campaign season, until Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam by the cease-fire, whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Route One during broad daylight, leaving small cells of guerillas in the area. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962.

He died at <a href="Wyrallah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wyrallah</a>, New South Wales, in 1978.

Reginald George Pollard was born on 20 January 1903 in <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, New South Wales, the third son of Albert Edgar Pollard, an English accountant, and his Australian wife Thalia Rebecca, née McLean. Schooled in Bathurst, Reg entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1921, and graduated with the <a href="Sword%20of%20Honour%20%28Duntroon%29">Sword of Honour</a> for "exemplary conduct and performance" in 1924. Pollard and fellow graduate <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, winner of the <a href="King%27s%20Medal%20%28Duntroon%29">King's Medal</a> and future <a href="air%20chief%20marshal">air chief marshal</a>, applied to transfer to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) under a scheme designed to augment the RAAF's officer corps, but only Scherger was accepted. The previous year, Pollard and Scherger had inaugurated a Duntroon tradition when they found a horse's jawbone during a field exercise. Inspired by the Biblical tale in which <a href="Samson">Samson</a> slays the <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a> with the jawbone of an ass, they declared their find a lucky charm and brought it back to the college as a mascot; it became known as "Enobesra" (reportedly because "jawbone seemed so commonplace, an <a href="buttocks">arsebone</a> sounded much more interesting and spelt backwards sounded both mysterious and respectable").

Ranked <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>/<a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> of the <a href="17th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">17th Battalion</a> <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">(Citizens Military Forces)</a>, headquartered at <a href="North%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Sydney</a>, in July 1925. He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a typist, at St Andrew's Anglican Church, <a href="Strathfield">Strathfield</a>, on 31 October; "<a href="The%20Bathurst%20Free%20Press%20and%20Mining%20Journal">The Bathurst Times</a>" reported that Daisy cut the cake with her husband's Sword of Honour. Pollard departed for India on attachment to the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in September 1927, serving with the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a> and the <a href="York%20and%20Lancaster%20Regiment">York and Lancaster Regiment</a>.

In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>. Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936. He was transferred to Army Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, in October 1936. His next posting, in July 1938, was as General Staff Officer Grade 3, Training and General Duties, at the 2nd District Base, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. In November 1938, Pollard travelled to England to attend <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>; he graduated in September 1939, the planned two-year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War.

Following the declaration of war, Pollard served as Assistant Military Liaison Officer at the <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%2C%20London">Australian High Commission</a>, London; during this posting he spent two weeks attached to the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> in France. Promoted <a href="major">major</a>, he joined the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) in June 1940. The provisions of the "Defence Act (1903)" prohibited members of the PMF or the CMF fighting outside Australian territory except as volunteers in the AIF. Pollard was appointed <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> of the <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th Brigade</a>, an Australian infantry formation raised in England mostly from logistics personnel to help combat a possible invasion by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. The brigade became part of the Australian <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a>, and in January 1941 sailed for the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>; it was transferred to the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> on arrival.

In March 1941, Pollard was assigned to the 7th Division's headquarters staff in Libya under Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a>.

A cease-fire on 12 July ended the campaign in Syria, and Pollard was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for his service; the award was <a href="The%20London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 30 December 1941. Pollard was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in August 1941, and was responsible for establishing the AIF Junior Staff School in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>.

Returning to Australia in August 1942, Pollard was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 1 of the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a>; he served on its headquarters in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> from September until mid-November, when he became Major General <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Vasey</a>'s senior staff officer at the 7th Division. Pollard received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his actions in operations at <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Gona and Sanananda</a>, during which he "displayed unlimited energy and ascertained vital information for use in future operations"; the award was promulgated on 21 December 1943. At the conclusion of the Papuan campaign in January 1943, Pollard was posted to <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> with the 6th Division, which was undergoing training and reinforcement. He was Chief Instructor of the Senior Staff School at Duntroon from December 1943 until February 1945, when he became Deputy Director of Military Operations at General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>'s Allied Land Forces Headquarters in Melbourne.

Pollard held command of the Army's <a href="Greta%20Army%20Camp">Recruit Training Centre</a> at <a href="Greta%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Greta</a>, New South Wales, from February to May 1946. He spent the next two months attached to the headquarters staff of <a href="1st%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">Northern Command</a>. In August he was posted to England to undertake a course at the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="School%20of%20Land/Air%20Warfare">School of Air Support</a> in <a href="Old%20Sarum">Old Sarum</a>, and following his return in February 1947 was allotted to instruct at the soon-to-be-opened RAAF School of Air Support at <a href="Laverton%2C%20Victoria">Laverton</a>, Victoria. It was redesignated the School of Land/Air Warfare in March 1948 and relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a>, New South Wales. Pollard was appointed Director of Personnel Administration at Army Headquarters in January 1949. One of his tasks was to prepare the ground for the reintroduction of compulsory national service; the <a href="National%20Service%20Act%201951">new scheme</a> was enacted in 1951 and remained in force until 1959. Pollard's lieutenant-colonelcy had been made <a href="Substantive%20rank">substantive</a> in September 1946 and his colonelcy in July 1949. He attended the <a href="Imperial%20Defence%20College">Imperial Defence College</a>, London, throughout 1951; he served as <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> from April that year until August 1952, and in the same capacity for <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> until April 1954.

In January 1952, Pollard succeeded Colonel <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">John Wilton</a> as Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters, and became Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee. That August he was one of the Australian delegates joining the <a href="Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for External Affairs</a>, <a href="Richard%20Casey%2C%20Baron%20Casey">Richard Casey</a>, for the inaugural meeting of the <a href="ANZUS">ANZUS</a> Council in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>; the US and New Zealand delegations were led, respectively, by Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> and Minister for External Affairs <a href="Clifton%20Webb%20%28politician%29">Clifton Webb</a>. Pollard also took part in planning for the <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">atomic test at Montebello</a>, Western Australia, in October 1952. Promoted to temporary <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a> in March 1953, Pollard acted as Australian military advisor to Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> at the <a href="Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference</a> in London that June. From July to November he served as commander of the Australian Army Component of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Forces%20Korea">British Commonwealth Forces Korea</a>; the role was responsible for managing the turnover of Australian troops in the theatre and the upkeep of their personal records. Pollard was later appointed Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters, and his rank of brigadier became substantive in December 1953.

In September 1954, Pollard was promoted to temporary <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">major general</a> and appointed Quartermaster General and Third Military Member of the Military Board. At fifty-two, he was the youngest member of the Board. His promotion to major general was made substantive in December 1954. Inspecting conditions for Australian troops deployed to <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a> in December 1955, Pollard was quoted as saying that there were "one or two" serious complaints but that he was "amazed how few there were, considering that the average soldier complains considerably all the time". In August 1957, he was promoted <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> and succeeded <a href="Eric%20Woodward">Eric Woodward</a> as General Officer Commanding <a href="2nd%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">Eastern Command</a>, upon Woodward's appointment as <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>. Headquartered in Sydney, Eastern Command covered the state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and was the superior headquarters for the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a> (CMF). Pollard was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> promulgated on 9 June 1955, and a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the Birthday Honours promulgated on 13 June 1959.

On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General <a href="Ragnar%20Garrett">Sir Ragnar Garrett</a> as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), and was raised to <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2 June 1961. Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's succession had not been a foregone conclusion. The <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="John%20Cramer%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Cramer</a>, attempted to appoint Major General <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a>, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> on the advice of the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, <a href="Athol%20Townley">Athol Townley</a>, who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.

As CGS, Pollard oversaw a major restructure of the Army. Following the lead of the US military, in 1960 the Australian Army replaced its "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under brigade headquarters, with a "<a href="Pentropic%20organisation">pentropic</a>" organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. The reorganisation had been sponsored by Garrett and agreed to by Townley in December 1959. According to historian Chris Clark, Pollard was "personally ambivalent" about the change, which was intended to rationalise resources and strengthen the battalions for overseas deployments but also resulted in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many other militia units. The US in any case abandoned the pentropic system in June 1961, and the Australian Army ultimately returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Wilton, in October 1964. Another of Pollard's focus areas as CGS was the academic qualifications of Army officers. Concerned that Duntroon graduates would begin to fall behind their tertiary-educated peers in the community, he worked to make the college a degree-granting institution, though this did not come to fruition until 1968.

In December 1961, Pollard told the Secretary of the Defence Committee that he considered the Army's strength inadequate to support the government's policy of "forward defence", which involved meeting Communist aggression in South East Asia, well away from the Australian mainland. The CMF, he contended, was not properly equipped to provide relief for regular forces deployed overseas, and conscription "would appear to be politically and economically out of the question". Nevertheless, the government <a href="National%20Service%20Act%201964">reintroduced conscription in 1964</a>. As the threat of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> falling to a Communist takeover became more apparent, the Army began in 1962 to exercise specifically to combat <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> operations, a type of warfare Pollard characterised as "frustrating groping at an elusive enemy"; he added that "no purely military solution to a Communist insurgency situation is possible". In May that year, the Federal government agreed to South Vietnam's request for military instructors; Pollard was responsible for laying down guidelines for the thirty advisors deployed in August as part of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Training%20Team%20Vietnam">Australian Army Training Team Vietnam</a>, led by his friend Colonel <a href="Ted%20Serong">Ted Serong</a>.

Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of sixty, Pollard left the military on 20 January 1963, having recommended Wilton as his successor. He became a <a href="Pastoral%20farming">grazier</a> on a farm at <a href="Wesburn%2C%20Victoria">Wesburn</a>, Victoria. In July 1965, he was made <a href="Honorary%20Colonel">Honorary Colonel</a> (later <a href="Colonel%20Commandant">Colonel Commandant</a>) of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">Royal Australian Regiment</a>, in which capacity he visited Australian troops in South Vietnam. He served as Australian Secretary to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Queen Elizabeth II</a> for the Royal Visit in 1970, and was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> in recognition of his services; the honour was promulgated on 29 May 1970, backdated to 3 May. In 1974, he moved to a new property, which he christened "Duntroon", at <a href="Wyrallah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wyrallah</a>, New South Wales. Pollard died suddenly at his Wyrallah home on 9 March 1978. He was survived by his wife and two sons, and cremated.

Robert Peake the Elder

Robert Peake the Elder (c. 1551–1619) was an English painter active in the later part of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I's</a> reign and for most of the reign of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a>. In 1604, he was appointed picture maker to the heir to the throne, <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Henry</a>; and in 1607, <a href="Serjeant%20Painter">serjeant-painter</a> to King James I – a post he shared with <a href="John%20de%20Critz">John De Critz</a>. Peake is often called "the elder", to distinguish him from his son, the painter and <a href="Popular%20print">print seller</a> <a href="William%20Peake">William Peake</a> (c. 1580–1639) and from his grandson, <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Peake">Sir Robert Peake</a> (c. 1605–67), who followed his father into the family print-selling business.

Peake was the only English-born painter of a group of four artists whose workshops were closely connected. The others were De Critz, <a href="Marcus%20Gheeraerts%20the%20Younger">Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger</a>, and the <a href="portrait%20miniature">miniature painter</a> <a href="Isaac%20Oliver">Isaac Oliver</a>. Between 1590 and about 1625, they specialised in brilliantly coloured, full-length "costume pieces" that are unique to England at this time. It is not always possible to attribute authorship between Peake, De Critz, Gheeraerts and their assistants with certainty.

Peake was born to a <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> family in about 1551. He began his training on 30 April 1565 under Laurence Woodham, who lived at the sign of "The Key" in <a href="Goldsmith">Goldsmith's</a> Row, <a href="Cheapside">Westcheap</a>. He was apprenticed, three years after the miniaturist <a href="Nicholas%20Hilliard">Nicholas Hilliard</a>, to the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Goldsmiths">Goldsmiths’ Company</a> in London. He became a <a href="Livery%20Company">freeman</a> of the company on 20 May 1576. His son William later followed in his father's footsteps as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company and a portrait painter. Peake's training would have been similar to that of <a href="John%20de%20Critz">John de Critz</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Gheeraerts%20the%20Younger">Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger</a>, who may have been pupils of the <a href="Flemish%20painting">Flemish</a> artist <a href="Lucas%20de%20Heere">Lucas de Heere</a>.

Peake is first heard of professionally in 1576 in the pay of the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Revels">Office of the Revels</a>, the department that oversaw court festivities for Elizabeth I. When Peake began practising as a portrait painter is uncertain. According to art historian <a href="Roy%20Strong">Roy Strong</a>, he was "well established" in London by the late 1580s, with a "fashionable clientele". Payments made to him for portraits are recorded in the <a href="Duke%20of%20Rutland">Rutland</a> accounts at <a href="Belvoir%20Castle">Belvoir</a> in the 1590s. A signed portrait from 1593, known as the "Military Commander", shows Peake's early style. Other portraits have been grouped with it on the basis of similar lettering. Its three-quarter-length portrait format is typical of the time.

In 1607, after the death of Leonard Fryer, Peake was appointed <a href="Serjeant%20Painter">serjeant-painter</a> to King James I, sharing the office with John De Critz, who had held the post since 1603. The role entailed the painting of original portraits and their reproduction as new versions, to be given as gifts or sent to foreign courts, as well as the copying and restoring of portraits by other painters in the <a href="Royal%20Collection">royal collection</a>.

In addition to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, such as the painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake's work is not recorded there, it seems as if De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the "<a href="HMS%20Prince%20Royal%20%281610%29">Prince Royal</a>" in 1611.

In 1610, Peake was described as "painter to Prince Henry", the sixteen-year-old prince who was gathering around him a significant cultural <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>. Peake commissioned a translation of Books I-V of <a href="Sebastiano%20Serlio">Sebastiano Serlio's</a> "Architettura", which he dedicated to the prince in 1611. Scholars have deduced from payments made to Peake that his position as painter to <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Henry</a> led to his appointment as serjeant-painter to the king. The payments were listed by the Prince's household officer <a href="David%20Murray%20%28poet%29">Sir David Murray</a> as disbursements from the <a href="Privy%20Purse">Privy Purse</a> to "Mr Peck". On 14 October 1608, Peake was paid £7 for "pictures made by His Highness’ command"; and on 14 July 1609, he was paid £3 "for a picture of His Highness which was given in exchange for the King’s picture". At about the same time, <a href="Isaac%20Oliver">Isaac Oliver</a> was paid £5.10s.0d. for each of three miniatures of the prince. Murray's accounts reveal, however, that the prince was paying more for tennis balls than for any picture.

Peake is also listed in Sir David Murray's accounts for the period between 1 October 1610 and 6 November 1612, drawn up to the day on which Henry, Prince of Wales, died, possibly of typhoid fever, at the age of eighteen: "To Mr Peake for pictures and frames £12; two great pictures of the Prince in arms at length sent beyond the seas £50; and to him for washing, scouring and dressing of pictures and making of frames £20.4s.0d". Peake is listed in the accounts for Henry's funeral under "Artificers and officers of the Works" as "Mr Peake the elder painter". For the occasion, he was allotted seven yards of mourning cloth, plus four for a servant. Also listed is "Mr Peake the younger painter", meaning Robert's son William, who was allotted four yards of mourning cloth.

After the prince's death, Peake moved on to the household of Henry's brother, Charles, Duke of York, the future <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a>. The accounts for 1616, which call Peake the prince's painter, record that he was paid £35 for "three several pictures of his Highness". On 10 July 1613, he was paid £13.6s.8d. by the vice-chancellor of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, "in full satisfaction for Prince Charles his picture", for a full-length portrait which is still in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Library">Cambridge University Library</a>.

Peake died in 1619, probably in mid-October. Until relatively recently, it was believed that Peake died later. <a href="Erna%20Auerbach">Erna Auerbach</a>, "Tudor Artists", London, 1954, p. 148, put his death at around 1625, for example. The catalogue for "The Age of Charles I" exhibition at the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> in 1972, p. 89, suggested Peake was active as late as 1635. His will was made on 10 October 1619 and <a href="Probate">proved</a> on the 16th. The date of his burial is unknown because the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a> later destroyed the registers of his parish church, <a href="St%20Sepulchre-without-Newgate">St Sepulchre-without-Newgate</a>. This was a time of several deaths in the artistic community. <a href="Nicholas%20Hilliard">Nicholas Hilliard</a> had died in January; <a href="Anne%20of%20Denmark">Queen Anne</a>, who had done so much to patronise the arts, in March; and the painter <a href="William%20Larkin%20%28painter%29">William Larkin</a>, Peake's neighbour, in April or May. Though James I reigned until 1625, art historian <a href="Roy%20Strong">Roy Strong</a> considers that the year 1619 "can satisfactorily be accepted as the terminal date of Jacobean painting".

It is difficult to attribute and date portraits of this period because painters rarely signed their work, and their workshops produced portraits "en masse", often sharing standard portrait patterns. Some paintings, however, have been attributed to Peake on the basis of the method of inscribing the year and the sitter's age on his documented portrait of a "military commander" (1592), which reads: "M.BY.RO.| PEAKE" ("made by Robert Peake"). Art historian <a href="Ellis%20Waterhouse">Ellis Waterhouse</a>, however, suspected that the letterer may have worked for more than one studio.

The painting known as "Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601", or simply "The Procession Picture" is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it "one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age". It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an <a href="icon">icon</a>, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, "[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects". <a href="George%20Vertue">George Vertue</a>, the eighteenth-century <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>, called the painting "not well nor ill done".

Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Worcester">Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert</a>, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a <a href="litter%20%28vehicle%29">litter</a>, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of <a href="Edward%20Somerset%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester</a>, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.

Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the "types" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the <a href="Privy%20council">Privy council</a> ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth "great offence". The famous <a href="Ditchley%20portrait">Ditchley portrait</a> (c. 1592), by <a href="Marcus%20Gheeraerts%20the%20Younger">Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger</a>, was used as a type, sometimes called the "Mask of Youth" face-pattern, for the remainder of the reign. It is clear that Gheeraerts' portrait provided the pattern for the queen's image in the procession picture. Other figures also show signs of being traced from patterns, leading to infelicities of perspective and proportion.

At the beginning of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake was one of those who met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.

In 1603, he painted a double portrait, now in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%2C%20New%20York">Metropolitan Museum, New York</a>, of the prince and his boyhood friend <a href="John%20Harington%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Harington%20of%20Exton">John Harington</a>, son of <a href="John%20Harington%2C%201st%20Baron%20Harington%20of%20Exton">Lord Harington of Exton</a> . The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the "<a href="coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">coup de grâce</a>". The prince wears at his belt a jewel of <a href="Saint%20George">St George</a> slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service. The stag is a <a href="fallow%20deer">fallow deer</a>, a non-native species kept at that time in royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a>, painted c. 1605, features <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex</a>, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.

In the same year, Peake also painted his first portrait of James I's only surviving daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth</a>. This work, like the double portrait, for which it might be a companion piece, appears to have been painted for the Harington family, who acted as Elizabeth's guardians from 1603 to 1608. In the background of Elizabeth's portrait is a hunting scene echoing that of the double portrait, and two ladies sit on an artificial mound of a type fashionable in garden design at the time.

Peake again painted Henry outdoors in about 1610. In this portrait, now at the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Turin">Royal Palace of Turin</a>, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed as a young man of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Savoy</a> in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of <a href="Charles%20Emmanuel%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Savoy">Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy</a>.

James I's daughter Elizabeth was also a valuable marriage pawn. She too was offered to Savoy, as a bride for the <a href="Victor%20Amadeus%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Savoy">Prince of Piedmont</a>, the heir of Charles Emanuel. The exchange of portraits as part of royal marriage proposals was the practice of the day and provided regular work for the royal painters and their workshops. Prince Henry commissioned portraits from Peake to send them to the various foreign courts with which marriage negotiations were underway. The prince's accounts show, for example, that the two portraits Peake painted of him in arms in 1611–12 were "sent beyond the seas".

A surviving portrait from this time shows the prince in armour, mounted on a white horse and pulling the winged figure of <a href="Father%20Time">Father Time</a> by the forelock. Art historian John Sheeran suggests this is a classical allusion that signifies opportunity. The old man carries Henry's lance and plumed helmet; and scholar <a href="Chris%20Caple">Chris Caple</a> points out that his pose is similar to that of <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>'s figure of death in "<a href="Knight%2C%20Death%20and%20the%20Devil">Knight, Death and the Devil</a>" (1513). He also observes that the old man was painted later than other components of the painting, since the bricks of the wall show through his wings. When the painting was restored in 1985, the wall and the figure of time were revealed to modern eyes for the first time, having been painted over at some point in the seventeenth century by other hands than Peake's. The painting has also been cut down, the only original canvas edge being that on the left.

Peake's portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope may have been commissioned by her husband, <a href="Earl%20of%20Downe">Sir William Pope</a>, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity. She wears a draped mantle—embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes—and a matching <a href="turban">turban</a>. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court <a href="masque">masque</a>s, as the costume designs of <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> indicate. The painting's near-nudity, however, makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely. Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary <a href="personification">personification</a>s of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a major shareholder in the <a href="Virginia%20Company">Virginia Company</a>.

In 1598, <a href="Francis%20Meres">Francis Meres</a>, in his "Palladis Tamia", included Peake on a list of the best English artists. In 1612, <a href="Henry%20Peacham%20%28born%201578%29">Henry Peacham</a> wrote in "The Gentleman's Exercise" that his "good friend Mr Peake", along with Marcus Gheeraerts, was outstanding "for oil colours". Ellis Waterhouse suggested that the genre of elaborate costume pieces was as much a decorative as a plastic art. He notes that these works, the "enamelled brilliance" of which has become apparent through cleaning, are unique in European art and deserve respect. They were produced chiefly by the workshops of Peake, Gheeraerts the Younger, and De Critz. Sheeran detects the influence of Hilliard's brightly patterned and coloured miniatures in Peake's work and places Peake firmly in the "iconic tradition of late Elizabethan painting". He employed techniques from European Mannerism and followed the artificial and decorative style characteristic of Elizabethan painting. By the time he was appointed serjeant-painter in 1607, his compelling and semi-naive style was somewhat old fashioned compared with De Critz and other contemporaries. However, Peake's portraits of Prince Henry are the first to show his subject in ‘action’ poses.

Sheeran believes that Peake's creativity waned into conservatism, his talent "dampened by mass production". He describes Peake's Cambridge portrait, "Prince Charles, as Duke of York" as poorly drawn, with a lifeless pose, in a stereotyped composition that "confirms the artist's reliance on a much repeated formula in his later years". Art historian and curator Karen Hearn, on the other hand, praises the work as "magnificent" and draws attention to the naturalistically rendered note pinned to the curtain. Peake painted the portrait to mark Charles's visit to Cambridge on 3 and 4 March 1613, during which he was awarded an M.A.—four months after the death of his brother. Depicting Prince Charles wearing the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Garter</a> and Lesser George, Peake here reverts to a more formal, traditional style of portraiture. The note pinned to a curtain of <a href="cloth%20of%20gold">cloth of gold</a>, painted in <a href="trompe-l%27%C5%93il">trompe-l'œil</a> fashion, commemorates Charles's visit in Latin. <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s of the portrait reveal that Peake painted it over another portrait. <a href="Pentimento">Pentimenti</a>, or signs of alteration, can be detected: for example, Charles's right hand originally rested on his waist.

Quietly Confident Quartet

The Quietly Confident Quartet was the self-given name of the Australian men's 4 × 100 metres <a href="Medley%20swimming">medley relay swimming</a> team that won the gold medal at the <a href="1980%20Summer%20Olympics">1980 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>. The United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest against the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a> and, through the 2016 Olympics, the Australian victory remains the only occasion the United States has not won <a href="List%20of%20Olympic%20medalists%20in%20swimming%20%28men%29%234%20%C3%97%20100%20metres%20medley%20relay">the event at Olympic level</a> since its inception in 1960. The quartet consisted of <a href="backstroke%20swimming">backstroker</a> <a href="Mark%20Kerry">Mark Kerry</a>, <a href="breaststroke">breaststroke</a>r <a href="Peter%20Evans%20%28swimmer%29">Peter Evans</a>, <a href="butterfly%20swimming">butterflyer</a> <a href="Mark%20Tonelli">Mark Tonelli</a> and <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyler</a> <a href="Neil%20Brooks">Neil Brooks</a>. The team was nominally led by its oldest member Tonelli, who was 23 and was also a spokesperson for the Australian athletes' campaign for their right to compete at the Olympics against the wishes of the <a href="Fraser%20Government">Fraser Government</a>. The team was seen as an unlikely prospect to win; all four of the swimmers had clashed with swimming authorities over disciplinary issues and three experienced suspension or expulsion from the Australian team during their careers.

Australia had previously won medals in the event, but was not regarded as one of the favourites for the gold, as the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart <a href="Sergey%20Koplyakov">Sergey Koplyakov</a> in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.

The Australian team for the event was a young and inexperienced foursome. <a href="Mark%20Tonelli">Mark Tonelli</a> was the oldest at the age of 23, followed by <a href="Mark%20Kerry">Mark Kerry</a>, who turned 21 a month after the Olympics. Both were attending their second Olympics, while <a href="Peter%20Evans%20%28swimmer%29">Peter Evans</a> and <a href="Neil%20Brooks">Neil Brooks</a> were 18 and 17 respectively and had never represented Australia at the <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth</a>, World Championship or Olympic level. Evans and Brooks were from <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, a state that had never been prominent in Australian swimming. The team members had some contact prior to their Olympic selection; Brooks' family had billeted Tonelli in 1976 when the Australian Olympic team held a training camp in <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>. Brooks cited his experience with Tonelli as a motivating factor in his career.

The quartet was also marked by rebellious and anti-establishment tendencies. Tonelli and Kerry were expelled from the <a href="1978%20Commonwealth%20Games">1978 Commonwealth Games</a> team by the <a href="Swimming%20Australia">Australian Swimming Union</a> for violating a curfew during a training camp in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> before the team's trip to <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, Canada for the competition; Tonelli had been out drinking and admitted to smoking <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>, which was not illegal in Hawaii, while Kerry had been courting a female. In 1980, during the lead-up to the selection of the Olympic team, Brooks walked out of a training camp, alleging that the coaches were neglecting him, while Evans once stopped during a training session and refused to do extra mileage, emphatically proclaiming that "work is a poor substitute for talent". Later in their careers, Evans and Brooks continued to have their clashes with swimming officialdom; Evans over his coaches' demands for more training mileage and Brooks over swimmers' human rights. Brooks was later suspended twice in his career for his clashes with swimming authorities, and expelled from the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">Australian Institute of Sport</a> for indiscipline.

The rebel qualities of the group were on show in the lead-up to the Olympics. An obstacle arose with the 1979 <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the United States. The Australian <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> was also the patron of the <a href="Australian%20Olympic%20Committee">Australian Olympic Committee</a>, and he and sections of the public put significant political pressure on the athletes to join the boycott. Tonelli realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes, fighting for their right to compete and publicising their cause to the Australian community. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." He rhetorically asked: "Do you really think that if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?"

Kerry was equally adamant that he was going to compete, unlike some swimmers who decided to make personal boycotts. He received offers from Australian officials to not compete in return for financial payments. He said

According to women's swimming captain <a href="Lisa%20Forrest">Lisa Forrest</a>, Tonelli adopted populist tactics in championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending "wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns", claiming that this contradicted the proposed protest against the invasion and Russian military aggression. Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend <a href="Lance%20Shilton">Lance Shilton</a>, who had called the athletes traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy for the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. He responded by rolling his eyes and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television; Tonelli mistakenly thought that only his voice was being broadcast at the time and that the images were showing something else. Forrest said that "the damage was done—one of our most prominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec".

The United States had always won the 4 × 100 m medley relay since the event's inception at the Olympics in <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201960%20Summer%20Olympics">1960</a> with comfortable margins. The closest winning buffer was 2.6 seconds and in <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972</a> and <a href="Swimming%20at%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics">1976</a> they had won by 4.10 and 3.72 s respectively; their boycott opened up the field in the event. In the five previous times the event had been contested, Australia's best result had come in the inaugural race in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, where the team of <a href="David%20Theile">David Theile</a>, <a href="Terry%20Gathercole">Terry Gathercole</a>, <a href="Neville%20Hayes">Neville Hayes</a> and <a href="Geoff%20Shipton">Geoff Shipton</a> out-touched Japan to claim silver. The only other time that Australia had won a medal was in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964</a>, when <a href="Peter%20Reynolds">Peter Reynolds</a>, <a href="Ian%20O%27Brien">Ian O'Brien</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Berry">Kevin Berry</a> and <a href="David%20Dickson%20%28swimmer%29">David Dickson</a> finished behind the United States and Germany. The following two Games saw a fourth placing and an elimination in the heats. The previous outing in 1976 in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> had seen Australia come sixth. Kerry was the only veteran of the 1976 relay team who returned to the Olympics in Moscow.

Australia was regarded by swimming analysts as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats—<a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts had the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, <a href="Viktor%20Kuznetsov%20%28swimmer%29">Viktor Kuznetsov</a> and <a href="Arsens%20Miskarovs">Arsens Miskarovs</a> respectively, and their butterflyer <a href="Yevgeny%20Seredin">Yevgeny Seredin</a> had come fifth in his 100 m event. Their freestyler <a href="Sergey%20Koplyakov">Sergey Koplyakov</a> later came fourth in the corresponding 100 m event. The British boasted <a href="Duncan%20Goodhew">Duncan Goodhew</a>, the 100 m breaststroke gold medallist, and <a href="Gary%20Abraham">Gary Abraham</a>, who had placed fifth in the 100 m backstroke. Sweden's butterflyer <a href="P%C3%A4r%20Arvidsson">Pär Arvidsson</a> and backstroker <a href="Bengt%20Baron">Bengt Baron</a> had won their respective 100 m events and their freestyle swimmer <a href="Per%20Holmertz">Per Holmertz</a> would win silver in the 100 m a few days later. Their weakest swimmer was the breaststroker <a href="Peter%20Berggren">Peter Berggren</a>, who came ninth in the 100 m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Brooks later came seventh in his 100 m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual event, winning bronze in the breaststroke. Kerry had been eliminated in the 100 m backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in the 100 m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer; the nation did not have an entrant in the 100 m butterfly. Adding to the pressure was Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any sport at the 1976 Olympics. This meant that the public were still awaiting their first gold since the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. Coming into the Olympics, Australia was ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.

The medley relay was scheduled for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of swimming competition, with heats in the morning and the final in the evening. Australia's prospects improved when Sweden was disqualified in the first heat. Australia and the Soviet Union swam in the second heat. With their superior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice quartet in the heats. On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest Kerry—<a href="Glenn%20Patching">Glenn Patching</a> swam the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the first three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34 s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13 s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians still qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets were more than 1.5 s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case, despite resting all of their first-choice quartet, the home team were still faster than the Australians, who had fielded all but one of their full-strength team.

Evans brashly took the opportunity to attempt to regain the psychological ascendancy from Goodhew, confronting him privately and stating that "we will win it", later reporting that the Briton was astounded by his posturing. The eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, Tonelli convened the team as its "de facto" leader. He asked his compatriots to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome the "Quietly Confident Quartet" because they exhibited a reserved self-belief as they lined up for the race. Whereas most of the other teams were "psyching up" in the marshalling area, the Australians were remaining light-hearted and placid, confident that they could perform in the water.

Patching was one of several backstrokers who had slipped on the starting area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87 s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81 s, with <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100 m mark, recording a time of 58.84 s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63 s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45 s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed <a href="East%20Germany">East Germans</a>.

Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best over the distance. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind Seredin until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the time the swimmers touched the wall. If Tonelli had replicated his relay leg in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36 s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81 s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third-placed Great Britain.

Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn to take the lead as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25 m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100 m freestyle gold medallist, <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Woithe">Jörg Woithe</a> of East Germany.

The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. It remains the only time that the United States has not won the men's event. The team made a celebratory dive into the water and did a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it". Forrest hailed the win as "a gold medal that should never have been".

<a href="Sportscaster">Sportscaster</a> <a href="Norman%20May">Norman May</a>'s dramatic call of the race on the <a href="2UE">2UE</a> radio network, ending with "Gold, gold for Australia, gold!", became one of Australia's best-known and most iconic sports commentaries.

Relations between the Olympians and the Australian Government remained tense after months of political struggle regarding the boycott. A prime minister would customarily send a congratulatory message to Olympic medallists. However, the Australian Olympic chef de mission <a href="Phil%20Coles">Phil Coles</a> confirmed at the following day's press conference that the quartet had not received a message from <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>. Australian journalists soon bombarded Fraser's office with phone calls asking why he had not applauded the athletes. Various members of the government recommended that Fraser congratulate the swimmers, but the prime minister baulked. When questioned in a radio interview, he said "I hope that circumstances do not arise over the next few years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram. However, he would not send his message directly to the Olympic village, so the telegram was sent to the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to close its doors to the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the fence to Australian Olympic officials. Fraser's telegram said:

Coles reported that the relay squad tore up the prime minister's message.

The quartet never competed as a unit after the Moscow Olympics. Tonelli retired immediately after the Games, while Kerry took an extended break. The backstroker attempted a comeback in the leadup to the <a href="1982%20Commonwealth%20Games">1982 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, but his abbreviated preparation before the selection trials was not enough and he was defeated by other swimmers. This left Evans and Brooks as the only members of the 1980 team to participate in Australia's medley relay victory at the Commonwealth Games. In 1984, Kerry secured a recall to the team as Australia's preferred backstroker, while Brooks was surpassed by <a href="Mark%20Stockwell">Mark Stockwell</a> as the leading freestyler. Australia came third in the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a> in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold; Evans and Kerry swam in the final, while Brooks did the freestyle leg in the heats. Evans and Kerry retired after the Olympics, and Brooks was not the first-choice swimmer in 1986, meaning that a totally different quartet competed in the medley relay at the <a href="1986%20Commonwealth%20Games">1986 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Brooks was suspended for drunken behaviour on the flight back to Australia, and then retired, and all four members of the Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.

El Señor Presidente

' (Mister President""') is a 1946 novel written in Spanish by <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>-winning Guatemalan writer and diplomat <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Asturias">Miguel Ángel Asturias</a> (1899–1974). A landmark text in <a href="Latin%20American%20literature">Latin American literature</a>, explores the nature of political <a href="dictatorship">dictatorship</a> and its effects on society. Asturias makes early use of a literary technique now known as <a href="magic%20realism">magic realism</a>. One of the most notable works of the <a href="dictator%20novel">dictator novel</a> genre, developed from an earlier Asturias short story, written to protest social injustice in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in the <a href="writer%27s%20home">author's home</a> town.

Although does not explicitly identify its setting as early twentieth-century Guatemala, the novel's title character was inspired by the 1898–1920 presidency of <a href="Manuel%20Estrada%20Cabrera">Manuel Estrada Cabrera</a>. Asturias began writing the novel in the 1920s and finished it in 1933, but the strict censorship policies of Guatemalan dictatorial governments delayed its publication for thirteen years.

The character of the President rarely appears in the story but Asturias creates a number of other characters to show the terrible effects of living under a dictatorship. His use of dream imagery, <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a>, <a href="simile">simile</a>, and repetition of particular phrases, combined with a discontinuous structure, which consists of abrupt changes of style and viewpoint, springs from <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> and <a href="Ultraist%20movement">ultraist</a> influences. The style of influenced a generation of Latin American authors. The themes of Asturias's novel, such as the inability to tell reality apart from dreams, the power of the written word in the hands of authorities, and the alienation produced by tyranny, center around the experience of living under a dictatorship.

On its eventual publication in Mexico in 1946, quickly met with critical acclaim. In 1967, Asturias received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for his entire body of work. This international acknowledgment was celebrated throughout <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, where it was seen as a recognition of the region's literature as a whole. Since then, has been adapted for the screen and theater.

In a 1970 interview, the German critic Gunter W. Lorenz asked Miguel Ángel Asturias why he began to write and the novelist replied: 

This experience, at the age of 18, led Asturias to write "" ("The Political Beggars"), an unpublished short story that would later develop into his first novel, . Asturias began writing in 1922, while he was still a law student in Guatemala. He moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 1923, where he studied <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a> at the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a> under <a href="George%20Raynaud">George Raynaud</a>. While living in <a href="France">France</a>, he continued to work on the book and also associated with members of the <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist movement</a> as well as fellow future Latin American writers such as <a href="Arturo%20Uslar%20Pietri">Arturo Uslar Pietri</a> and the <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n <a href="Alejo%20Carpentier">Alejo Carpentier</a>. The novel was completed in 1933, shortly before Asturias returned to Guatemala.

Even though was written in France and is set in an unnamed Latin American country, governed by an unnamed President in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, there is still plenty of support linking the novel to the <a href="Manuel%20Estrada%20Cabrera">Manuel Estrada Cabrera</a> era in Guatemala. For example, as critic <a href="Jack%20Himelblau">Jack Himelblau</a> explains, "Asturias [...] wrote his novel primarily with his compatriots in mind, who, undoubtedly, had lived through the tyranny of Estrada Cabrera from 1898 to 1920." Estrada Cabrera was notorious for his brutal repression of dissent in Guatemala, and Asturias had been involved in protests against his rule in 1920. Asturias integrated and reworked incidents from Estrada Cabrera's dictatorship into the novel, such as the torture of a political adversary, who had been tricked "into believing that his innocent wife had been unfaithful to him".

Estrada Cabrera was eventually forced out of office as a result of popular disturbances and the intervention of <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> and other foreign diplomats. Rather than go into exile, however, the ex-president opted to defend himself against criminal charges. In the ensuing trial, Asturias served as a legal secretary and so, as <a href="Gregory%20Rabassa">Gregory Rabassa</a>'s biographical sketch points out, he had the opportunity to base his own fictional leader—the President—on his observations of the disgraced Guatemalan dictator. As Asturias himself put it:

Despite the manifest influence of Asturias's experiences in Guatemala under Estrada Cabrera and Ubico, and despite certain historical ties, critic Richard Callan observes that Asturias's "attention is not limited to his times and nation, but ranges across the world and reaches back through the ages. By linking his created world with the dawn of history, and his twentieth-century characters with myths and archetypes, he has anchored them to themes of universal significance." Asturias himself affirms that he "wrote without a social commitment". By this he means that unlike some of his other books, such as ("Legends of Guatemala") or ("Men of Maize"), " had a wider relevance because it did not focus so heavily on Guatemalan myths and traditions." Asturias depicts aspects of life that are common to all dictatorial regimes, and so establishes as one of his most influential works.

The novel begins on the Cathedral Porch, where beggars spend their nights. One beggar, the Zany, is exhausted after being continually harassed about his deceased mother. When one of the President's loyal military men, Colonel Jose Parrales Sonriente, jeers the word "mother" at him, the Zany instinctively retaliates and murders the Colonel. The beggars are interrogated and tortured into agreeing that the retired General Eusebio Canales, once in the President's military, and the independent lawyer Abel Carvajal killed the Colonel because according to the President's men, there is no way "an idiot is responsible". Meanwhile, a delusional Zany flees "away down the shadowy streets in a paroxysm of mad terror".

A rare glimpse of the President shows him ordering Miguel Angel Face, sometimes referred to as the President's "favourite", to help General Canales flee before he is arrested in the morning for the murder of Sonriente. The President, who presumably orchestrated the accusations for his own purposes, wants Canales to flee because "running away would be a confession of guilt".

At the Two Step, a local tavern, Miguel Angel Face meets Lucio Vásquez, a policeman, and is inspired to tell Vásquez that he is kidnapping General Canales's daughter, Camila, as "a ruse to deceive the watchful authorities". He claims to be kidnapping Camila to cover up the truth of Canales's escape. Later, Vásquez meets with his friend Genaro Rodas, and upon leaving a bar they see the Zany. To Genaro Rodas's horror, Vásquez shoots the Zany. The aftermath of this scene is witnessed by Don Benjamin, a puppet-master, whose "puppets took the tragedy as their theme". Genaro Rodas returns home and discusses the murder of the Zany with his wife, Fedina de Rodas, and informs her that the police plan to arrest Canales in the morning. Meanwhile, Canales leaves Miguel Angel Face's home, exhausted and anxious about fleeing the country. Later that evening, Canales escapes safely while the police ransack his home and Miguel Angel Face sneaks in to bring Camila safely to the Two Step.

In the early morning, Fedina de Rodas rushes to Canales's house in an attempt to save him from arrest for the murder of Colonel Sonriente. She arrives too late and is found by the Judge Advocate, an aide to the President. He arrests her as an accomplice in Canales's escape, and tortures her in hopes of learning Canales's location. The soldiers smear lime on her breasts before giving her back her baby, which causes its death as it refuses to feed from "the sharpness of the lime".

Back at the Two Step, Miguel Angel Face visits Camila. He tries to find her a home with her aunts and uncles but they all refuse to take her in for fear of losing their friends and being associated with "the daughter of one of the President's enemies". More is revealed of Miguel Angel Face's complex character and the struggle between his physical desires for Camila and his desire to become a better person in a world ruled by terror.

Camila grows very ill and a boy is sent to inform Miguel Angel Face that her condition has worsened. He dresses quickly and rushes to the Two Step to see her. Eventually relieved of charges by the President, Fedina de Rodas is purchased by a brothel, and when it is discovered that she is holding her dead baby in her arms, she is placed in a hospital. Miguel Angel Face informs Major Farfan, who is in the service of the President, that there is a threat to his life. By this act saving a man in danger, Angel Face hopes "God would grant him Camila's life in exchange". General Canales escapes into a village and, assisted by three sisters and a smuggler, crosses the frontier of the country after saving the sisters by killing a doctor who harassed them with the payment of an absurd debt.

A student, a sacristan and Abel Carvajal, together in a prison cell, talk because they are "terrified of the silence" and "terrified of the darkness". Carvajal's wife runs all over town, visiting the President and influential figures such as the Judge Advocate, begging for her husband's release because she is left in the dark regarding what has happened to him. Carvajal is given a chance to read his indictment but, unable to defend himself against falsified evidence, is sentenced to execution.

Miguel Angel Face is advised that if he really loves her then Camila can be spared "by means of the sacrament of marriage" and the two of them are soon married. Camila is healing and struggling with the complexities of her new marriage. General Canales dies suddenly in the midst of plans to lead a revolution when he is falsely informed that the President has attended his daughter's wedding.

The President runs for re-election, championed in a bar by his fawning supporters, while Angel Face is entrusted with an international diplomatic mission. Camila and Angel Face share an emotional parting. Major Farfan intercepts Angel Face once he reaches the port and arrests him on the President's orders. Angel Face is violently beaten and imprisoned and an impostor takes his place on the departing ship. Camila, now pregnant, waits anxiously for letters from her husband. When she is past hope, Camila moves to the countryside with her young boy, whom she calls Miguel. Angel Face becomes the nameless prisoner in cell 17. He thinks constantly of Camila as the hope of seeing her again is the "last and only thing that remained alive in him" and ultimately dies heartbroken when he is falsely told that she has become the President's mistress.

The Cathedral Porch stands in ruins and prisoners who have been released are quickly replaced by other unfortunate souls. The puppet-master, Don Benjamin, has been reduced to madness because of the environment of terror he has been made to endure. Readers are given one more glimpse of the maddening state of life under a dictatorship. The epilogue concludes with a more hopeful tone, which is seen through a "mother's voice telling her rosary" which concludes with the <a href="Kyrie">Kyrie</a> eleison; the call for the "Lord to have Mercy".

The fact that the novel's title character, the President, is never named gives him a mythological dimension, rather than the personality of a specific Guatemalan dictator. Literary scholar Kevin Bauman notes that readers are not let into the mind of the President; instead his appearance is "continually re-evaluated, re-defined, and, ultimately, re-constructed according to his perception by others, similar to Asturias's own novelistic (re)vision of Estrada Cabrera's regime". According to literary critic Hughes Davies, the President "represents political corruption but his presentation as an evil deity who is worshiped in terms that mockingly echo religious ritual elevates him to a mythical plane" and he is "an inverted image of both the Christian and Mayan deities since he is the source only of death". The dictator also has an element of mystery about him—it seems that no one knows where he is because he occupies several houses on the outskirts of the town. Mystery also surrounds the questions of when and how he sleeps. In the novel, rumors abound that he sleeps beside the telephone with a whip in his hand while others claim that he never sleeps at all. 
Because the appearance of the President is infrequent in the novel, readers' perceptions of him are formed through other, often minor, characters and episodes. As such, literary critic Himelblau states that "the novel does not develop the figure of the President as a fictive personage, does not follow the President through a series of actions or <a href="Diegesis">diegetic</a> complications that lead to psychological-existential changes or transformations of his character".

Miguel Angel Face (orig. Spanish ) is the novel's complex <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>. He is introduced as the President's confidential adviser; there are many references to him as the President's favorite and he is repeatedly described "as beautiful and as wicked as Satan". As the plot proceeds readers see his struggle to remain loyal to the dictator in the face of the regime's increasingly horrific acts. Angel Face is faced with the challenge of reconciling his position of power among a terrorized people with his desire to fulfill a higher moral purpose. In the words of literary critic Richard Franklin, he "struggles to affirm his absolute existence and to relate this to an authentic self". Angel Face's linguistic intensity often reflects his inner moral struggle: 'An animal makes no mistake in its sexual reckonings,' he thought. 'We piss children into the graveyard. The trumpets of Judgement Day—very well, it won't be a trumpet. Golden scissors will cut through the continuous stream of children. We men are like pigs' tripes stuffed with mincemeat by a demon butcher to make sausages. And when I mastered my own nature so as to save Camila from my desire, I left a part of myself unstuffed; that's why I feel empty, uneasy, angry, ill caught in a trap. Woman is the mincemeat into which man stuffs himself like a pig's tripes for his own gratification. What vulgarity'

General Eusebio Canales (alias "Chamarrita" or Prince of Arms) is forced into exile after being accused of the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. He appears to be organizing a <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.

Camila, General Canales's daughter, is (somewhat reluctantly) rescued by Miguel Angel Face, when none of her relatives will take her in upon the flight of her father. Eventually Angel Face chooses Camila over his former master, the President. The two marry and she gives birth to his son, but only once Angel Face has disappeared. She and her son, whom she names Miguel, are last seen having moved to the countryside to escape the President's influence. She is the very picture of the adolescent who has been denied even the smallest margin of liberty, as critic Callan observes: "when Camila was thought to be dying a priest came to administer the sacrament of Penance. Her girlish faults stand out in the contrast with the evil that weighs upon the city. Indeed, one of the things she mentions in her confession is no fault at all: she went horseback riding astride, in the presence of somegbujyvj Indians."

The Zany (orig. Spanish "el Pelele"), also translated as the Idiot by some critics, appears only in the first four chapters and again at the end of chapter seven but serves a critical function in the novel. The Zany, who "looked like a corpse when he was asleep" and had eyes that "saw nothing, felt nothing" is critical to establishing the tone of the novel and triggering the novel's action. Critic John Walker argues that, by "choosing the Idiot as a representative of the innocent, the a-political, who suffer the abuses of a totalitarian regime [...] Asturias shows how dictatorship corrupts people and destroys their values to the extent that compassion for one's companion in distress ceases to exist." In fact, it becomes clear that the only happiness that the Zany experiences is through the memory of his dead mother. Asturias then shows how "el Pelele", a mother-loving figure, "suffers at the hands of those who, long under the domination of the over-aggressive father figure, lack love and pity". Furthermore, "el Pelele" is a tool that allows readers to see the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship ruled by terror. His murderous act seems to trigger the subsequent events of the novel and to impact on all the characters. Also important is the fact that the one moment of complete happiness experienced by the Zany in the novel takes place while he is in a dream-like state. Walker argues that this serves to highlight the harsh, nightmarish world of reality in which he has been forced to live.

The novel includes a host of minor characters who, in Richard Franklin's words, "grope for the means to assert the validity of self and to anchor this individuality in a nightmare which constantly faces it with black nothingness". These characters range from Colonel José Parrales Sonriente, otherwise known as the "man with the little mule", whose murder at the Cathedral Porch opens the novel, to a series of beggars, prisoners, minor officials, relatives, flatterers, barkeepers and prostitutes. Some of these are tragic figures, such as Fedina de Rodas, who readers see tortured and then sold to a brothel while she still clutches her dead baby in her arms. Others, however, provide <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a>. Sometimes they have colorful or playful names or nicknames, such as "Flatfoot" (a beggar), the "Talking Cow" (a woman who delivers a speech of praise to the President), or Doña Benjamin VenJamón, who, with her husband the puppet-master Don Benjamin, closes the novel with a lament for the demise of the Cathedral Porch.

According to scholar Luis Leal, in the genre of magic realism, "the writer confronts reality and tries to untangle it, to discover what is mysterious in things, in life, in human acts." Magic realist writing does not create imaginary creatures or places; instead, the writer tries to display "the mysterious relationship between man and his circumstances". Leal further points out that in magic realism, "key events have no logical or psychological explanation. The magical realist does not try to copy the surrounding reality or to wound it but to seize the mystery that breathes behind things." He also clarifies that "magical realism is not magic literature either. Its aim, unlike that of magic, is to express emotions, not to evoke them".

To many scholars, is a landmark Latin American novel because of Asturias's early use of magic realism, a literary technique often employed by acclaimed Latin American writers such as <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>. In an interview with Asturias, Gunter Lorenz heralded Asturias as the inventor of magic realism, and even as its most successful practitioner. Asturias himself defines this style not as "a concrete reality but a reality that arises from a definitely magical imagination ... in which we see the real disappear and the dream emerge, in which dreams are transformed into a tangible reality". Richard Franklin argues that magic realism is most evident in Asturias's exploration and depiction of the innermost reality of the human mind. This exploration is combined with "the material content of an urban mass caught in the grip of an iron regime" throughout the novel. Franklin goes on to herald the synthesis of these two elements as "a real contribution to the novelistic genre of America".

Asturias first wrote in response to the dictatorial rule of <a href="Manuel%20Estrada%20Cabrera">Manuel Estrada Cabrera</a>. Because Asturias spent a decade writing the novel, the delay in its publication, and the fact that it never names its eponymous President, many scholars have noted that it could equally be taken to apply to the subsequent regime of Jorge Ubico. Moreover, since the novel's publication, it has been used to critique dictatorial rule throughout Latin America. In its examination of the nature of dictatorial power in general, it helped initiate the new genre of the dictator novel. As literary critic <a href="Gerald%20Martin">Gerald Martin</a> argues, is "the first real dictator novel".

The dictator novel is a genre that has developed as a vehicle for Latin American writers to critique concentrated authority. Assistant Professor of Spanish at Walsh University, Jorge J Barrueto, argues that has been heralded as epitomizing dictatorship, "a phenomenon perceived to be a natural and inherent trait in the region". According to Garcia Calderon, the legacy of <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> in Latin America has often led to the rise of an absolute authority, which seeks to contain a nation's inner conflict. Once in power, the man in charge often seeks complete control; he often amends constitutions, dismantling laws which previously prevented his re-election. For example, in 1899 General Manuel Estrada Cabrera altered the Guatemalan Constitution which had previously prohibited his re-election. Typically, however, dictator novels attempt to examine the abstract nature of authority figures and to question the idea of authority in general instead of focusing on the rule of a particular dictator.

Asturias's text marks a dramatic shift in narrative writing. Precursors such as <a href="Domingo%20Faustino%20Sarmiento">Domingo Sarmiento</a>'s "<a href="Facundo">Facundo</a>" (1845) were judged on how adequately they reflected reality. With its stylized magic realism, Asturias's broke from this realist paradigm—it is an <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> novel that laid the foundation for many other authors to develop what is now a broad and extensive genre.

According to Latin American literary scholar Gerald Martin, Asturias's , which was written and published before the <a href="Latin%20American%20Boom">Latin American Boom</a> of the 1960s, uses a style now classified as the "new novel" or "new narrative". In this novel, Asturias breaks from the <a href="Historical%20novel">historic</a> and <a href="Literary%20realism">realist</a> style that dominated novels at the time. Martin argues that the novel "exemplifies more clearly than any other novel the crucial link between European Surrealism and Latin American Magical Realism. It is, indeed, the first fully-fledged Surrealist novel in Latin America."

Richard Franklin contends that on occasion <a href="surrealist">surrealist</a> writing obscures meaning, but in Asturias avoids this flaw. His combination of rationalism with "a world of forms" creates "an imagery which reveals a deeper reality, one which is more deeply rooted in the human psyche". As such, Asturias's surrealist style highlights the modern disintegration of long-standing belief systems. Literary scholar Gabriele Eckart gives as an excellent example of Asturias's surrealist style his portrayal of The Zany's psychic processes in which "language sometimes breaks apart into incomprehensible sounds". This allows Asturias to present the real and imaginary, as well as the communicable and incommunicable, as non-contradictory. Himelblau also highlights how projects "reality in relative, fluid terms—that is it allows its characters to disclose the temporal setting of the novel's fictional events". In this regard, then, Himelblau notes that "is also, as far as we are aware, the first novel in Spanish America that seeks to render fictional reality of time as a function of point of view". The novel defies traditional narrative style by inserting numerous episodes that contribute little or nothing to the plot as the characters in these episodes often appear inconsistently. Instead of relaying the book's themes through characters, Asturias uses repetition of motifs and a mythical substructure to solidify the book's message.

Asturias employs <a href="figurative%20language">figurative language</a> to describe dream imagery and the irrational. Literary critic Hughes Davies points out that Asturias frequently appeals to the reader's auditory senses. Asturias's often <a href="Incantation">incantatory</a> style employs "unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound". This helps readers to understand the physical as well as the psychological aspects of the novel. According to Knightly, "few of Asturias's characters have much psychological depth; their inner conflicts tend to be externalized and played out at the archetypal level". More significantly, Asturias was the first Latin American novelist to combine <a href="stream%20of%20consciousness%20writing">stream of consciousness writing</a> and figurative language. Hughes Davies argues that from the outset of , the gap between words and reality is exemplified through <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a>, <a href="simile">simile</a> and repetition of phrases. Knightly notes that "animistic elements surface occasionally in the characters' stream of consciousness". For example, in the chapter "Tohil's Dance", <a href="Tohil">Tohil</a>, the God of Rain in <a href="Maya%20mythology">Maya mythology</a>, is imagined by Angel Face as arriving "riding on a river of pigeons' breasts which flowed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil demands a human sacrifice and is content only so long as he "can prevail over men who are hunters of men". Tohil pronounces: "Henceforth there will be neither true death nor true life. Now dance." As Knightly explains, this scene follows the President's orders for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that ends in his death, and is "a sign of the President's evil nature and purposes". Davies contends that these literary techniques, when "combined together with a discontinuous structure, give the text its surrealistic and nightmarish atmosphere".

Asturias blurs the separation between dream and reality throughout , making it one of the novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic <a href="Ariel%20Dorfman">Ariel Dorfman</a> notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of <a href="figurative%20language">figurative language</a>. This stylistic choice is reflected in the content of the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes that the President is sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction between reality and dream. This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the line between reality and dream for the people being ruled.

Asturias's ambiguous use of detail adds to the confusion between reality and dream. For example, the title pages of parts one and two state that they take place between April 21 and 27. Part three, on the other hand, occurs over "Weeks, Months, Years". While this time-scale initially appears very specific, no year is indicated. Furthermore, the novel is set in a country similar to Guatemala and includes references to <a href="Maya%20mythology">Maya gods</a> (such as in the chapter "Tohil's Dance") but no direct statement by any character confirms this. Bauman argues that Asturias, by "preferring instead to distance himself from the immediate historical reality and focus critical light on the internal problems", attends to what "he sees there". This enables Asturias to address a wider audience, not restricted to Guatemalans, that can relate individually to the experience of living under dictatorial rule.

In obscuring reality, truth becomes unclear. As literary critic Mireille Rosello notes, it is the President who decides what is true, denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike the characters in the novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality that no longer exists under the dictatorship of the President. "Truth" does not exist before the President puts it into words, and even at that, the only "truth" under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given moment—one cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events. The characters are thus left unaware of what constitutes the "truth".

A major theme of the <a href="dictator%20novel">dictator novel</a> concerns the use of writing as a medium of power. In , Asturias uses language to challenge <a href="dictator">dictator</a>ial power. Throughout the novel the reader observes the authority of the President over the people through his control of what they write. In the chapter "The President's Mail-Bag", a stream of letters informs the President of peoples' actions. While many are "writing the truth" and turning in their fellow citizens, many others feel that "it is not safe to trust to paper". Writing is closely linked to authority and is a means to solidify power, because language can be manipulated into lies that eventually kill. For example, the President orders a newspaper to include the false statement that he attended the wedding of Camila, the daughter of General Canales. When the General reads these words and perceives them as truth, his heart is broken and he subsequently dies. Miguel Angel Face is also killed by the manipulation of words: he is told that Camila has become the President's mistress, and upon hearing this falsified news, he loses the will to live. These episodes in the novel demonstrate how closely language, the written word, and power are linked. The characters in lose their sense of reality, making it difficult for them to know who to trust. As Rosello argues, "in this state of terror, language is deliberately used as a means of seducing the addressee into harmlessness, and has lost its function of conveying information".

In , hope is suppressed by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate states in the novel, "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It can be argued that Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside can be seen as the one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic <a href="Jean%20Franco">Jean Franco</a>, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: "The system is undermined only by love—the love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death."

The theme of tyranny and alienation shows how a dictatorship not only alienates and "<a href="Other%20%28philosophy%29">other</a>s" the people in the country, but also prevents the country itself from achieving European modernization. In a 1967 essay, literary critic <a href="Ariel%20Dorfman">Ariel Dorfman</a> argues that "dictatorship, which in manifested itself in the political realm, is now a dictatorship of fire of the word, but always a tyranny that men themselves ask for, adore, and help to build". Dorfman also notes that "The 'little human bundles' of Asturias's world end up destroying themselves, being disintegrated by the very forces that they themselves spoke." By this he means that the characters are undone by their own actions and words as the President uses and twists them. The tyranny of language perversely parallels the political oppression which is omnipresent in Asturias's world. Richard Franklin argues that "in a philosophical sense, Asturias has eloquently affirmed the validity of individual experience".

Asturias shows how, under the conditions of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running "aimlessly, with his mouth opened and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting". Just a few lines later, the Zany is "whin[ing] like an injured dog". In what is in part a critique of the book, Jorge Barrueto argues that depicts Latin America as a whole as "Other". Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this "otherness" as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and no more than an "imitation of the European ways". Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be a land where "Otherness" prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot "evolve" or reach truly European levels of modernity. For Barrueto, "this narrative's goal is to prove that Latin American societies, though they are aware of the blueprint of Modernity, are unable to act accordingly."

According to Latin American literature scholar Richard Callan, the dichotomy between destruction and fertility is embodied in the opposition between the President and Miguel Angel Face. While the President represents sterility and destruction, his favorite, Miguel Angel Face, embodies fertility, a positive and generative force of nature. Callan notes that Miguel Angel Face's transformation from the President's favorite to a positive generative force is not deliberate. Instead, Callan argues that "it results from the birth of true love in his formerly barren heart. However, he is too engrossed in his love to notice the shift in his relationship with the President." The President, not surprisingly, identifies himself candidly with death. Examples from the novel include the death sentences he gives to Abel Carvajal (for a crime the President is fully aware the man did not commit) and to Lucio Vasquez, a man in his service that carried out his wish for the Zany to be killed and yet is still executed. In contrast to the President, Callan highlights Miguel Angel Face's association with love. The love that Miguel Angel Face develops for Camila identifies him with love and life, and leads to procreation—the birth of his son. Rosello argues that even before his transformation, Miguel Angel Face was aware of the President's destructive nature. As such, Rosello argues that Miguel Angel Face "knew from the beginning that the only 'safety' in the President's world is a form of self destruction: only by losing his identity and letting the President's mind invade his own could he hope to remain alive". So, when he failed to comply, he did indeed lose his life.

In Guatemala, received significant attention from the date of its first publication. Mostly this was from other left-wing writers and intellectuals, who recognized and praised both its stylistic innovation and its political commitment, if sometimes with the complaint that the novel was overly influenced by European modernism. But, as Dante Liano observes, "those in power have not been able to stand Asturias's voice".

Critical reception elsewhere in Latin America was also enthusiastic. One of the book's first reviewers was <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Rosa%20Oliver">María Rosa Oliver</a>, writing in the influential Argentine journal "<a href="Sur%20%28magazine%29">Sur</a>" shortly after the novel's second edition was produced in Buenos Aires. She particularly praises the plot: the fact that the novel is more than simply a lyrical still life. Rather, she argues, "stirs our five senses." And her conclusion stresses the book's Latin American qualities, arguing that it "enchants us, stirs us, moves us, and softens us all at the same time, producing much the same effect as when we travel, eyes and heart wide open, around these Latin American lands or the pages that tell their history."

Before long the novel's fame spread around the world. The first award Asturias received for was the French <a href="Prix%20du%20Meilleur%20Livre%20%C3%89tranger">Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger</a> in 1952. has steadily garnered further acclaim. In the words of literary scholar Jack Himelblau, the book is "an avant-garde and critically significant novel in the history of Spanish-American fiction" and Latin American history and literature scholar Charles Macune includes in a list of prominent translated Latin American novels. For Macune, novels and novelists of Latin America are "both history makers as well as reflections of the region's history". Unlike Latin American newspapers and archival materials, translated Latin American novels are far more accessible to readers without a knowledge of Spanish. In fact, Macune shows that has been well-received not only in its original Spanish but also in its English translation.

In December 1967 Asturias won the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for his life's work, including . Upon receiving the prize, he gave a lecture regarding Latin American literature as both "testimony" and "instrument for struggle". In particular, he spoke about the possibility of forging a new style of novel in Latin America, drawing on the region's indigenous heritage. This new style would make the novel a vehicle of hope and light in what he termed "this night that threatens us now". It would be "the affirmation of the optimism of those writers that defied the Inquisition, opening a breach in the conscience of the people for the march of the Liberators".

The Nobel Prize Committee, in awarding the prize, described in the following terms:
This magnificent and tragic satire criticizes the prototype of the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places at the beginning of the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.

Asturias's home country celebrated his international recognition. In Guatemala his face soon adorned postage stamps, a street was named after him, and he received a medal. According to Kjell Strömberg in "The 1967 Prize", "the whole of his little country was given over to rejoicing". Further admiration was expressed throughout Latin America, where Asturias's Nobel Prize was viewed as an accomplishment for Latin American literature as a whole, rather than the achievement of a single author or country. As scholar Richard Jewell notes, there had been substantial criticism that Latin American writers were being ignored by the Nobel committee. Beginning with Miguel Ángel Asturias in 1967, however, the academy selected four Latin American writers within twenty-four years.

Biographer <a href="Gregory%20Rabassa">Gregory Rabassa</a>, who has translated other works by Asturias, highlights the effects of the Nobel Prize on Asturias's subsequent work, saying, "[h]is winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967 gave him a long-awaited financial independence that ... enabled him to withdraw to his writing and the many aims and possibilities that [had] been on his mind for so many years".

 has been adapted into three Spanish-language films and one play. The first of the films, filmed in black and white, was made in 1970, by Argentine director Marcos Madanes. It was originally shown at the 1970 <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>. The cast included <a href="Pedro%20Buchardo">Pedro Buchardo</a> as the President, <a href="Luis%20Brandoni">Luis Brandoni</a> as Miguel and <a href="Alejandra%20Dapassano">Alejandra Dapassano</a> as Camila. As in Asturias's novel, the action is instigated when the village idiot kills a jeering army colonel, and in response, the president decides to blame the murder on a political adversary, but from that point on the film diverges from the novel. In the film, an operative is sent to spread rumors about the accused but instead he falls in love with the accused man's daughter. Once this happens, the operative defies his loyalty to the president and helps the daughter and her father incite a revolution with what he knows about the corrupt leader. Asturias himself complained about the film: he "sent a telegram to the Venice Film Festival denying permission to show the feature, but the letter arrived a day late. The unfortunate audience then had to endure this malodorous melodrama."

The play was also critically acclaimed, receiving many awards and has been written of as the zenith of a "Golden Age" of Guatemalan theatre. The play engaged the politics of the time (the <a href="Institutional%20Democratic%20Party">Institutional Democratic Party</a> was then in power), and Carrillo felt it necessary at first to attribute the script to the pseudonym "Franz Metz", and had photos taken of someone portraying "Metz" with the director; on opening night, secret police came inquiring after the address of Asturias (who had died earlier that year), and the government started paying attention to the previews of plays in the next year.

The second film adaptation, in 1983, was directed by <a href="Manuel%20Octavio%20G%C3%B3mez">Manuel Octavio Gómez</a>, and was one of the last films made by this prolific Cuban film director. It starred French actor <a href="Michel%20Auclair">Michel Auclair</a> as "El Presidente".

The most recent film adaptation, directed by Venezuelan <a href="R%C3%B3mulo%20Guardia">Rómulo Guardia Granier</a> and produced by <a href="RCTV">RCTV</a> ("Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional"), was released in November 2007 and is the first film produced by RCTV in more than twenty years. This version paints the picture of a hopeless love story—one that is unable to succeed under the terrorizing and corrupt dictatorship. It therefore plays up what is only hinted at in the novel itself, the possibility that the President is driven at least in part by sexual desire.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of this film version is the way in which it was immediately taken as a commentary on the present government of Venezuela. Director Granier divulged in an interview, "We had to film in secret in order to avoid being shut down." Antonio Blanco, who also worked on this adaptation, said that: "We plan to market the film as a Guatemalan story to avoid any problems with authorities." RCTV lost its terrestrial broadcasting rights in mid-2007 when the government of <a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a> (who was democratically elected, but accused by opponents of harboring dictatorial tendencies) did not renew the network's license.

"Selected editions":

A manuscript exists of the first draft of , which at that time (July 1933) was entitled "Tohil". This is now in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">National Library of Paris</a>. "Tohil's Dance" is the title of chapter 37 of the finished work. The main differences between this draft and the published book can be found in chapter 12 ("Camila") and in the fact that the former lacks the latter's epilogue.

The first published version of came out in 1946, while Asturias was semi-exiled in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. The publication was financed by Asturias himself, aided by his parents, as the manuscript had been rejected by the publishers to whom he had sent it. This first edition suffered from numerous typographical errors. These errors were only rectified in the third edition, published in Argentina in 1952, which also included numerous substantial changes introduced by Asturias himself. This edition is, therefore, the first definitive version of the book. As noted by Gerald Martin, editor of the 2000 critical edition, "measured in terms of its decisive historical influence," the third (Losada) edition is "easily the most important of them all".

Atheism

Atheism is, in the broadest sense, the absence of <a href="belief">belief</a> in the existence of <a href="Deity">deities</a>. Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with <a href="theism">theism</a>, which, in its most general form, is the belief that <a href="Existence%20of%20God">at least one deity exists</a>.

The <a href="etymology">etymological</a> root for the word "atheism" originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek ("atheos"), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society, those who were forsaken by the gods, or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods. The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed. The actual term "atheism" emerged first in the 16th century. With the spread of <a href="freethought">freethought</a>, <a href="skeptical%20inquiry">skeptical inquiry</a>, and subsequent increase in <a href="criticism%20of%20religion">criticism of religion</a>, application of the term narrowed in scope. The <a href="List%20of%20atheist%20philosophers">first individuals</a> to identify themselves using the word "atheist" lived in the 18th century during the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. The <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, noted for its "unprecedented atheism," witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human <a href="reason">reason</a>. The French Revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically.

Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of <a href="Existence%20of%20God%23Empirical%20arguments">empirical evidence</a>, the <a href="problem%20of%20evil">problem of evil</a>, the <a href="argument%20from%20inconsistent%20revelations">argument from inconsistent revelations</a>, the rejection of concepts that cannot <a href="Falsifiability">be falsified</a>, and the <a href="argument%20from%20nonbelief">argument from nonbelief</a>. Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more <a href="parsimonious">parsimonious</a> position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities; therefore, they argue that the <a href="Philosophic%20burden%20of%20proof">burden of proof</a> lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism. Although some atheists have adopted <a href="Secularism">secular</a> philosophies (e.g. <a href="secular%20humanism">secular humanism</a>), there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.

Since conceptions of atheism vary, accurate estimations of current <a href="Demographics%20of%20atheism">numbers of atheists</a> are difficult. According to global <a href="WIN/GIA">Win-Gallup International</a> studies, 13% of respondents were "convinced atheists" in 2012,<ref name="WIN/GIA"></ref> 11% were "convinced atheists" in 2015, and in 2017, 9% were "convinced atheists". However, other researchers have advised caution with WIN/Gallup figures since other surveys which have used the same wording for decades and have a bigger sample size have consistently reached lower figures. An older survey by the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) in 2004 recorded atheists as comprising 8% of the world's population. Other older estimates have indicated that atheists comprise 2% of the world's population, while the <a href="Irreligion">irreligious</a> add a further 12%. According to these polls, Europe and East Asia are the regions with the highest rates of atheism. In 2015, 61% of people in China reported that <a href="Irreligion%20in%20China">they were atheists</a>. The figures for a 2010 <a href="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a> survey in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) reported that 20% of the EU population claimed not to believe in "any sort of spirit, God or life force".

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify "atheism", contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with <a href="agnosticism">agnosticism</a>, and has also been contrasted with it. A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining "atheism" arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like "deity" and "god". The plurality of wildly different <a href="conceptions%20of%20God">conceptions of God</a> and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the <a href="paganism">pagan</a> deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as "theism" came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any <a href="spirituality">spiritual</a>, <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a>, or <a href="Transcendence%20%28religion%29">transcendental</a> concepts, such as those of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, and <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a>.

Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, <a href="Baron%20d%27Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a> said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."
Similarly, <a href="George%20H.%20Smith">George H. Smith</a> (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist." "Implicit atheism" is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and "explicit atheism" is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", <a href="Ernest%20Nagel">Ernest Nagel</a> contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism. <a href="Graham%20Oppy">Graham Oppy</a> classifies as "innocents" those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be <a href="Infant%20cognitive%20development">one-month-old babies</a>, humans with severe traumatic <a href="Brain%20injury">brain injuries</a>, or patients with <a href="dementia">advanced dementia</a>.

Philosophers such as <a href="Antony%20Flew">Antony Flew</a>
and <a href="Michael%20Martin%20%28philosopher%29">Michael Martin</a> have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms "weak" and "strong" are relatively recent, while the terms "negative" and "positive" atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature and in Catholic apologetics.
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that <a href="agnosticism">agnosticism</a> <a href="logical%20consequence">entails</a> negative atheism, many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,
which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a <a href="leap%20of%20faith">leap of faith</a>.
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven "<a href="faith%23Faith%20in%20world%20religions">religious</a>" propositions deserve as much disbelief as all "other" unproven propositions,
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.
Australian philosopher <a href="J.J.C.%20Smart">J.J.C. Smart</a> even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized <a href="philosophical%20skepticism">philosophical skepticism</a> which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."
Consequently, some atheist authors such as <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a <a href="spectrum%20of%20theistic%20probability">spectrum of theistic probability</a>—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".

Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called "theistic <a href="innatism">innatism</a>"—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make <a href="deathbed%20conversion">deathbed conversion</a>s, or that "<a href="there%20are%20no%20atheists%20in%20foxholes">there are no atheists in foxholes</a>".
There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book "<a href="Letter%20to%20a%20Christian%20Nation">Letter to a Christian Nation</a>", <a href="Sam%20Harris%20%28author%29">Sam Harris</a> wrote:
In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-<a href="Astrology">astrologer</a>" or a "non-<a href="Alchemy">alchemist</a>". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.

Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a <a href="Pragmatism">pragmatic</a> life. This view is related to <a href="apatheism">apatheism</a> and <a href="practical%20atheism">practical atheism</a>.

Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God. The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of <a href="immanence">immanence</a>, divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's <a href="consciousness">consciousness</a> is locked in the <a href="Subject%20%28philosophy%29">subject</a>. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The <a href="Rationalism">rationalistic</a> agnosticism of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a> and the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. <a href="Skepticism">Skepticism</a>, based on the ideas of <a href="David%20Hume">Hume</a>, asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion". The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or <a href="ontology">ontological</a>, including <a href="ignosticism">ignosticism</a>, assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." <a href="Theological%20noncognitivism">Theological noncognitivism</a> holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers <a href="Alfred%20Ayer">A.J. Ayer</a> and <a href="Theodore%20M.%20Drange">Theodore M. Drange</a> reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.

Philosopher, <a href="Zofia%20Zdybicka">Zofia Zdybicka</a> writes:

Some atheists hold the view that the various <a href="conceptions%20of%20God">conceptions of gods</a>, such as the <a href="personal%20god">personal god</a> of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present <a href="existence%20of%20God%23Deductive%20arguments">deductive arguments</a> against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, <a href="immutability%20%28theology%29">immutability</a>, <a href="omniscience">omniscience</a>, <a href="omnipresence">omnipresence</a>, <a href="omnipotence">omnipotence</a>, <a href="omnibenevolence">omnibenevolence</a>, <a href="transcendence%20%28philosophy%29">transcendence</a>, personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, <a href="justice">justice</a>, and <a href="mercy">mercy</a>.

<a href="Theodicy">Theodicean</a> atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an <a href="omniscience">omniscient</a>, <a href="omnipotence">omnipotent</a>, and <a href="omnibenevolence">omnibenevolent</a> God is not compatible with a world where there is <a href="problem%20of%20evil">evil</a> and <a href="suffering">suffering</a>, and where divine love is <a href="Divine%20hiddenness">hidden</a> from many people.
A similar argument is attributed to <a href="Siddhartha%20Gautama">Siddhartha Gautama</a>, the founder of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.

Philosopher <a href="Ludwig%20Andreas%20Feuerbach">Ludwig Feuerbach</a>
and psychoanalyst <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many <a href="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>.
<a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>, influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."

Atheism is not mutually exclusive with respect to some religious and spiritual belief systems, including <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Syntheism">Syntheism</a>, <a href="Ra%C3%ABlism">Raëlism</a>, and <a href="Paganism%20%28contemporary%20religions%29">Neopagan</a> <a href="New%20religious%20movement">movements</a>
such as <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>.
<a href="%C4%80stika">Āstika</a> schools in <a href="Atheism%20in%20Hinduism">Hinduism</a> hold atheism to be a valid path to <a href="moksha">moksha</a>, but extremely difficult, for the atheist can not expect any help from <a href="Gods%20in%20Hinduism">the divine</a> on their journey.
Jainism believes the universe is eternal and has no need for a creator deity, however <a href="Tirthankaras">Tirthankaras</a> are revered that can transcend space and time

and have more power than the god <a href="Indra">Indra</a>.
<a href="Secular%20Buddhism">Secular Buddhism</a> does not advocate belief in gods. Early Buddhism was atheistic as <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>'s path involved no mention of gods. <a href="God%20in%20Buddhism">Later conceptions</a> of Buddhism consider Buddha himself a god, suggest adherents can attain godhood, and revere <a href="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>s
and <a href="Eternal%20Buddha">Eternal Buddha</a>.

<a href="Apophatic%20theology">Apophatic theology</a> is often assessed as being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot say truly that God exists. "The comparison is crude, however, for conventional atheism treats the existence of God as a predicate that can be denied (“God is nonexistent”), whereas negative theology denies that God has predicates". "God or the Divine is" without being able to attribute qualities about "what He is" would be the prerequisite of <a href="positive%20theology">positive theology</a> in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism. "Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".

<a href="Axiology">Axiological</a>, or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as <a href="Human%20nature">humanity</a>. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness. One of the most common <a href="criticism%20of%20atheism">criticisms of atheism</a> has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to <a href="moral%20relativism">moral relativism</a> and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation, or renders life <a href="meaning%20of%20life%20%28religious%29">meaningless</a> and miserable. <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> argued this view in his "<a href="Pens%C3%A9es">Pensées</a>".

French philosopher <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> identified himself as a representative of an "<a href="atheist%20existentialism">atheist existentialism</a>"
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs ... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and ... this being is man."
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no "a priori rules" or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".

Sociologist <a href="Phil%20Zuckerman">Phil Zuckerman</a> analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies.
His findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US, "atheists and secular people" are less <a href="Nationalism">nationalistic</a>, prejudiced, <a href="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a>, <a href="Racism">racist</a>, dogmatic, <a href="Ethnocentrism">ethnocentric</a>, closed-minded, and authoritarian, and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average. In the most religious states, the murder rate is higher than average.

People who self-identify as atheists are often assumed to be <a href="irreligion">irreligious</a>, but some sects within major religions reject the existence of a personal, <a href="creator%20deity">creator deity</a>.
In recent years, certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers, such as <a href="atheist%20Jew">atheistic</a> or <a href="humanistic%20Judaism">humanistic Judaism</a>
and <a href="Christian%20atheism">Christian atheists</a>.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the <a href="moral%20universalism">moral universalism</a> of <a href="humanism">humanism</a>, which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to <a href="moral%20nihilism">moral nihilism</a>, which holds that morality is meaningless. Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.

Philosophers such as <a href="Slavoj%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEek">Slavoj Žižek</a>, <a href="Alain%20de%20Botton">Alain de Botton</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Bard">Alexander Bard</a> and <a href="Jan%20S%C3%B6derqvist">Jan Söderqvist</a>, have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

According to Plato's <a href="Euthyphro%20dilemma">Euthyphro dilemma</a>, the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. <a href="Divine%20command%20theory">The argument that morality must be derived from God</a>, and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as <a href="divine%20law">divine law</a>s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a <a href="false%20analogy">false analogy</a>, and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.
<a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."

There exist <a href="Normative%20ethics">normative ethical systems</a> that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity. Some include <a href="virtue%20ethics">virtue ethics</a>, <a href="social%20contract">social contract</a>, <a href="Kantian%20ethics">Kantian ethics</a>, <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, and <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a>. <a href="Sam%20Harris%20%28author%29">Sam Harris</a> has proposed that moral prescription (ethical rule making) is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy, but that we can meaningfully practice a <a href="science%20of%20morality">science of morality</a>. Any such scientific system must, nevertheless, respond to the criticism embodied in the <a href="naturalistic%20fallacy">naturalistic fallacy</a>.

Philosophers <a href="Susan%20Neiman">Susan Neiman</a>
and <a href="Julian%20Baggini">Julian Baggini</a>
(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.
The contemporary British political philosopher <a href="Martin%20Cohen%20%28philosopher%29">Martin Cohen</a> has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers. Cohen extends this argument in more detail in "Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao", where he argues that the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.

Some prominent atheists—most recently <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>, <a href="Sam%20Harris%20%28author%29">Sam Harris</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, and following such thinkers as <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="Robert%20G.%20Ingersoll">Robert G. Ingersoll</a>, <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, and novelist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Saramago">José Saramago</a>—have criticized religions, citing harmful aspects of religious practices and doctrines.

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the <a href="opium%20of%20the%20people">opium of the people</a>". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo." <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a> said that "every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness ... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind. Millions of sins, filthy deeds, acts of violence and physical contagions ... are far less dangerous than the subtle, spiritual idea of God decked out in the smartest ideological constumes ..."

Sam Harris criticizes Western religion's reliance on divine authority as lending itself to <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a> and <a href="dogma">dogma</a>tism.
There is a correlation between <a href="religious%20fundamentalism">religious fundamentalism</a> and <a href="Extrinsic%20religious%20orientation">extrinsic religion</a> (when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests) and authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice.
These arguments—combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate the dangers of religion, such as the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>, <a href="inquisition">inquisition</a>s, <a href="Witch-hunt">witch trials</a>, and <a href="Religious%20terrorism">terrorist attacks</a>—have been used in response to claims of beneficial effects of belief in religion.
Believers counter-argue that some <a href="state%20atheism">regimes that espouse atheism</a>, such as the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, have also been guilty of mass murder. In response to those claims, atheists such as Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have stated that Stalin's atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, and that while Stalin and Mao happened to be atheists, they did not do their deeds in the name of atheism.

In early <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a>, the adjective ' (, from the <a href="privative%20a">privative ἀ-</a> + "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term <a href="%3Awikt%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B2%CE%AE%CF%82">ἀσεβής</a> (') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also ('), "atheism". <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> transliterated the Greek word into the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "". The term found frequent use in the debate between <a href="early%20Christianity">early Christians</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion">Hellenists</a>, with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.

The term "atheist" (from Fr. ""), in the sense of "one who ... denies the existence of God or gods",
predates "atheism" in English, being first found as early as 1566,
and again in 1571.
"Atheist" as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as 1577.
The term "atheism" was derived from the <a href="French%20language">French</a> "", and appears in English about 1587.
An earlier work, from about 1534, used the term "atheonism".
Related words emerged later: "deist" in 1621,
"theist" in 1662,
"<a href="deism">deism</a>" in 1675,
and "<a href="theism">theism</a>" in 1678.
At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term "theism" came to be contrasted with deism.

<a href="Karen%20Armstrong">Karen Armstrong</a> writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for <a href="polemic">polemic</a> ... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling "himself" an atheist."

"Atheism" was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a> <a href="Abrahamic%20god">Abrahamic god</a>.
In the 20th century, <a href="globalization">globalization</a> contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".

While the earliest-found usage of the term "atheism" is in 16th-century <a href="France">France</a>, ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the <a href="Vedic%20period">Vedic period</a> and the <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>.

Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the <a href="historical%20Vedic%20religion">historical Vedic religion</a>.
Among the six <a href="Astika%20and%20Nastika">orthodox</a> schools of Hindu philosophy, <a href="Samkhya">Samkhya</a>, the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early <a href="Mimamsa">Mimamsa</a> also rejected the notion of God.
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical <a href="C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka">Cārvāka</a> (or "Lokāyata") school that originated in <a href="India">India</a> around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek <a href="Cyrenaic%20school">Cyrenaic school</a>. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as <a href="nastika">heterodox</a> due to its rejection of the authority of <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include <a href="Samkhya">Classical Samkhya</a> and <a href="Mimamsa">Purva Mimamsa</a>. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in India.

Western atheism has its roots in <a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">pre-Socratic</a> <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophy</a>, but atheism in the modern sense was nonexistent or extremely rare in ancient Greece. Pre-Socratic <a href="Atomism">Atomists</a> such as <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> attempted to explain the world in a purely <a href="materialism">materialistic</a> way and interpreted religion as a human reaction to natural phenomena, but did not explicitly deny the gods' existence. In the late fifth century BCE, the Greek <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyric poet</a> <a href="Diagoras%20of%20Melos">Diagoras of Melos</a> was sentenced to death in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> under the charge of being a "godless person" (ἄθεος) after he made fun of the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>, but he fled the city to escape punishment. Later writers have cited Diagoras as the "first atheist", but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word.

<a href="Sisyphus%20fragment">A fragment</a> from the lost <a href="satyr%20play">satyr play</a> "Sisyphus", which has been attributed to both <a href="Critias">Critias</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, claims that a clever man invented "the fear of the gods" in order to frighten people into behaving morally. This statement, however, originally did not mean that the gods themselves were nonexistent, but rather that their powers were a hoax. Atheistic statements have also been attributed to the philosopher <a href="Prodicus">Prodicus</a>. <a href="Philodemus">Philodemus</a> reports that Prodicus believed that "the gods of popular belief do not exist nor do they know, but primitive man, [out of admiration, deified] the fruits of the earth and virtually everything that contributed to his existence". <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a> has sometimes been taken to be an atheist, but rather espoused agnostic views, commenting that "Concerning the gods I am unable to discover whether they exist or not, or what they are like in form; for there are many hindrances to knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life."

The Athenian public associated Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE) with the trends in pre-Socratic philosophy towards naturalistic inquiry and the rejection of divine explanations for phenomena. <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>' comic play "<a href="The%20Clouds">The Clouds</a>" (performed 423 BCE) portrays Socrates as teaching his students that the traditional Greek deities do not exist. Socrates was later tried and executed under the charge of not believing in the gods of the state and instead worshipping foreign gods. Socrates himself vehemently denied the charges of atheism at his trial and all the surviving sources about him indicate that he was a very devout man, who prayed to the rising sun and believed that the <a href="Pythia">oracle at Delphi</a> spoke the word of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. <a href="Euhemerus">Euhemerus</a> ( 300 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures. Although not strictly an atheist, Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods".

The most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a> ( 300 BCE). Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see <a href="scientific%20determinism">scientific determinism</a>). Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed, he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs. The aim of the Epicureans was to attain "<a href="ataraxia">ataraxia</a>" ("peace of mind") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death. In the 3rd-century BCE, the Greek philosophers <a href="Theodorus%20the%20Atheist">Theodorus Cyrenaicus</a> and <a href="Strato%20of%20Lampsacus">Strato of Lampsacus</a> did not believe in the existence of gods. The Roman philosopher <a href="Sextus%20Empiricus">Sextus Empiricus</a> held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as <a href="Pyrrhonism">Pyrrhonism</a>—that nothing was inherently evil, and that ataraxia is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.

The meaning of "atheist" changed over the course of classical antiquity. <a href="Early%20Christianity">Early Christians</a> were widely reviled as "atheists" because they did not believe in the existence of the Graeco-Roman deities. During the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, Christians were executed for their rejection of the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20deities">Roman gods</a> in general and Emperor-worship in particular. When Christianity became the state religion of Rome under <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> in 381, <a href="Christian%20heresy">heresy</a> became a punishable offense.
During the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a> experienced a <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>. Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including <a href="Muhammad%20al%20Warraq">Muhammad al Warraq</a> (fl. 9th century), <a href="Ibn%20al-Rawandi">Ibn al-Rawandi</a> (827–911), <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakariya%20al-Razi">Al-Razi</a> (854–925), and <a href="Al-Ma%CA%BFarri">Al-Maʿarri</a> (973–1058). Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients" and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains." Despite their being relatively prolific writers, little of their work survives, mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim <a href="Apologetics">apologists</a> attempting to refute them. Other prominent Golden Age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well, although the current intellectual atmosphere in the Islamic world, and the scant evidence that survives from the era, make this point a contentious one today.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> (see <a href="Medieval%20Inquisition">Medieval Inquisition</a>); <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion. There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as <a href="Johannes%20Scotus%20Eriugena">Johannes Scotus Eriugena</a>, <a href="David%20of%20Dinant">David of Dinant</a>, <a href="Amalric%20of%20Bena">Amalric of Bena</a>, and the <a href="Brethren%20of%20the%20Free%20Spirit">Brethren of the Free Spirit</a> maintained Christian viewpoints with <a href="pantheism">pantheistic</a> tendencies. <a href="Nicholas%20of%20Cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</a> held to a form of <a href="fideism">fideism</a> he called "<a href="De%20Docta%20Ignorantia">docta ignorantia</a>" ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. <a href="William%20of%20Ockham">William of Ockham</a> inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his <a href="nominalism">nominalistic</a> limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine <a href="essence">essence</a> could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as <a href="John%20of%20Mirecourt">John of Mirecourt</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20of%20Autrecourt">Nicholas of Autrecourt</a> furthered this view. The resulting division between <a href="Faith%20and%20rationality">faith and reason</a> influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>, <a href="Jan%20Hus">Jan Hus</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>.

The <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed <a href="Appeal%20to%20authority">arguments from religious authority</a>. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>, <a href="Bonaventure%20des%20P%C3%A9riers">Bonaventure des Périers</a>, <a href="Michel%20de%20Montaigne">Michel de Montaigne</a>, and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais">François Rabelais</a>.

Historian <a href="Geoffrey%20Blainey">Geoffrey Blainey</a> wrote that the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches". <a href="Deism">Deism</a> gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his "Short Treatise on God".

<a href="Criticism%20of%20Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a> became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious <a href="malaise">malaise</a>, according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected <a href="divine%20providence">divine providence</a> in favor of a <a href="panentheistic">panentheistic</a> naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as <a href="John%20Toland%20%28Irish%20Philosopher%29">John Toland</a> who coined the term "pantheist".

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion <a href="Matthias%20Knutzen">Matthias Knutzen</a> in his three writings of 1674. He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher <a href="Kazimierz%20%C5%81yszczy%C5%84ski">Kazimierz Łyszczyński</a> and in the 1720s by the French priest <a href="Jean%20Meslier">Jean Meslier</a>. In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as <a href="Baron%20d%27Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a>, <a href="Jacques-Andr%C3%A9%20Naigeon">Jacques-André Naigeon</a>, and other <a href="French%20materialism">French materialists</a>. <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.

The philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>, and <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical <a href="arguments%20for%20the%20existence%20of%20God">arguments for the existence of God</a>.
Blainey notes that, although <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." In "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), the philosopher <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety ... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own ...". But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and ... it cannot prevail long".

<a href="Baron%20d%27Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a> was a prominent figure in the <a href="French%20Enlightenment">French Enlightenment</a> who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being "<a href="The%20System%20of%20Nature">The System of Nature</a>" (1770) but also "<a href="Christianity%20Unveiled">Christianity Unveiled</a>". One goal of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the <a href="Civil%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Clergy">Civil Constitution of the Clergy</a>. Attempts to enforce it led to <a href="anticlericalism">anti-clerical</a> violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the <a href="Thermidorian%20Reaction">Thermidorian Reaction</a>. The radical <a href="Jacobin%20Club">Jacobins</a> seized power in 1793, ushering in the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a>. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the <a href="Cult%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Being">Cult of the Supreme Being</a> as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding <a href="Jacques%20H%C3%A9bert">Jacques Hébert</a> instead sought to establish a <a href="Cult%20of%20Reason">Cult of Reason</a>, a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The <a href="Napoleonic%20era">Napoleonic era</a> further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of <a href="rationalism">rationalistic</a> and <a href="freethought">freethinking</a> philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including <a href="Ludwig%20Andreas%20Feuerbach">Ludwig Feuerbach</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a>, <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>, and <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>.

<a href="George%20Holyoake">George Holyoake</a> was the last person (1842) imprisoned in Great Britain due to atheist beliefs. Law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge. <a href="Stephen%20Law">Stephen Law</a> states that Holyoake "first coined the term 'secularism'".

Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>, <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">objectivism</a>, <a href="secular%20humanism">secular humanism</a>, <a href="nihilism">nihilism</a>, <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>, <a href="logical%20positivism">logical positivism</a>, <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="feminism">feminism</a>, and the general scientific and <a href="rationalist%20movement">rationalist movement</a>.
In addition, <a href="state%20atheism">state atheism</a> emerged in Eastern Europe and Asia during that period, particularly in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> under <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, and in <a href="China%23Communist%20Party">Communist China</a> under <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>. Atheist and anti-religious policies in the Soviet Union included <a href="Soviet%20anti-religious%20legislation">numerous legislative acts</a>, the outlawing of religious instruction in the schools, and the emergence of the <a href="League%20of%20Militant%20Atheists">League of Militant Atheists</a>. After Mao, the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China%23Stance%20on%20religion">Chinese Communist Party</a> remains an atheist organization, and regulates, but does not forbid, the practice of religion in mainland China.

While Geoffrey Blainey has written that "the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity", Richard Madsen has pointed out that Hitler and Stalin each opened and closed churches as a matter of political expedience, and Stalin softened his opposition to Christianity in order to improve public acceptance of his regime during the war. Blackford and Schüklenk have written that "the Soviet Union was undeniably an atheist state, and the same applies to Maoist China and Pol Pot's fanatical Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s. That does not, however, show that the atrocities committed by these totalitarian dictatorships were the result of atheist beliefs, carried out in the name of atheism, or caused primarily by the atheistic aspects of the relevant forms of communism."
Logical positivism and <a href="scientism">scientism</a> paved the way for <a href="neopositivism">neopositivism</a>, <a href="analytical%20philosophy">analytical philosophy</a>, <a href="structuralism">structuralism</a>, and <a href="naturalism%20%28philosophy%29">naturalism</a>. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological <a href="nominalism">nominalism</a>. Proponents such as <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. <a href="A.J.%20Ayer">A.J. Ayer</a> asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the <a href="Structural%20anthropology">applied structuralism</a> of <a href="Claude%20L%C3%A9vi-Strauss">Lévi-Strauss</a> sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. <a href="John%20Niemeyer%20Findlay">J.N. Findlay</a> and <a href="J.J.C.%20Smart">J.J.C. Smart</a> argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.

Other leaders like <a href="Periyar%20E.V.%20Ramasamy">Periyar E.V. Ramasamy</a>, a prominent atheist leader of <a href="India">India</a>, fought against <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a> for discriminating and dividing people in the name of <a href="caste">caste</a> and religion.
This was highlighted in 1956 when he arranged for the erection of a statue depicting a Hindu god in a humble representation and made <a href="antitheism">antitheistic</a> statements.

Atheist <a href="Vashti%20McCollum">Vashti McCollum</a> was the plaintiff in a landmark 1948 <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> case that struck down religious education in US public schools. <a href="Madalyn%20Murray%20O%27Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a> was perhaps one of the most influential American atheists; she brought forth the 1963 Supreme Court case "<a href="Murray%20v.%20Curlett">Murray v. Curlett</a>" which banned compulsory prayer in public schools. In 1966, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a>" magazine asked "Is God Dead?" in response to the <a href="God%20is%20dead%23Death%20of%20God%20theological%20movement">Death of God theological movement</a>, citing the estimation that nearly half of all people in the world lived under an anti-religious power, and millions more in Africa, Asia, and South America seemed to lack knowledge of the Christian view of theology. The <a href="Freedom%20From%20Religion%20Foundation">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> was co-founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter, <a href="Annie%20Laurie%20Gaylor">Annie Laurie Gaylor</a>, in 1976 in the United States, and incorporated nationally in 1978. It promotes the <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">separation of church and state</a>.

Since the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, the number of actively anti-religious regimes has reduced considerably. In 2006, Timothy Shah of the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Forum</a> noted "a worldwide trend across all major religious groups, in which God-based and faith-based movements in general are experiencing increasing confidence and influence vis-à-vis secular movements and ideologies."
However, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> and Phil Zuckerman consider this a myth and suggest that the actual situation is much more complex and nuanced.

A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths. Nonbelievers scored better on questions about tenets central to Protestant and Catholic faiths. Only Mormon and Jewish faithful scored as well as atheists and agnostics.

In 2012, the first "Women in Secularism" conference was held in Arlington, Virginia. Secular Woman was organized in 2012 as a national organization focused on nonreligious women. The <a href="Atheist%20feminism">atheist feminist movement</a> has also become increasingly focused on fighting sexism and <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a> within the atheist movement itself.
In August 2012, Jennifer McCreight (the organizer of <a href="Boobquake">Boobquake</a>) founded a movement within atheism known as Atheism Plus, or A+, that "applies skepticism to everything, including social issues like sexism, racism, politics, poverty, and crime".

In 2013 the first atheist monument on American government property was unveiled at the <a href="Bradford%20County%2C%20Florida">Bradford County</a> Courthouse in Florida: a 1,500-pound granite bench and plinth inscribed with quotes by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, and <a href="Madalyn%20Murray%20O%27Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a>.

"New Atheism" is the name that has been given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that "religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises."
The movement is commonly associated with <a href="Sam%20Harris%20%28author%29">Sam Harris</a>, <a href="Daniel%20C.%20Dennett">Daniel C. Dennett</a>, <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href="Victor%20J.%20Stenger">Victor J. Stenger</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, and to some extent <a href="Ayaan%20Hirsi%20Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>. Several best-selling books by these authors, published between 2004 and 2007, form the basis for much of the discussion of "New" Atheism.

In best selling books, the religiously motivated terrorist <a href="September%2011%20attacks">events of 9/11</a> and the partially successful attempts of the <a href="Discovery%20Institute">Discovery Institute</a> to change the American science curriculum to include <a href="creationist">creationist</a> ideas, together with support for those ideas from <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> in 2005, have been cited by authors such as Harris, Dennett, Dawkins, Stenger, and Hitchens as evidence of a need to move toward a more secular society.

It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists in the world. Respondents to religious-belief polls may define "atheism" differently or draw different distinctions between "atheism", non-religious beliefs, and non-theistic religious and spiritual beliefs. A Hindu atheist would declare oneself as a Hindu, although also being an atheist at the same time. A 2010 survey published in "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" found that the non-religious made up about 9.6% of the world's population, and atheists about 2.0%, with a very large majority based in Asia. This figure did not include those who follow atheistic religions, such as some Buddhists. The average annual change for atheism from 2000 to 2010 was −0.17%. Broad estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a god range from 500 million to 1.1 billion people worldwide.

According to global <a href="WIN/GIA">Win-Gallup International</a> studies, 13% of respondents were "convinced atheists" in 2012, 11% were "convinced atheists" in 2015, and in 2017, 9% were "convinced atheists". , the top 10 surveyed countries with people who viewed themselves as "convinced atheists" were <a href="China">China</a> (47%), <a href="Japan">Japan</a> (31%), the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> (30%), <a href="France">France</a> (29%), <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> (15%), <a href="Germany">Germany</a> (15%), <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (14%), <a href="Austria">Austria</a> (10%), <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> (10%), <a href="Australia">Australia</a> (10%), and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> (10%).

According to the 2010 Eurobarometer Poll, the percentage of those polled who agreed with the statement "you don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force" varied from a high percentage in France (40%), Czech Republic (37%), Sweden (34%), Netherlands (30%), and Estonia (29%); medium-high percentage in Germany (27%), Belgium (27%), UK (25%); to very low in Poland (5%), Greece (4%), Cyprus (3%), Malta (2%), and Romania (1%), with the European Union as a whole at 20%. In a 2012 Eurobarometer poll on discrimination in the European Union, 16% of those polled considered themselves non believers/agnostics and 7% considered themselves atheists.

According to a <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> survey in 2012 <a href="Irreligion">religiously unaffiliated</a> (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 18% of Europeans. According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).

There are another four countries or regions where the unaffiliated make up a majority of the population: <a href="Irreligion%20in%20North%20Korea">North Korea</a> (71%), <a href="Religion%20in%20Japan%23Thoughts%20and%20movements%20against%20organised%20religion">Japan</a> (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and China (52%).

According to the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, 30% of Australians have "no religion", a category that includes atheists.

In a 2013 census, 42% of <a href="New%20Zealanders">New Zealanders</a> reported having no religion, up from 30% in 1991. Men were more likely than women to report no religion.

According to the <a href="World%20Values%20Survey">World Values Survey</a>, 4.4% of Americans self-identified as atheists in 2014. However, the same survey showed that 11.1% of all respondents stated "no" when asked if they believed in God. In 1984, these same figures were 1.1% and 2.2%, respectively. According to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, 3.1% of the US adult population identify as atheist, up from 1.6% in 2007; and within the religiously unaffiliated (or "no religion") demographic, atheists made up 13.6%. According to the 2015 General Sociological Survey the number of atheists and agnostics in the US has remained relatively flat in the past 23 years since in 1991 only 2% identified as atheist and 4% identified as agnostic and in 2014 only 3% identified as atheists and 5% identified as agnostics.

According to the American Family Survey, 34% was found to be religiously unaffiliated in 2017 (23% 'nothing in particular', 6% agnostic, 5% atheist). According to the Pew Research Center, in 2014, 22.8% of the American population does not identify with a religion, including atheists (3.1%) and agnostics (4%). According to a PRRI survey, 24% of the population is unaffiliated. Atheists and agnostics combined make up about a quarter of this unaffiliated demographic.

In recent years, the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world. In major cities across the region, such as <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, atheists have been organizing in cafés and social media, despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments. A 2012 poll by Gallup International revealed that 5% of Saudis considered themselves to be "convinced atheists." However, very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances. According to one study, less than 1% did in Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Jordan; only 3% to 7% in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Palestine. When asked whether they have "seen or heard traces of atheism in [their] locality, community, and society" only about 3% to 8% responded yes in all the countries surveyed. The only exception was the UAE, with a percentage of 51%.

A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America. According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the <a href="Social%20democracy">social democracies</a> of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.

In a 2008 study, researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States. In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60. Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.

In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age, education and country of origin.

Statistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant. In addition, according to a 2016 <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral. Pew furthermore noted that, in a U.S. poll, atheists and Muslims tied for the lowest rating among the major religious demographics on a "<a href="feeling%20thermometer">feeling thermometer</a>".
