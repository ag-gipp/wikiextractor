Vidkun Quisling

Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling (; ; 18 July 1887 – 24 October 1945) was a Norwegian military officer and politician who nominally <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20government%20of%20Norway">headed the government of Norway</a> during the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">occupation of the country</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He first came to international prominence as a close collaborator of explorer <a href="Fridtjof%20Nansen">Fridtjof Nansen</a>, organizing <a href="humanitarian%20relief">humanitarian relief</a> during the <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">Russian famine of 1921</a> in <a href="Volga%20region">Povolzhye</a>. He was posted as a Norwegian diplomat to the Soviet Union, and for some time also managed British diplomatic affairs there. He returned to Norway in 1929, and served as <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Norway%29">Minister of Defence</a> in <a href="List%20of%20Norwegian%20governments">the governments</a> of <a href="Peder%20Kolstad">Peder Kolstad</a> (1931–32) and <a href="Jens%20Hundseid">Jens Hundseid</a> (1932–33), representing the <a href="Centre%20Party%20%28Norway%29">Farmers' Party</a>.

In 1933, Quisling left the Farmers' Party and founded the fascist party "<a href="Nasjonal%20Samling">Nasjonal Samling</a>" (National Union). Although he achieved some popularity after his attacks on the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">political left</a>, his party failed to win any seats in the <a href="Storting">Storting</a> and by 1940 it was still little more than peripheral. On 9 April 1940, with the <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">German invasion of Norway</a> in progress, he attempted to seize power in the world's first radio-broadcast "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>," but failed after the Germans refused to support his government. From 1942 to 1945 he served as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Norway">Prime Minister of Norway</a>, heading the Norwegian state administration jointly with the German <a href="occupation%20of%20Norway%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">civilian administrator</a> <a href="Josef%20Terboven">Josef Terboven</a>. His pro-Nazi <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a>, known as the <a href="Quisling%20regime">Quisling regime</a>, was dominated by ministers from Nasjonal Samling. The <a href="Collaborationism">collaborationist</a> government participated in Germany's genocidal <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a>. 

Quisling was put on trial during the <a href="legal%20purge%20in%20Norway%20after%20World%20War%20II">legal purge in Norway after World War II</a>. He was found guilty of charges including <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>, <a href="murder">murder</a> and <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> against the Norwegian state, and was sentenced to <a href="Capital%20Punishment">death</a>. He was <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">executed by firing squad</a> at <a href="Akershus%20Fortress">Akershus Fortress</a>, Oslo, on 24 October 1945. The word "<a href="quisling">quisling</a>" became a byword for "collaborator" or "traitor" in several languages, reflecting the contempt with which Quisling's conduct has been regarded, both at the time and since his death.

Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling () was born on 18 July 1887 in <a href="Fyresdal">Fyresdal</a>, in the Norwegian county of <a href="Telemark">Telemark</a>. He was the son of <a href="Church%20of%20Norway">Church of Norway</a> pastor and <a href="genealogist">genealogist</a> Jon Lauritz Qvisling (1844–1930) and his wife Anna Caroline Bang (1860–1941), the daughter of Jørgen Bang, <a href="ship-owner">ship-owner</a> and at the time the richest man in the town of <a href="Grimstad">Grimstad</a> in South Norway. The elder Quisling had lectured in Grimstad in the 1870s; one of his pupils was Bang, whom he married on 28 May 1886, following a long engagement. The newly-wed couple promptly moved to Fyresdal, where Vidkun and his younger siblings were born.

The family name derives from "Quislinus," a <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised name</a> invented by Quisling's ancestor Lauritz Ibsen Quislin (1634–1703), based on the village of Kvislemark near <a href="Slagelse">Slagelse</a>, Denmark, whence he had emigrated. Having two brothers and a sister, the young Quisling was "shy and quiet but also loyal and helpful, always friendly, occasionally breaking into a warm smile." Private letters later found by historians also indicate a warm and affectionate relationship between the family members. From 1893 to 1900, his father was a <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> for the <a href="Str%C3%B8ms%C3%B8">Strømsø</a> borough in <a href="Drammen">Drammen</a>. Here, Vidkun went to school for the first time. He was bullied by other students at the school for his Telemark dialect, but proved a successful student. In 1900, the family moved to <a href="Skien">Skien</a> when his father was appointed <a href="Provost%20%28religion%29">provost</a> of the city.

Academically Quisling proved talented in <a href="humanities">humanities</a>, particularly history, and <a href="natural%20sciences">natural sciences</a>; he specialised in mathematics. At this point, however, his life had no clear direction. In 1905, Quisling enrolled at the <a href="Norwegian%20Military%20Academy">Norwegian Military Academy</a>, having received the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants that year. Transferring in 1906 to the <a href="Norwegian%20Military%20College">Norwegian Military College</a>, he graduated with the highest score since the college's inception in 1817, and was rewarded by an audience with <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">the King</a>. On 1 November 1911, he joined the army General Staff. Norway was neutral in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>; Quisling detested the peace movement, though the high human cost of the war did temper his views. In March 1918, he was sent to Russia as an attaché at the Norwegian <a href="legation">legation</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Petrograd</a>, to take advantage of the five years he had spent studying the country. Though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced, Quisling nonetheless concluded that "the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s have got an extraordinarily strong hold on Russian society" and marvelled at how <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> had managed to mobilise the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> forces so well; by contrast, in granting too many rights to the people of Russia, the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Russian Provisional Government</a> under <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> had brought about its own downfall. When the legation was recalled in December 1918, Quisling became the Norwegian military's expert on Russian affairs.

In September 1919, Quisling departed Norway to become an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time at the request of explorer and humanitarian <a href="Fridtjof%20Nansen">Fridtjof Nansen</a>, and in January 1922 arrived in the <a href="Ukrainian%20SSR">Ukrainian</a> capital <a href="Kharkov">Kharkov</a> to help with the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21 August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.

Having left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and Asja returned to Kharkov in February 1923 to prolong aid efforts, with Nansen describing Quisling's work as "absolutely indispensable." Quisling found the situation much improved and, with no fresh challenges, found it a more boring trip than his last. He did however meet <a href="Maria%20Quisling">Maria Vasiljevna Pasetchnikova</a> (), a Ukrainian more than ten years his junior. Her diaries from the time "indicate a blossoming love affair" during the summer of 1923, despite Quisling's marriage to Asja the year before. She recalled that she was impressed by his fluent command of the Russian language, his Aryan appearance, and his gracious demeanour. Quisling apparently married Pasetchnikova in Kharkov on 10 September 1923, although no legal documentation has been discovered. Quisling's biographer, Dahl, believes that in all likelihood the second marriage was never official. Regardless, the couple behaved as though they were married, and celebrated their wedding anniversary. Soon after the wedding, the aid mission came to an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the summer of 1923 onwards they planned to spend a year in Paris. Maria wanted to see Western Europe; Quisling wanted to get some rest following bouts of stomach pain that had lasted all winter.

The stay in Paris required a temporary discharge from the army, which Quisling slowly grew to understand was permanent: army cutbacks meant that there would be no position available for him when he returned. Quisling devoted much of his time in the French capital to study, reading works of political theory and working on his philosophical project, which he called "Universism." On 2 October 1923, he persuaded the Oslo daily newspaper "<a href="Tidens%20Tegn">Tidens Tegn</a>" to publish an article he had written calling for <a href="diplomatic%20recognition">diplomatic recognition</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20government">Soviet government</a>. Quisling's stay in Paris did not last as long as planned, and in late 1923 he started work on Nansen's new <a href="repatriation">repatriation</a> project in the Balkans, arriving in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> in November. He spent the next two months travelling constantly with his wife Maria. In January she returned to Paris to look after Asja, who took on the role of the couple's foster-daughter; Quisling joined them in February.

In the summer of 1924, the trio returned to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in <a href="Nice%2C%20France">Nice</a> and never returned. Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit. Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's <a href="militia">militia</a> to protect the country against <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> attacks, and asked members of the movement whether they would like to know what information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the far-left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time "unemployed and dispirited ... deeply resentful of the General Staff ... [and] in the process of becoming politically more radical." Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as "a fusion of socialism and nationalism," with definite sympathies for the Soviets in Russia.

In June 1925, Nansen once again provided Quisling with employment. The pair began a tour of <a href="Armenian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Armenia</a>, where they hoped to help repatriate native Armenians via a number of projects proposed for funding by the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. Despite Quisling's substantial efforts, however, the projects were all rejected. In May 1926, Quisling found another job with long-time friend and fellow Norwegian <a href="Frederik%20Prytz">Frederik Prytz</a> in Moscow, working as a liaison between Prytz and the Soviet authorities who owned half of Prytz's firm Onega Wood. He stayed in the job until Prytz prepared to close down the business in early 1927, when Quisling found new employment as a diplomat. British diplomatic affairs in Russia were being managed by Norway, and he became their new legation secretary; Maria joined him late in 1928. A massive scandal broke when Quisling and Prytz were accused of using diplomatic channels to smuggle millions of <a href="roubles">roubles</a> onto the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>s, a much-repeated claim that was later used to support a charge of "<a href="moral%20bankruptcy">moral bankruptcy</a>," but neither it nor the charge that Quisling spied for the British has ever been substantiated.

The harder line now developing in Russian politics led Quisling to distance himself from Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed an attempt by Nansen to help with the 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) for his services to Britain, an honour revoked by <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> in 1940. By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Romania%29">Romanian Crown Order</a> and the Yugoslav <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Sava">Order of St. Sava</a> for his earlier humanitarian efforts.

Having spent nine of the previous twelve years abroad, but with no practical experience in party politics outside the Norwegian Army, Quisling returned to Norway in December 1929, bringing with him a plan for change he termed "Norsk Aktion," meaning "Norwegian Action." The planned organisation consisted of national, regional and local units with the intention of recruiting in the style of the <a href="Soviet%20Communist%20Party">Soviet Communist Party</a>. Like "<a href="Action%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Action Française</a>" of the French right, it advocated radical constitutional changes. The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Norway">Parliament of Norway</a>, or "Storting," was to become <a href="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> with the second chamber made up of Soviet-style elected representatives from the working population. Quisling focused more on organisation than the practicalities of government; for instance, all members of "Norsk Aktion" were to have their own designation in a militaristic hierarchy.

Quisling next sold a large number of antiques and works of art that he had acquired cheaply in post-revolutionary Russia. His collection stretched to some 200 paintings, including works claimed to be by <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Goya</a>, <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a> and numerous other masters. The collection, including "veritable treasures," had been insured for almost 300,000 <a href="Norwegian%20krone">kroner</a>. In the spring of 1930, he again joined up with Prytz, who was back in Norway. They participated in regular group meetings that included middle-aged officers and business people, since described as "the textbook definition of a <a href="Fascism">Fascist</a> initiative group," through which Prytz appeared determined to launch Quisling into politics.

After Nansen died on 13 May 1930, Quisling used his friendship with the editor of the "Tidens Tegn" newspaper to get his analysis of Nansen onto the front page. The article was entitled "Politiske tanker ved Fridtjof Nansens død" ("Political Thoughts on the Death of Fridtjof Nansen") and was published on 24 May. In the article, he outlined ten points that would complete Nansen's vision as applied to Norway, among them "strong and just government" and a "greater emphasis on race and heredity." This theme was followed up in his new book, "Russia and Ourselves" (), which was serialised in "Tidens Tegn" during the autumn of 1930. Advocating war against Bolshevism, the openly racist book catapulted Quisling into the political limelight. Despite his earlier ambivalence, he took up a seat on the Oslo board of the previously Nansen-led <a href="Fatherland%20League%20%28Norway%29">Fatherland League</a>. Meanwhile, he and Prytz founded a new political movement, "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge," or "Nordic popular rising in Norway," with a central committee of 31 and Quisling as its "<a href="F%C3%BChrer">fører</a>" – a one-man executive committee – though Quisling seemed to have had no particular attachment to the term. The first meeting of the league took place on 17 March 1931, stating the purpose of the movement was to "eliminate the imported and depraved communist insurgency."

Quisling left "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge" in May 1931 to serve as defence minister in the <a href="Senterpartiet">Agrarian</a> government of <a href="Peder%20Kolstad">Peder Kolstad</a>, despite being neither an Agrarian nor a friend of Kolstad. He had been suggested to Kolstad for the post by <a href="Thorvald%20Aadahl">Thorvald Aadahl</a>, editor of the Agrarian newspaper "<a href="Nationen">Nationen</a>," who was in turn influenced by Prytz. The appointment came as a surprise to many in the Parliament of Norway. Quisling's first action in the post was to deal with the aftermath of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Menstad">Battle of Menstad</a>, an "extremely bitter" labour dispute, by sending in troops. After narrowly avoiding criticism by the left wing over his handling of the dispute, and the revelation of his earlier "militia" plans, Quisling turned his attention to the perceived threat posed by communists. He created a list of the <a href="Revolutionary%20Trade%20Union%20Opposition">Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition</a> leadership, who had been the alleged agitators at Menstad; a number of them were eventually charged with <a href="subversion">subversion</a> and violence against the police. Quisling's policies also resulted in the establishment of a permanent militia called the "Leidang" which, unlike the body he had previously planned, was to be counter-revolutionary. Despite the ready availability of junior officers in the reserve following defence cuts, only seven units were established in 1934, and funding restrictions meant that the enterprise included less than a thousand men before it faded away. Sometime during the period 1930–33, Quisling's first wife, Asja, received notice of the annulment of her marriage to him.

In mid-1932 "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge" was forced to confirm that even though Quisling remained in the cabinet, he would not become a member of the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the <a href="Nazi">National Socialism</a> model. This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator. After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged. In November 1932, Labour politician <a href="Johan%20Nygaardsvold">Johan Nygaardsvold</a> put this theory to Parliament, prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him. No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed. Quisling later indicated it was an attempt to steal military papers recently left by Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Kleen. The so-called "pepper affair" served to polarise opinion about Quisling, and government fears grew concerning reasonably open Soviet elements in Norway who had been active in promoting industrial unrest.

Following Kolstad's death in March 1932, Quisling retained his post as defence minister in the second Agrarian government under <a href="Jens%20Hundseid">Jens Hundseid</a> for political reasons, though they remained in bitter opposition throughout. Just as he had been under Kolstad, Quisling was involved in many of the spats that characterised Hundseid's government. On 8 April that year, Quisling had a chance to defend himself over the pepper affair in Parliament, but instead used the opportunity to attack the Labour and <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Norway">Communist</a> parties, claiming that named members were criminals and "enemies of our fatherland and our people." Support for Quisling from right-wing elements in Norwegian society rocketed overnight, and 153 distinguished signatories called for Quisling's claims to be investigated. In the coming months, tens of thousands of Norwegians followed suit and Quisling's summer was full of speeches to packed political rallies. In Parliament, however, Quisling's speech was viewed as political suicide; not only was his evidence weak, but questions were raised as to why the information had not been handed over much sooner if the revolutionary threat were so serious.

Over the course of 1932 and into 1933, Prytz's influence over "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge" weakened and lawyer <a href="Johan%20Bernhard%20Hjort">Johan Bernhard Hjort</a> assumed the leadership role. Hjort was keen to work with Quisling because of his new-found popularity, and they devised a new programme of right-wing policies including proscription of revolutionary parties including those funded by foreign bodies such as <a href="Comintern">Comintern</a>, the suspension of the voting rights for people in receipt of <a href="social%20welfare">social welfare</a>, agricultural debt relief, and an audit of public finances. In 1932, during the <a href="Olaf%20Kullmann">Kullmann Affair</a>, Quisling turned on the prime minister for questioning his hard-line stance over pacifist agitator Captain <a href="Olaf%20Kullmann">Olaf Kullmann</a>. In a memorandum laying out his proposals for economic and social reform distributed to the entire cabinet, Quisling called for the prime minister to stand down. As the government began to collapse, Quisling's personal popularity reached new heights; he was referred to as "man of the year," and there were expectations of forthcoming electoral success.

Despite the new programme, some of Quisling's circle still favoured a cabinet coup. He later said he had even considered the use of force to overthrow the government but, in late February, it was the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Norway%29">Liberal Party</a> that brought them down. With the assistance of Hjort and Prytz, "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge" quickly became a political party, "<a href="Nasjonal%20Samling">Nasjonal Samling</a>," or NS, literally "National Unity," ready to contest the forthcoming October election. Quisling was mildly disappointed and would have preferred to head a national movement, not just one of seven political parties. "Nasjonal Samling" soon afterwards announced it would support candidates from other parties if they supported its key aim of "establishing a strong and stable national government independent of ordinary party politics." Although not an overnight success in the already crowded political spectrum, the party slowly gained support. With its Nazi-inspired belief in the central authority of a strong "<a href="F%C3%BChrerprinzip">Führer</a>", as well as its powerful propaganda elements, it gained support from many among the Oslo upper classes, and began to give the impression that "big money" lay behind it.

Increased support also materialised when the "Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp," the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought financial aid from "Nasjonal Samling," who in turn gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, in part because of competition from the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28Norway%29">Conservative Party</a> for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of "Nasjonal Samling's" existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the <a href="Norwegian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201933">October elections</a>, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.

After the underwhelming election results, Quisling's attitude to negotiation and compromise hardened. A final attempt to form a coalition of the right in March 1934 came to nothing, and from late 1933, Quisling's "Nasjonal Samling" began to carve out its own form of national socialism. With no leader in Parliament, however, the party struggled to introduce the constitutional reform bill needed to achieve its lofty ambitions. When Quisling tried to introduce the bill directly, it was swiftly rejected, and the party went into decline. In the summer of 1935, headlines quoted Quisling telling opponents that "heads [would] roll" as soon as he achieved power. The threat irreparably damaged the image of his party, and over the following few months several high-ranking members resigned, including <a href="Kai%20Fjell">Kai Fjell</a> and Quisling's brother Jørgen.

Quisling began to familiarise himself with the international fascist movement, attending the <a href="1934%20Montreux%20Fascist%20conference">1934 Montreux Fascist conference</a> in December. For his party, the association with <a href="Italian%20fascism">Italian fascism</a> could not have come at a worse time, so soon after headlines of illegal <a href="Abyssinia%20crisis">Italian incursions into Abyssinia</a>. On his return trip from Montreux, he met Nazi <a href="ideologue">ideologue</a> and foreign policy theorist <a href="Alfred%20Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a>, and though he preferred to see his own policies as a synthesis of Italian fascism and German Nazism, by the time of the 1936 elections, Quisling had in part become the "Norwegian Hitler" that his opponents had long accused him of being. Part of this was due to his hardening <a href="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> stance, associating Judaism with Marxism, liberalism and, increasingly, anything else he found objectionable, and part as a result of "Nasjonal Samling's" growing similarity to the German Nazi Party. Despite receiving an unexpected boost when the Norwegian government acceded to Soviet demands to arrest Leon Trotsky, the party's election campaign never gained momentum. Although Quisling sincerely believed he had the support of around 100,000 voters, and declared to his party that they would win an absolute minimum of ten seats, "Nasjonal Samling" managed to poll just 26,577, fewer than in 1933 when they had fielded candidates in only half the districts. Under this pressure, the party split in two, with Hjort leading the breakaway group; although fewer than fifty members left immediately, many more drifted away during 1937.

Dwindling party membership created many problems for Quisling, especially financial ones. For years he had been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one <a href="Frans%20Hals">Frans Hals</a> painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned <a href="Constitution%20of%20Norway">constitutional reform</a> of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.

In 1939 Quisling turned his attention towards Norway's preparations for the anticipated European war, which he believed involved a drastic increase in the country's defence spending to guarantee its neutrality. Meanwhile, Quisling presented lectures entitled "The Jewish problem in Norway" and supported <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in what appeared to be growing future conflict. Despite condemning "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>," he sent the German leader a fiftieth-birthday greeting thanking him for "saving Europe from Bolshevism and Jewish domination". In 1939, Quisling contended that, should an Anglo-Russian alliance make neutrality impossible, Norway would have "to go with Germany." Invited to the country in the summer of 1939, he began a tour of a number of German and Danish cities. He was received particularly well in Germany, which promised funds to boost "Nasjonal Samling's" standing in Norway, and hence spread pro-Nazi sentiment. When war broke out on 1 September 1939, Quisling felt vindicated by both the event and the immediate superiority displayed by the German army. He remained outwardly confident that, despite its size, his party would soon become the centre of political attention.

For the next nine months, Quisling continued to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics. He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought to go on the offensive against its then-ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans. After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway, that would let the Germans use Norway as a naval base. Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control. It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, <a href="Albert%20Viljam%20Hagelin">Albert Hagelin</a>, who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times. Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as to whether they had agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.

On 14 December 1939, Quisling met Hitler. The German leader promised to respond to any British invasion of Norway (<a href="Plan%20R%204">Plan R 4</a>), perhaps pre-emptively, with a German counter-invasion, but found Quisling's plans for both a Norwegian coup and an Anglo-German peace unduly optimistic. Nonetheless, Quisling would still receive funds to bolster "Nasjonal Samling." The two men met again four days later, and afterwards Quisling wrote a memorandum that explicitly told Hitler that he did not consider himself a National Socialist. As German machinations continued, Quisling was intentionally kept in the dark. He was also incapacitated by a severe bout of illness, probably <a href="nephritis">nephritis</a> in both kidneys, for which he refused hospitalisation. Though he returned to work on 13 March 1940, he remained ill for several weeks. In the meantime, the <a href="Altmark%20Incident">Altmark Incident</a> complicated Norway's efforts to maintain its neutrality. Hitler himself remained in two minds over whether an occupation of Norway should require an invitation from the Norwegian government. Finally, Quisling received his summons on 31 March, and reluctantly travelled to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> to meet with Nazi intelligence officers who asked him for information on Norwegian defences and defence protocols. He returned to Norway on 6 April and, on 8 April, the British <a href="Operation%20Wilfred">Operation Wilfred</a> commenced, bringing Norway into the war. With <a href="Allied%20campaign%20in%20Norway">Allied forces in Norway</a>, Quisling expected a characteristically swift German response.

In the early hours of 9 April 1940, <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Germany invaded Norway</a> by air and sea, as "Operation "Weserübung,"" or "Operation Weser Exercise," intending to capture King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> and the government of Prime Minister <a href="Johan%20Nygaardsvold">Johan Nygaardsvold</a>. However, alert to the possibility of invasion, <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28Norway%29">Conservative</a> <a href="President%20of%20the%20Storting">President of the Parliament</a> <a href="C.%20J.%20Hambro">C. J. Hambro</a> arranged for their evacuation to <a href="Hamar">Hamar</a> in the east of the country. The "<a href="German%20cruiser%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Blücher</a>," a German cruiser which carried most of the personnel intended to take over Norway's administration, was sunk by cannon fire and torpedoes from <a href="Oscarsborg%20Fortress">Oscarsborg Fortress</a> in the <a href="Oslofjord">Oslofjord</a>. The Germans had expected the government to surrender and to have its replacement ready; neither happened, although the invasion itself continued. After hours of discussion, Quisling and his German counterparts decided that an immediate coup was necessary, though this was not the preferred option of either Germany's ambassador <a href="Curt%20Br%C3%A4uer">Curt Bräuer</a> or the German Foreign Ministry.

In the afternoon, Quisling was told by German liaison <a href="Hans-Wilhelm%20Scheidt">Hans-Wilhelm Scheidt</a> that should he set up a government, it would have Hitler's personal approval. Quisling drew up a list of ministers and, although it had merely relocated some to <a href="Elverum">Elverum</a>, accused the legitimate government of having "fled."

Meanwhile, the Germans occupied Oslo and at 17:30 <a href="NRK">Norwegian radio</a> ceased broadcasting at the request of the occupying forces. With German support, at approximately 19:30, Quisling entered the NRK studios in Oslo and proclaimed the formation of a new government with himself as Prime Minister. He also revoked an earlier order to mobilise against the German invasion. He still lacked legitimacy. Two orders—the first, to a friend in the military (Colonel Hans Sommerfeldt Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum) to arrest the government, and the second, to the <a href="Kristian%20Welhaven">Oslo chief of police</a>—were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours. Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the <a href="Bol%C3%A6rne">Bolærne</a> fortress. As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a> had been part of the German plan all along.

Quisling now reached the high-water mark of his political power. On 10 April, Bräuer travelled to Elverum where the legitimate <a href="Nygaardsvold%27s%20Cabinet">Nygaardsvold government</a> now sat. On Hitler's orders, he demanded that King Haakon appoint Quisling head of a new government, thereby securing a peaceful transition of power. Haakon rejected this demand. He went further in a meeting with his cabinet, letting it be known that he would sooner abdicate than appoint any government headed by Quisling. Hearing this, the government unanimously voted to support the king's stance, and urged the people to continue their resistance. With his popular support gone, Quisling ceased to be of use to Hitler. Germany retracted its support for his rival government, preferring instead to build up its own independent governing commission. In this way, Quisling was manoeuvred out of power by Bräuer and a coalition of his former allies, including Hjort, who now saw him as a liability. Even his political allies, including Prytz, deserted him.

In return, Hitler wrote to Quisling thanking him for his efforts and guaranteeing him some sort of position in the new government. The transfer of power on these terms was duly enacted on 15 April, with Hitler still confident the <a href="Administrative%20Council%20%28Norway%29">Administrative Council</a> would receive the backing of the king. Quisling's domestic and international reputation both hit new lows, casting him as both a traitor and a failure.

Once the king had declared the German commission unlawful, it became clear that he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, <a href="Josef%20Terboven">Josef Terboven</a>, as the new Norwegian "<a href="Reichskommissar">Reichskommissar</a>," or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted to make sure that there would be no room in the government for the "Nasjonal Samling" nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along. Terboven eventually accepted a certain "Nasjonal Samling" presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the "Nasjonal Samling" and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany. Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>, whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned "in triumph," having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The "Reichskommissar" would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the "Nasjonal Samling" and bring more of his men into the cabinet. Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the "Nasjonal Samling" would be the only political party allowed.
As a result, by the end of 1940 the monarchy had been suspended although the Parliament of Norway and a body resembling a cabinet remained. The "Nasjonal Samling," the only pro-German party, would be cultivated, but Terboven's "Reichskommissariat" would keep power in the meantime. Quisling would serve as acting prime minister and ten of the thirteen "cabinet" ministers were to come from his party. He set out on a programme of wiping out "the destructive principles of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>," including <a href="Pluralism%20%28political%20philosophy%29">pluralism</a> and parliamentary rule. This reached into local politics, whereby mayors who switched their allegiance to the "Nasjonal Samling" were rewarded with much greater powers. Investments were made in heavily censored cultural programmes, though the press remained theoretically free. To bolster the survival chances of the Nordic <a href="genotype">genotype</a>, <a href="contraception">contraception</a> was severely restricted. Quisling's party experienced a surge in membership to a little over 30,000, but despite his optimism it was never to pass the 40,000 mark.

On 5 December 1940, Quisling flew to Berlin to negotiate the future of Norway's independence. By the time he returned on 13 December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German "<a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>" (SS). In January, SS head <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, there would be no reason for Germany to annex it. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway. In the process, he also toughened his attitude to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but warned against <a href="Final%20Solution">extermination</a>.

In May, Quisling was shattered by the death of his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the "Nasjonal Samling."

Meanwhile, the government line hardened, with Communist Party leaders arrested and trade unionists intimidated. On 10 September 1941, <a href="Viggo%20Hansteen">Viggo Hansteen</a> and <a href="Rolf%20Wickstr%C3%B8m">Rolf Wickstrøm</a> were executed and many more imprisoned following the <a href="milk%20strike">milk strike</a> in Oslo. Hansteen's execution was later seen as a watershed moment, dividing the occupation into its more innocent and more deadly phases. The same year the "<a href="Statspolitiet">Statspolitiet</a>" ("State Police"), abolished in 1937, was reestablished to assist the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> in Norway, and radio sets were confiscated across the country. Though these were all Terboven's decisions, Quisling agreed with them and went on to denounce the government-in-exile as "traitors." As a result of the toughened stance, an informal "ice front" emerged, with "Nasjonal Samling" supporters ostracised from society. Quisling remained convinced this was an anti-German sentiment that would fade away once Berlin had handed power over to the "Nasjonal Samling." However, the only concessions he won in 1941 were having the heads of ministries promoted to official ministers of the government and independence for the party secretariat.

In January 1942, Terboven announced the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved the transfer of power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway were in the midst of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>, while Terboven insisted that the "Reichskommissariat" would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.

After a brief postponement, an announcement was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of <a href="Minister-President">Minister-President</a> of the national government. The appointment was accompanied by a banquet, rallying and other celebrations by the "Nasjonal Samling" members. In his first speech, Quisling committed the government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Norway">ban on Jewish entry into Norway</a>, which had been <a href="Norwegian%20Constitution%23Development">abolished in 1851</a>.

His new position gave Quisling a security of tenure he had not previously enjoyed, although the "Reichskommissariat" remained outside his control. A month later, in February 1942, Quisling made his first state visit to Berlin. It was a productive trip, in which all key issues of Norwegian independence were discussed—but <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> in particular remained unconvinced of Quisling's credentials, noting that it was "unlikely" he would "... ever make a great statesman."

Back at home, Quisling was now less concerned about "Nasjonal Samling's" membership and even wanted action to clean up the membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.

This optimism was short-lived. In the course of the summer of 1942, Quisling lost any ability he might have had to sway public opinion by attempting to force children into the "Nasjonal Samlings Ungdomsfylking" youth organisation, which was modelled on the <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. This move prompted a mass resignation of teachers from their professional body and churchmen from their posts, along with large-scale civil unrest. His attempted indictment of Bishop <a href="Eivind%20Berggrav">Eivind Berggrav</a> proved similarly controversial, even amongst his German allies. Quisling now toughened his stance, telling Norwegians that they would have the new regime forced upon them "whether they like it or not." On 1 May, the German High Command noted that "organised resistance to Quisling has started" and Norway's peace talks with Germany stalled as a result. On 11 August, Hitler postponed any further peace negotiations until the war ended. Quisling was admonished and learned that Norway would not get the independence he so greatly yearned for. As an added insult, for the first time he was forbidden to write letters directly to Hitler.

Quisling had earlier pushed for a corporate alternative to the Parliament of Norway, the "Storting," which he called a "Riksting." It would comprise two chambers, the "Næringsting" (Economic Chamber) and "Kulturting" (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of "Nasjonal Samling's" eighth and last national convention on 25 September and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The "Riksting" became an advisory body while the "Førerting," or "Fører" Council, and parliamentary chambers were now to be independent bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.

After the convention, support for "Nasjonal Samling," and Quisling personally, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician <a href="Gulbrand%20Lunde">Gulbrand Lunde</a>, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, such as the shooting of ten well-known residents of <a href="Tr%C3%B8ndelag">Trøndelag</a> and its environs in <a href="Martial%20law%20in%20Trondheim%20in%201942">October 1942</a>. In addition, the "<a href="lex%20Eilifsen">lex Eilifsen</a>" "ex-post facto" law of August 1943, which led to the first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a>, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.
With government abatement and Quisling's personal engagement, Jews were registered in a German initiative of January 1942. On 26 October, German forces, with help from the Norwegian police, arrested 300 registered male Jews in Norway and sent them to <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s, most in <a href="Berg%2C%20Norway">Berg</a> and manned by "<a href="Hirden">Hirden</a>," the paramilitary wing of "Nasjonal Samling." Most controversially, the Jews' property was confiscated by the state.

On 26 November, the detainees were deported, along with their families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware of it, although government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public to believe that the first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a <a href="Madagascar%20Plan">new Jewish homeland</a>.

At the same time, Quisling believed that the only way he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage <a href="total%20war">total war</a>. For him at least, after the German defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.
Quisling tired during the final years of the war. In 1942 he passed 231 laws, 166 in 1943, and 139 in 1944. Social policy was the one area that still received significant attention. By that autumn, Quisling and <a href="Anton%20Mussert">Mussert</a> in the Netherlands could be satisfied they had at least survived. In 1944, the weight problems Quisling had been having during the preceding two years also eased.

Despite the increasingly dire military outlook, "Nasjonal Samling's" position at the head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the "Reichskommissariat," remained unassailable. Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following the deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">University of Oslo</a>. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of the arrests. Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when he forced compulsory military service on elements of the "Hirden," causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.

On 20 January 1945, Quisling made what would be his final trip to visit Hitler. He promised Norwegian support in the final phase of the war if Germany agreed to a peace deal that would remove Norway's affairs from German intervention. This proposal grew out of a fear that as German forces retreated southwards through Norway, the occupation government would have to struggle to keep control in northern Norway. To the horror of the Quisling regime, the Nazis instead decided on a <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policy in northern Norway, going so far as to shoot Norwegian civilians who refused to evacuate the region. The period was also marked by increasing civilian casualties from <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> air raids, and mounting <a href="Norwegian%20resistance%20movement">resistance to the government</a> within occupied Norway. The meeting with the German leader proved unsuccessful and upon being asked to sign the execution order of thousands of Norwegian "saboteurs," Quisling refused, an act of defiance that so enraged Terboven, acting on Hitler's orders, that he stormed out of the negotiations. On recounting the events of the trip to a friend, Quisling broke down in tears, convinced the Nazi refusal to sign a peace agreement would seal his reputation as a traitor.

Quisling spent the last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the showdown that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>s. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a naïve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.

On 7 May, Quisling ordered police not to offer armed resistance to the Allied advance except in self-defence or against overt members of the Norwegian resistance movement. The same day, Germany announced it would surrender unconditionally, making Quisling's position untenable. A realist, Quisling met military leaders of the resistance on the following day to discuss how he would be arrested. Quisling declared whilst he did not want to be treated as a common criminal, he did not want preferential treatment compared to his "Nasjonal Samling" colleagues. He argued he could have kept his forces fighting until the end, but had chosen not to so as to avoid turning "Norway into a battlefield." Instead, he tried to ensure a peaceful transition. In return, the resistance offered full trials for all accused "Nasjonal Samling" members after the war, and its leadership agreed he could be incarcerated in a house rather than a prison complex.

The civil leadership of the resistance, represented by lawyer <a href="Sven%20Arntzen">Sven Arntzen</a>, demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police. Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in <a href="M%C3%B8llergata%2019">Møllergata 19</a>, the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and a hole in the wall for a toilet bucket.

After ten weeks being constantly watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he was transferred to <a href="Akershus%20Fortress">Akershus Fortress</a> and awaited trial as part of the <a href="Legal%20purge%20in%20Norway%20after%20World%20War%20II">legal purge</a>. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from <a href="polyneuritis">polyneuritis</a>, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with <a href="Henrik%20Bergh">Henrik Bergh</a>, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act in the best interests of Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.

Initially, Quisling's charges related to the coup, including his revocation of the mobilisation order, to his time as "Nasjonal Samling" leader and to his actions as Minister President, such as assisting the enemy and illegally attempting to alter the constitution. Finally, he was accused of <a href="Gunnar%20Eilifsen">Gunnar Eilifsen</a>'s murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.

The trial opened on 20 August 1945. Quisling's defence rested on downplaying his unity with Germany and stressing that he had fought for total independence, something that seemed completely contrary to the recollections of many Norwegians. From that point on, wrote biographer Dahl, Quisling had to tread a "fine line between truth and falsehood," and emerged from it "an elusive and often pitiful figure." He misrepresented the truth on several occasions and the truthful majority of his statements won him few advocates in the country at large, where he remained almost universally despised.

In the later days of the trial, Quisling's health suffered, largely as a result of the number of medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's powerful final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor <a href="Ann%C3%A6us%20Schj%C3%B8dt">Annæus Schjødt</a> called for the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a>, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.
Erudite speeches by both Bergh and Quisling himself could not change the outcome. When the verdict was announced on 10 September, Quisling was convicted on all but a handful of minor charges and sentenced to death.

An October appeal to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Norway">Supreme Court</a> was rejected. The court process was judged to be "a model of fairness" in a commentary by author Maynard Cohen. After giving testimony in a number of other trials of "Nasjonal Samling" members, Quisling was <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">executed by firing squad</a> at Akershus Fortress at 02:40 on 24 October 1945. His last words before being shot were, "I'm convicted unfairly and I die innocent." After his death his body was cremated, leaving the ashes to be interred in Fyresdal.

His widow Maria lived in Oslo until her death in 1980. They had no children. Upon her death, she donated all their Russian antiques to a charitable fund that still operated in Oslo as of August 2017. For most of his later political career, Quisling lived in a mansion on <a href="Bygd%C3%B8y">Bygdøy</a> in Oslo that he called "<a href="Villa%20Grande">Gimle</a>," after the place in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a> where survivors of the great battle of <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a> were to live. The house, later renamed Villa Grande, in time became a <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> museum. The "Nasjonal Samling" movement was wiped out as a political force in Norway, though Quisling himself has become one of the most written about Norwegians of all time. The word "quisling" itself became synonymous with "<a href="traitor">traitor</a>." The term was coined by the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in its lead of 15 April 1940, titled "Quislings everywhere." The noun survived, and for a while during and after World War II, the <a href="back-formation">back-formed</a> verb "to quisle" was used. One who was "quisling" was in the act of committing treason.

To his supporters, Quisling was regarded as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.

Post-war interpretations of Quisling's character are similarly mixed. After the war collaborationist behaviour was popularly viewed as a result of mental deficiency, leaving the personality of the clearly more intelligent Quisling an "enigma." He was instead seen as weak, paranoid, intellectually sterile and power-hungry: ultimately "muddled rather than thoroughly corrupted."

The Norwegian sociologist <a href="Johan%20Galtung">Johan Galtung</a> described Quisling as a mini-Hitler with a CMT (chosenness-myth-trauma) complex, or alternatively, megalo-paranoia, more often diagnosed in modern times as <a href="narcissistic%20personality%20disorder">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. He was "well installed in his personality," but unable to gain a following among his own people as the population did not provide a mirror for Quisling's ideology. In short, he was "a dictator and a clown on the wrong stage with the wrong script." As quoted by Dahl, psychiatrist Professor <a href="Gabriel%20Langfeldt">Gabriel Langfeldt</a> stated Quisling's ultimate philosophical goals "fitted the classic description of the <a href="paranoia">paranoid</a> <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a>c more exactly than any other case [he had] ever encountered."

During his time in office, Quisling rose early, often having completed several hours of work before arriving at the office between 9:30 and 10:00. He liked to intervene in virtually all government matters, reading all letters addressed to him or his chancellery personally and marking a surprising number for action. Quisling was independently minded, made several key decisions on the spot and, unlike his German counterpart, he liked to follow procedure to ensure that government remained "a dignified and civilised" affair throughout. He took a personal interest in the administration of Fyresdal, where he was born.

He rejected <a href="Master%20race">German racial supremacy</a> and instead saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing his own family tree in his spare time. Party members did not receive preferential treatment, though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships of his fellow Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused and he did not live extravagantly.

Quisling was interested in science, Eastern religions and metaphysics, eventually building up a library that included the works of <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Spinoza</a>, <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>, <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegel</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>. He kept up with developments in the realm of <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>, but did not keep up with more current philosophical ideas. He blended philosophy and science into a new religion he called "Universism," or "Universalism," which was a unified explanation of everything. His original writings stretched to a claimed two thousand pages. He rejected the basic teachings of orthodox Christianity and established a new theory of life, which he called "Universism," a term borrowed from a textbook which <a href="Jan%20Jakob%20Maria%20de%20Groot">Jan Jakob Maria de Groot</a> had written on <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a>. De Groot's book argued that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism were all part of a world religion that De Groot called Universism. Quisling described how his philosophy "... followed from the universal <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">theory of relativity</a>, of which the <a href="Special%20theory%20of%20relativity">specific</a> and <a href="General%20theory%20of%20relativity">general theories of relativity</a> are special instances." Quisling wanted universism to be the official state religion of his new Norway, and he said "the positing of such a system depends on the progress of science."

His "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>" was divided into four parts: an introduction; a description of mankind's apparent progression from individual to increasing complex consciousnesses; a section on his tenets of morality and law; and a final section on science, art, politics, history, race and religion. The conclusion was to be titled "The World's Organic Classification and Organisation," but the work remained unfinished. Generally, Quisling worked on it infrequently during his time in politics. The biographer <a href="Hans%20Fredrik%20Dahl">Hans Fredrik Dahl</a> describes this as "fortunate" since Quisling would "never have won recognition" as a philosopher.

During his trial and particularly after being sentenced, Quisling became interested once more in Universism. He saw the events of the war as part of the move towards the establishment of God's kingdom on earth and justified his actions in those terms. During the first week of October, he wrote a fifty-page document titled "Universistic Aphorisms," which represented "... an almost ecstatic revelation of truth and the light to come, which bore the mark of nothing less than a prophet." The document was also notable for its attack on the <a href="materialism">materialism</a> of National Socialism. In addition, he simultaneously worked on a sermon, "Eternal Justice," which reiterated his key beliefs, including reincarnation.

Velociraptor

Velociraptor (; meaning "swift seizer" in <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a> <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived approximately 75 to 71 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a> during the latter part of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>. Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> is "V. mongoliensis"; <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of this species have been discovered in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. A second species, "V. osmolskae", was named in 2008 for skull material from <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>, <a href="China">China</a>.

Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>" and "<a href="Achillobator">Achillobator</a>", "Velociraptor" nevertheless shared many of the same <a href="anatomy">anatomical</a> features. It was a <a href="biped">biped</a>al, <a href="feather">feather</a>ed <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a> with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped <a href="claw">claw</a> on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel <a href="predation">prey</a>. "Velociraptor" can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low <a href="skull">skull</a>, with an upturned snout.

"Velociraptor" (commonly shortened to "raptor") is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the "<a href="Jurassic%20Park">Jurassic Park</a>" motion picture series. In real life, however, "Velociraptor" was roughly the size of a <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a>, considerably smaller than the approximately tall and reptiles seen in the films (which were based on members of the related genus "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>"). Today, "Velociraptor" is well known to <a href="paleontology">paleontologists</a>, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons, the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a "Velociraptor" locked in combat with a "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>".

"Velociraptor" was a mid-sized <a href="dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a>, with adults measuring up to long, high at the hip, and weighing up to , though there is a higher estimate of . The skull, which grew up to long, was uniquely up-curved, concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower. The jaws were lined with 26–28 widely spaced teeth on each side, each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front.

"Velociraptor", like other dromaeosaurids, had a large <a href="Manus%20%28zoology%29">manus</a> ('hand') with three strongly curved claws, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s. The second digit was the longest of the three digits present, while the first was shortest. The structure of the <a href="carpal">carpal</a> (wrist) bones prevented <a href="pronation">pronation</a> of the wrist and forced the 'hands' to be held with the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">palmar</a> surface facing inwards (<a href="Lateral%20and%20medial">medially</a>), not downwards. The first digit of the foot, as in other theropods, was a small <a href="dewclaw">dewclaw</a>. However, whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground, dromaeosaurids like "Velociraptor" walked on only their third and fourth digits. The second digit, for which "Velociraptor" is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off the ground. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a> dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, which could grow to over long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device used to tear into or restrain struggling prey.
As in other dromaeosaurs, "Velociraptor" tails had long bony projections (<a href="prezygapophysis">prezygapophyses</a>) on the upper surfaces of the <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e, as well as <a href="ossification">ossified</a> <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an "S"-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.

In 2007, paleontologists reported the discovery of quill knobs on a well-preserved "Velociraptor mongoliensis" forearm from Mongolia, confirming the presence of <a href="feather">feather</a>s in this species.

Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than "Velociraptor" are known to have had <a href="feather">feather</a>s covering their bodies and fully developed feathered wings. The fact that the ancestors of "Velociraptor" were feathered and possibly capable of flight had long suggested to paleontologists that "Velociraptor" bore feathers as well, since even <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a>s today retain most of their feathers. In September 2007, researchers found <a href="feathers">quill knobs</a> on the forearm of a "Velociraptor" found in Mongolia. These bumps on bird wing bones show where feathers anchor, and their presence on "Velociraptor" indicate it too had feathers. According to paleontologist Alan Turner,

Co-author Mark Norell, Curator-in-Charge of fossil reptiles, amphibians and birds at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, also weighed in on the discovery, saying:

According to Turner and co-authors Norell and Peter Makovicky, quill knobs are not found in all prehistoric birds, and their absence does not mean that an animal was not feathered – <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>s, for example, have no quill knobs. However, their presence confirms that "Velociraptor" bore modern-style wing feathers, with a rachis and vane formed by barbs. The forearm specimen on which the quill knobs were found (specimen number IGM 100/981) represents an animal in length and in weight. Based on the spacing of the six preserved knobs in this specimen, the authors suggested that "Velociraptor" bore 14 secondaries (wing feathers stemming from the forearm), compared with 12 or more in "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>", 18 in "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>", and 10 in "<a href="Rahonavis">Rahonavis</a>". This type of variation in the number of wing feathers between closely related species, the authors asserted, is to be expected, given similar variation among modern birds.

Turner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on "Velociraptor" as evidence against the idea that the larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size. Furthermore, they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today, and that their presence in "Velociraptor" (presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making "Velociraptor" and other large members of this family secondarily flightless, though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of "Velociraptor" had a purpose other than flight. The feathers of the flightless "Velociraptor" may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding, or for added speed and thrust when running up inclined slopes.

During an <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> expedition to the Outer Mongolian <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a>, on 11 August 1923 <a href="Peter%20Kaisen">Peter Kaisen</a> recovered the first "Velociraptor" fossil known to science: a crushed but complete skull, associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws (<a href="AMNH">AMNH</a> 6515). In 1924, museum president <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> designated the skull and claw (which he assumed to come from the hand) as the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of his new genus, "Velociraptor". This name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "velox" ('swift') and "raptor" ('robber' or 'plunderer') and refers to the animal's <a href="cursorial">cursorial</a> nature and carnivorous diet. Osborn named the type species "V. mongoliensis" after its country of origin. Earlier that year, Osborn had mentioned the animal in a popular press article, under the name "Ovoraptor djadochtari" (not to be confused with the similarly named "<a href="Oviraptor">Oviraptor</a>"). However, because the name "Ovoraptor" was not published in a scientific journal or accompanied by a formal description, it is considered a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" ('naked name'), and the name "Velociraptor" retains priority.

While North American teams were shut out of <a href="Mongolian%20People%27s%20Republic">communist Mongolia</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, expeditions by <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> and <a href="Poland">Polish</a> scientists, in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues, recovered several more specimens of "Velociraptor". The most famous is part of the famous "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen (<a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">GIN</a> 100/25), discovered by a Polish-Mongolian team in 1971. This fossil preserves a single "Velociraptor" in the midst of battle against a lone "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>". This specimen is considered a national treasure of Mongolia, although in 2000 it was loaned to the American Museum of Natural History in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> for a temporary exhibition.
Between 1988 and 1990, a joint <a href="China">Chinese</a>-<a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> team discovered "Velociraptor" remains in northern China. American scientists returned to Mongolia in 1990, and a joint Mongolian-American expedition to the Gobi, led by the American Museum of Natural History and the <a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Mongolian Academy of Sciences</a>, turned up several well-preserved skeletons. One such specimen, IGM 100/980, was nicknamed "Ichabodcraniosaurus" by Norell's team because the fairly complete specimen was found without its skull (an allusion to the <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a> character <a href="Ichabod%20Crane">Ichabod Crane</a>). This specimen may belong to "Velociraptor mongoliensis", but Norell and Makovicky concluded that it was not complete enough to say for sure, and it awaits a formal description.

<a href="Maxilla">Maxilla</a>e and a <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal</a> (the main tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw, and the bone that forms the anterior margin of the eye socket, respectively) recovered in 1999 by the Sino-Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to "Velociraptor", but not to the type species "V. mongoliensis". <a href="Pascal%20Godefroit">Pascal Godefroit</a> and colleagues named these bones "V. osmolskae" (for Polish paleontologist <a href="Halszka%20Osm%C3%B3lska">Halszka Osmólska</a>) in 2008.

"Velociraptor" is a member of the group <a href="Eudromaeosauria">Eudromaeosauria</a>, a <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> sub-group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. It is often placed within its own "subfamily", <a href="Velociraptorinae">Velociraptorinae</a>. In <a href="phylogenetic%20taxonomy">phylogenetic taxonomy</a>, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as "all dromaeosaurs more closely related to "Velociraptor" than to "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus</a>"." However, dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain "Velociraptor". Other analyses have often included other genera, usually "Deinonychus" and "<a href="Saurornitholestes">Saurornitholestes</a>", and more recently "Tsaagan". However, several studies published during the 2010s, including expanded versions of the analyses that found support for Velociraptorinae, have failed to resolve it as a distinct group, but rather have suggested it is a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> grade which gave rise to the <a href="Dromaeosaurinae">Dromaeosaurinae</a>.

In the past, other dromaeosaurid species, including "Deinonychus antirrhopus" and "Saurornitholestes langstoni", have sometimes been classified in the genus "Velociraptor". Since "Velociraptor" was the first to be named, these species were renamed "Velociraptor antirrhopus" and "V. langstoni". However, the only currently recognized species of "Velociraptor" are "V. mongoliensis" and "V. osmolskae".

When first described in 1924, "Velociraptor" was placed in the family <a href="Megalosauridae">Megalosauridae</a>, as was the case with most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>", functioned as a sort of 'wastebin' taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, "Velociraptor" was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family <a href="Archaeopterygidae">Archaeopterygidae</a> by at least one author (which would, in effect, make "Velociraptor" a flightless bird).

The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group.

The "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, found in 1971, preserves a "Velociraptor mongoliensis" and "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops andrewsi</a>" in combat and provides direct evidence of predatory behavior. When originally reported, it was hypothesized that the two animals drowned. However, as the animals were preserved in ancient sand dune deposits, it is now thought that the animals were buried in sand, either from a collapsing dune or in a <a href="Dust%20storm">sandstorm</a>. Burial must have been extremely fast, judging from the lifelike poses in which the animals were preserved. Parts of the "Protoceratops" are missing, which has been seen as evidence of <a href="scavenger">scavenging</a> by other animals. Comparisons between the <a href="sclerotic%20ring">scleral rings</a> of "Velociraptor", "Protoceratops", and modern birds and reptiles indicates that "Velociraptor" may have been <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, while "Protoceratops" may have been <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>, active throughout the day during short intervals, suggesting that the fight may have occurred at twilight or during low-light conditions.

The distinctive claw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and <a href="disembowel">disembowel</a> prey. In the "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, the "Velociraptor" lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of "Protoceratops" is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests "Velociraptor" may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat, such as the <a href="jugular%20vein">jugular vein</a>, <a href="carotid%20artery">carotid artery</a>, or <a href="vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a> (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is preserved. The thick abdominal wall of <a href="skin">skin</a> and <a href="muscle">muscle</a> of large prey species would have been difficult to slash without a specialized cutting surface. The slashing <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> was tested during a 2005 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary, "<a href="The%20Truth%20About%20Killer%20Dinosaurs">The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs</a>". The producers of the program created an artificial "Velociraptor" leg with a sickle claw and used a <a href="pork%20belly">pork belly</a> to simulate the dinosaur's prey. Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall, it was unable to tear it open, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey.

Remains of "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>", a closely related dromaeosaurid, have commonly been found in aggregations of several individuals. "Deinonychus" has also been found in association with a large herbivore, "<a href="Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a>", which has been seen as evidence of cooperative hunting. The only solid evidence for social behavior among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group, though no evidence of cooperative hunting was found. Although many isolated fossils of "Velociraptor" have been found in Mongolia, none were closely associated with any other individuals. Therefore, while "Velociraptor" is commonly depicted as a <a href="pack%20hunter">pack hunter</a>, as in "Jurassic Park", there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general, and none specific to "Velociraptor" itself. The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>" found around the remains of a "<a href="Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a>". No other group of dromaeosaurids has been found in close association.

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurs like "Velociraptor" and similar dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey. This model, known as the "raptor prey restraint" (RPR) model of predation, proposes that dromaeosaurs killed their prey in a manner very similar to extant <a href="Accipitridae">accipitrid</a> <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>: by leaping onto their quarry, pinning it under their body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. These researchers proposed that, like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while it was still alive and prey death eventually came from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s and <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. The short <a href="Tarsometatarsus">metatarsus</a> and foot strength, however, would have been more similar to that of <a href="owl">owl</a>s. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of "Velociraptor"s anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms, which could exert a lot of force but were likely covered in long feathers, may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. The jaws, thought by Fowler and colleagues to be comparatively weak, would have been useful for row saw motion bites like the modern day <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>, which also has a weak bite, to finish off its prey if the kicks weren't powerful enough. These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the <a href="Origin%20of%20avian%20flight">origin of flapping</a> in <a href="paravian">paravian</a>s.

In 2010, Hone and colleagues published a paper on their 2008 discovery of shed teeth of what they believed to be a "Velociraptor" near a tooth-marked jaw bone of what they believed to be a "Protoceratops" in the Bayan Mandahu Formation. The authors concluded that the find represented "late-stage carcass consumption by "Velociraptor"" as the predator would have eaten other parts of a freshly killed "Protoceratops" before biting in the jaw area. The evidence was seen as supporting the inference from the "Fighting Dinosaurs" fossil that "Protoceratops" was part of the diet of "Velociraptor". In 2012, Hone and colleagues published a paper that described a "Velociraptor" specimen with a long bone of an <a href="azhdarchid">azhdarchid</a> <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> in its gut. This was interpreted as showing scavenging behaviour.

"Velociraptor" was <a href="warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a> to some degree, as it required a significant amount of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like "Velociraptor" did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a> is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.

One "Velociraptor mongoliensis" skull bears two parallel rows of small punctures that match the spacing and size of "Velociraptor" teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another "Velociraptor" during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone shows no sign of healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an <a href="Azhdarchidae">azhdarchid</a> pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the "Velociraptor" died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.

All known specimens of "Velociraptor mongoliensis" were discovered in the <a href="Djadochta%20Formation">Djadochta Formation</a> (also spelled Djadokhta), in the Mongolian province of <a href="%C3%96mn%C3%B6govi%20Province">Ömnögovi</a>. Species of "Velociraptor" have also been reported from the slightly younger <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot Formation</a> of Mongolia, though these are indeterminate and may belong to a related genus instead. These <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a>s are estimated to date back to the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> <a href="faunal%20stage">stage</a> (between 83 and 70 million years ago) of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Epoch%20%28geology%29">Epoch</a>.

"V. mongoliensis" has been found at many of the most famous and prolific Djadochta localities. The type specimen was discovered at the <a href="Flaming%20Cliffs">Flaming Cliffs</a> site (also known as Bayn Dzak and Shabarakh Usu), while the "Fighting Dinosaurs" were found at the Tugrig locality (also known as Tugrugeen Shireh). The well-known Barun Goyot localities of Khulsan and Khermeen Tsav have also produced remains which may belong to "Velociraptor" or a related genus. Teeth and partial remains attributed to juvenile "V. mongoliensis" have also been reported from the <a href="Bayan%20Mandahu%20Formation">Bayan Mandahu Formation</a>, a prolific site in Inner Mongolia, China that is contemporaneous with the Djadochta Formation. However, these fossils had not been prepared or studied as of 2008. A partial adult skull from the Bayan Mandahu Formation has been assigned to a distinct species, "Velociraptor osmolskae".

All of the fossil sites that have yielded "Velociraptor" remains preserve an arid environment with fields of sand <a href="dune">dune</a>s and only intermittent <a href="stream">stream</a>s, although the younger Barun Goyot environment seems to have been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. The posture of some complete fossils, as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during <a href="Dust%20storm">sandstorm</a> events common to the three environments.

Many of the same genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was inhabited by "Velociraptor mongoliensis", "<a href="Protoceratops%20andrewsi">Protoceratops andrewsi</a>", and "<a href="Pinacosaurus%20grangeri">Pinacosaurus grangeri</a>", while the Bayan Mandahu was home to "Velociraptor osmolskae", "<a href="Protoceratops%20hellenikorhinus">Protoceratops hellenikorhinus</a>", and "<a href="Pinacosaurus%20mephistocephalus">Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus</a>". These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively close to each other geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, it is more likely that those differences indicate a slight time difference.

Other dinosaurs known from the same locality as "V. mongoliensis" include the <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a> "<a href="Saurornithoides%20mongoliensis">Saurornithoides mongoliensis</a>", the <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a> "<a href="Oviraptor%20philoceratops">Oviraptor philoceratops</a>", and the dromaeosaurid "<a href="Mahakala%20omnogovae">Mahakala omnogovae</a>". "V. osmolskae" lived alongside the <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>n species "<a href="Magnirostris%20dodsoni">Magnirostris dodsoni</a>", as well as the <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a> "<a href="Machairasaurus%20leptonychus">Machairasaurus leptonychus</a>" and the <a href="dromaeosaurid">dromaeosaurid</a> "<a href="Linheraptor%20exquisitus">Linheraptor exquisitus</a>".

"Velociraptor" are well known for their role as vicious and cunning killers thanks to their portrayal in the 1990 novel "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28novel%29">Jurassic Park</a>" by <a href="Michael%20Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> and its 1993 <a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a>, directed by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. The "raptors" portrayed in "Jurassic Park" were actually modeled after the closely related <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a> "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>". Paleontologists in both the novel and film excavate a skeleton in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, far from the central Asian range of "Velociraptor" but characteristic of the "Deinonychus" range. A character in Crichton's novel also states that ""Deinonychus" is now considered one of the velociraptors", which suggests that Crichton used the controversial <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> proposed by <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a>, even though the "raptors" in the novel are at another point referred to as "V. mongoliensis". Crichton met with the discoverer of "Deinonychus", <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a>, several times at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> to discuss details of the animal's possible range of behaviors and appearance. Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name "Velociraptor" in place of "Deinonychus" because the former name was "more dramatic". According to Ostrom, Crichton stated that the "Velociraptor" of the novel was based on "Deinonychus" in almost every detail, and that only the name had been changed. The "Jurassic Park" filmmakers also requested all of Ostrom's published papers on "Deinonychus" during production. They portrayed the animals with the size, proportions, and snout shape of "Deinonychus" rather than "Velociraptor".

Production on "Jurassic Park" began before the discovery of the large dromaeosaurid "<a href="Utahraptor">Utahraptor</a>" was made public in 1991, but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery: "Later, after we had designed and built the Raptor, there was a discovery of a Raptor skeleton in Utah, which they labeled 'super-slasher'. They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date - and it measured five-and-a-half-feet tall, just like ours. So we designed it, we built it, and then they discovered it. That still boggles my mind." Spielberg was particularly pleased with the discovery of the "Utahraptor" because of the boost it gave to the velociraptors in his film. Spielberg's name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur. In reality, "Velociraptor", like many other <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n theropods, was covered in feathers.

Vincent van Gogh

Vincent Willem van Gogh (; 30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch <a href="Post-Impressionism">Post-Impressionist</a> painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of <a href="Western%20art">Western art</a>. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>s, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include <a href="Trees%20and%20Undergrowth%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">landscapes</a>, <a href="Still%20life%20paintings%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%28Paris%29">still lifes</a>, <a href="Portraits%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh">portraits</a> and <a href="Portraits%20of%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh">self-portraits</a>, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive <a href="paintwork">brushwork</a> that contributed to the foundations of <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a>. However, he was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.

Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother <a href="Theo%20van%20Gogh%20%28art%20dealer%29">Theo</a> supported him financially, and the two kept up a <a href="The%20Letters%20of%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh">long correspondence by letter</a>. His early works, mostly <a href="Still%20life%20paintings%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%28Netherlands%29">still lifes</a> and depictions of <a href="Peasant%20Character%20Studies%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">peasant labourers</a>, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>", including <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bernard%20%28painter%29">Émile Bernard</a> and <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>, who were reacting against the <a href="Impressionist">Impressionist</a> sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and <a href="Montmartre%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">local landscapes</a>. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in <a href="Arles">Arles</a> in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of <a href="Olive%20Trees%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">olive trees</a>, <a href="Wheat%20Fields%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">wheat fields</a> and <a href="Sunflowers%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">sunflowers</a>.

Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at <a href="Saint-R%C3%A9my-de-Provence">Saint-Rémy</a>. After he discharged himself and moved to the <a href="Auberge%20Ravoux">Auberge Ravoux</a> in <a href="Auvers-sur-Oise">Auvers-sur-Oise</a> near Paris, he came under the care of the <a href="homeopathy">homeopathic</a> doctor <a href="Paul%20Gachet">Paul Gachet</a>. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.

Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist "where discourses on madness and creativity converge". His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the <a href="Fauvism">Fauves</a> and <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionists</a>. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the <a href="tortured%20artist">tortured artist</a>. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold at auction, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.

The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, <a href="Theo%20van%20Gogh%20%28art%20dealer%29">Theo</a>. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.

Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; Vincent kept few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow <a href="Johanna%20van%20Gogh-Bonger">Johanna</a> arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a "diary-like intimacy", and read in parts like autobiography. The translator <a href="Arnold%20Pomerans">Arnold Pomerans</a> wrote that their publication adds a "fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter".

There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister <a href="Wil%20van%20Gogh">Wil</a>, 58 to the painter <a href="Anthon%20van%20Rappard">Anthon van Rappard</a>, 22 to <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bernard%20%28painter%29">Émile Bernard</a> as well as individual letters to <a href="Paul%20Signac">Paul Signac</a>, <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a> and the critic <a href="Albert%20Aurier">Albert Aurier</a>. Some are illustrated with <a href="sketch%20%28drawing%29">sketches</a>. Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English. There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.

Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 into a <a href="Dutch%20Reformed">Dutch Reformed</a> family in <a href="Zundert">Groot-Zundert</a>, in the predominantly Catholic province of <a href="North%20Brabant">North Brabant</a> in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a> in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).

Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, and his father was the youngest son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and <a href="Wil%20van%20Gogh">Willemina</a> (known as "Wil"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her. Theodorus's salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.
Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860 was sent to the village school. In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at <a href="Zevenbergen">Zevenbergen</a>, where he felt abandoned, and campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in <a href="Tilburg">Tilburg</a>, where he was deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. <a href="Constant%20Cornelis%20Huijsmans">Constant Cornelis Huijsmans</a>, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868 he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was "austere and cold, and sterile".

In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers <a href="Goupil%20%26amp%3B%20Cie">Goupil & Cie</a> in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at <a href="87%20Hackford%20Road%20%28Van%20Gogh%29">87 Hackford Road</a>, <a href="Stockwell">Stockwell</a>. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.
In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>. When the proprietor moved to <a href="Isleworth">Isleworth</a> in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to <a href="Etten-Leur">Etten</a>; in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a>. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.

To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him to live with his uncle <a href="Johannes%20Stricker">Johannes Stricker</a>, a respected theologian, in Amsterdam. Van Gogh prepared for the <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a> theology entrance examination; he failed the exam, and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> missionary school in <a href="Laken">Laken</a>, near Brussels.

In January 1879 he took up a post as a missionary at <a href="Petit%20Wasmes">Petit-Wasmes</a> in the coal-mining district of <a href="Borinage">Borinage</a> in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person, and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw. His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for "undermining the dignity of the priesthood". He then walked the to Brussels, returned briefly to <a href="Cuesmes">Cuesmes</a> in the Borinage, but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration for his parents. His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son should be committed to the lunatic asylum at <a href="Geel">Geel</a>.

Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist <a href="Willem%20Roelofs">Willem Roelofs</a>, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Royale%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts</a>. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of <a href="Shading">modelling</a> and <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>.
Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia "Kee" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She refused with the words "No, nay, never" (""nooit, neen, nimmer""). After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, <a href="Anton%20Mauve">Anton Mauve</a>. Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be. Mauve invited him to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in <a href="charcoal%20%28art%29">charcoal</a> and <a href="pastel">pastel</a>s; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.

Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, one which he described to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his "persistence is "disgusting"". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: "Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame." He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.

Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from <a href="plaster%20cast">plaster cast</a>s. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhoea</a> and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were.
By March 1882, Mauve appears to have gone cold towards Van Gogh, and stopped replying to his letters. He had learned of Van Gogh's new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute, <a href="Sien%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Clasina Maria "Sien" Hoornik</a> (1850–1904), and her young daughter. Van Gogh had met Sien towards the end of January 1882, when she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this; on 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem. When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him, and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883, he left Sien and the children.

Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the <a href="Scheldt">River Scheldt</a> in 1904.

In September 1883, Van Gogh moved to <a href="Drenthe">Drenthe</a> in the northern Netherlands. In December, driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in <a href="Nuenen">Nuenen</a>, North Brabant.

In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and <a href="Peasant%20Character%20Studies%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23The%20weaver">paintings of weavers</a> and <a href="Cottages%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">their cottages</a>. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a>, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.

Van Gogh painted several groups of <a href="Still%20life%20paintings%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%28Netherlands%29">still lifes</a> in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work.

There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885. Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit. In May, Van Gogh responded with his first major work, "<a href="The%20Potato%20Eaters">The Potato Eaters</a>", and a series of "<a href="Peasant%20Character%20Studies%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">peasant character studies</a>" which were the culmination of several years of work. When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark, and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism. In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague. One of his <a href="Peasant%20Character%20Studies%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23Woman">young peasant sitters</a> became pregnant in September 1885; Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.

He moved to Antwerp that November, and rented a room above a paint dealer's shop in the rue des Images ("Lange Beeldekensstraat"). He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and <a href="tobacco%20smoking">tobacco</a> became his staple diet. In February 1886 he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful. In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of <a href="colour%20theory">colour theory</a> and spent time in museumsparticularly studying the work of <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>and broadened his palette to include <a href="carmine">carmine</a>, <a href="cobalt%20blue">cobalt blue</a> and <a href="Paris%20green">emerald green</a>. Van Gogh bought Japanese <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings. He was drinking heavily again, and was hospitalised between February and March 1886, when he was possibly also treated for <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>.

After his recovery, and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20%28Antwerp%29">Academy of Fine Arts</a> in Antwerp, and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking. He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with <a href="Charles%20Verlat">Charles Verlat</a>, the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class <a href="Franz%20Vinck">Franz Vinck</a>. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Siberdt">Eugène Siberdt</a>. Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When Van Gogh was required to draw the <a href="Venus%20of%20Milo">Venus of Milo</a> during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh's drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, "God damn it!" A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris. On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including Van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that Van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.

Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in <a href="Montmartre">Montmartre</a>, and studied at <a href="Fernand%20Cormon">Fernand Cormon</a>'s studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54 <a href="rue%20Lepic">rue Lepic</a>. In Paris, Vincent painted <a href="Agostina%20Segatori%20Sitting%20in%20the%20Caf%C3%A9%20du%20Tambourin">portraits of friends and acquaintances</a>, <a href="Still%20life%20paintings%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%28Paris%29">still life paintings</a>, views of <a href="Le%20Moulin%20de%20la%20Galette%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Le Moulin de la Galette</a>, <a href="Montmartre%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">scenes in Montmartre</a>, <a href="Asni%C3%A8res%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Asnières</a> and along the <a href="Seine%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Seine</a>. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at <a href="Japonaiserie%20%28Van%20Gogh%29">Japonaiserie</a>, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine "Paris Illustre", "<a href="Copies%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh%23Copy%20after%20Keisai%20Eisen">The Courtesan or Oiran</a>" (1887), after <a href="Keisai%20Eisen">Keisai Eisen</a>, which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.

After seeing the portrait of <a href="Adolphe%20Monticelli">Adolphe Monticelli</a> at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his "<a href="Saintes-Maries%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Seascape at Saintes-Maries</a>" (1888). Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of Monticelli's works to add to his collection.

Van Gogh learned about <a href="Fernand%20Cormon">Fernand Cormon</a>'s <a href="atelier">atelier</a> from Theo. He worked at the studio in April and May 1886, where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist <a href="John%20Peter%20Russell">John Peter Russell</a>, who painted <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%28Russell%20painting%29">his portrait</a> in 1886. Van Gogh also met fellow students <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bernard%20%28painter%29">Émile Bernard</a>, <a href="Louis%20Anquetin">Louis Anquetin</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20Toulouse-Lautrec">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a> – who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at <a href="Portrait%20of%20P%C3%A8re%20Tanguy">Julien "Père" Tanguy</a>'s paint shop, (which was, at that time, the only place where <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>'s paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing <a href="Pointillism">Pointillism</a> and <a href="Neo-impressionism">Neo-impressionism</a> for the first time, and bringing attention to <a href="Georges%20Seurat">Georges Seurat</a> and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.

Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be "almost unbearable". By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to <a href="Asni%C3%A8res-sur-Seine">Asnières</a>, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of <a href="complementary%20colour">complementary colour</a>s – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts.

While in Asnières Van Gogh painted <a href="Asni%C3%A8res%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23Parks">parks</a>, <a href="Asni%C3%A8res%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23Restaurants">restaurants</a> and the <a href="Seine%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Seine</a>, including "<a href="Seine%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23Bridges%20across%20the%20Seine%20at%20Asni%C3%A8res">Bridges across the Seine at Asnières</a>". In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris. Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris. There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like <a href="Camille%20Pissarro">Camille Pissarro</a> and his son <a href="Lucien%20Pissarro">Lucien</a>, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.

Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an <a href="art%20colony">art colony</a>. The Danish artist <a href="Christian%20Mourier-Petersen">Christian Mourier-Petersen</a> became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: "The <a href="Zouave">Zouave</a>s, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world."

The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> and <a href="mauve">mauve</a>. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including "The Old Mill" (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to <a href="Pont-Aven">Pont-Aven</a> on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, <a href="Charles%20Laval">Charles Laval</a> and others.

The portrayals of the Arles landscape are informed by Van Gogh's Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking <a href="Perspective%20%28visual%29">perspective</a>, but excel in their use of colour. His new-found appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work. In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded "perspective frame"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20Artistes%20Ind%C3%A9pendants">Société des Artistes Indépendants</a>. In April, he was visited by the American artist <a href="Dodge%20MacKnight">Dodge MacKnight</a>, who was living nearby at <a href="Fontvieille%2C%20Bouches-du-Rh%C3%B4ne">Fontvieille</a>. On 1 May 1888, for 15 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the <a href="The%20Yellow%20House">Yellow House</a> at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.

On 7 May Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare, having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and <a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28painting%29">Marie Ginoux</a>. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio. He wanted a gallery to display his work, and started a series of paintings that eventually included "<a href="Van%20Gogh%27s%20Chair">Van Gogh's Chair</a>" (1888), "<a href="Bedroom%20in%20Arles">Bedroom in Arles</a>" (1888), "<a href="The%20Night%20Caf%C3%A9">The Night Café</a>" (1888), "<a href="Caf%C3%A9%20Terrace%20at%20Night">Café Terrace at Night</a>" (September 1888), "<a href="Starry%20Night%20Over%20the%20Rhone">Starry Night Over the Rhone</a>" (1888), and "<a href="Sunflowers%20%28series%20of%20paintings%29">Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers</a>" (1888), all intended for the <a href="d%C3%A9coration%20for%20the%20Yellow%20House">decoration for the Yellow House</a>.

Van Gogh wrote that with "The Night Café" he tried "to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime". When he visited <a href="Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer">Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer</a> in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – – and painted <a href="Saintes-Maries%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">boats on the sea and the village</a>. MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Boch">Eugène Boch</a>, a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.

When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the realisation of his idea of an artists' collective. While waiting, in August he painted "<a href="Sunflowers%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Sunflowers</a>". When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study "The Poet Against a Starry Sky."

In preparation for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station's postal supervisor <a href="The%20Roulin%20Family%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Joseph Roulin</a>, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the "<a href="D%C3%A9coration%20for%20the%20Yellow%20House">Décoration for the Yellow House</a>," probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: "Van Gogh's Chair" and "Gauguin's Chair."

After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October, and in November the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his "<a href="The%20Painter%20of%20Sunflowers">The Painter of Sunflowers</a>"; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Among these "imaginative" paintings is "<a href="Memory%20of%20the%20Garden%20at%20Etten%20%28Ladies%20of%20Arles%29">Memory of the Garden at Etten</a>". Their first joint outdoor venture was at the <a href="Alyscamps">Alyscamps</a>, when they produced the pendants "<a href="Les%20Alyscamps">Les Alyscamps</a>". The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was "<a href="The%20Painter%20of%20Sunflowers">Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers</a>".

Van Gogh and Gauguin visited <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a> in December 1888, where they saw works by <a href="Gustave%20Courbet">Courbet</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Delacroix</a> in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Fabre">Musée Fabre</a>. Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of "excessive tension", rapidly headed towards crisis point.

The exact sequence of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known. Gauguin stated, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left the house for a walk, and "rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand". This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.

After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh returned to his room, where he was assaulted by <a href="auditory%20hallucination">voices</a> and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed.

Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown. The hospital diagnosis was "acute mania with generalised delirium", and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care. Gauguin immediately notified Theo, who on 24 December had proposed marriage to his old friend <a href="Andries%20Bonger">Andries Bonger</a>'s sister Johanna. That evening Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day and comforted Vincent, who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening he left Arles for the return trip to Paris.

During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to "be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him." Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Meanwhile, other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.

Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889. He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and <a href="delusion">delusion</a>s of poisoning. In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as "le fou roux" ("the redheaded madman"); Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March; in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home. Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in <a href="Saint-R%C3%A9my-de-Provence">Saint-Rémy-de-Provence</a>. Around this time, he wrote, "Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant."

Van Gogh gave his 1889 "Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey" to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away. In 2016, the portrait was housed at the <a href="Pushkin%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts</a> and estimated to be worth over $50 million.

Van Gogh entered the <a href="Saint-Paul%20Asylum%2C%20Saint-R%C3%A9my%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Saint-Paul-de-Mausole</a> asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his carer, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than from Arles, and was run by a former naval doctor, <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Peyron">Théophile Peyron</a>. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio. The clinic and <a href="Saint-Paul%20Asylum%2C%20Saint-R%C3%A9my%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29%23The%20garden">its garden</a> became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as "Vestibule of the Asylum" and "Saint-Rémy (September 1889)". Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as "<a href="The%20Starry%20Night">The Starry Night</a>". He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted <a href="Cupressus">cypresses</a> and olive trees, including <a href="Olive%20Trees%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">"Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,"</a> "<a href="Cypresses%20%28Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art%29">Cypresses 1889</a>," "Cornfield with Cypresses" (1889), "Country road in Provence by Night" (1890). In September 1889 he produced two further versions of "Bedroom in Arles".

Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on <a href="Copies%20by%20Vincent%20van%20Gogh">interpretations of other artist's paintings</a>, such as <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Millet">Millet</a>'s "The Sower" and "Noonday Rest", and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the <a href="Realism%20%28visual%20art%29">Realism</a> of <a href="Jules%20Breton">Jules Breton</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Courbet">Gustave Courbet</a> and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>.

His "The Round of the Prisoners" (1890) was painted after an <a href="engraving">engraving</a> by <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a> (1832–1883). Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself; <a href="Jan%20Hulsker">Jan Hulsker</a> discounts this.

Between February and April 1890 Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. Depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time, and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases "from memory ... <a href="Houses%20at%20Auvers%23%26quot%3BReminisces%20of%20the%20North%26quot%3B">reminisces of the North</a>". Among these was "Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset". Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh's illness had a significant effect on his work. Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches. Belonging to this period is "<a href="At%20Eternity%27s%20Gate">Sorrowing Old Man ("At Eternity's Gate")</a>", a colour study Hulsker describes as "another unmistakable remembrance of times long past". His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic <a href="Robert%20Hughes%20%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a>, "longing for concision and grace".

<a href="Albert%20Aurier">Albert Aurier</a> praised his work in the "<a href="Mercure%20de%20France">Mercure de France</a>" in January 1890, and described him as "a genius". In February Van Gogh painted five versions of "<a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28painting%29">L'Arlésienne</a> (Madame Ginoux)", based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888. Also in February, Van Gogh was invited by "<a href="Les%20XX">Les XX</a>", a society of <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> painters in Brussels, to participate in <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh%27s%20display%20at%20Les%20XX%2C%201890">their annual exhibition</a>. At the opening dinner a "Les XX" member, <a href="Henry%20de%20Groux">Henry de Groux</a>, insulted Van Gogh's work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group. Later, while Van Gogh's exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris, <a href="Claude%20Monet">Claude Monet</a> said that his work was the best in the show. After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, "I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of <a href="Almond%20Blossoms">white almond blossom</a> against a blue sky."

In May 1890 Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both <a href="Paul%20Gachet">Dr Paul Gachet</a> in <a href="Auvers-sur-Oise">Auvers-sur-Oise</a> and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – <a href="Camille%20Pissarro">Camille Pissarro</a> had recommended him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was "iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much."
The painter <a href="Charles-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Daubigny">Charles Daubigny</a> moved to Auvers in 1861, and in turn drew other artists there, including <a href="Jean-Baptiste-Camille%20Corot">Camille Corot</a> and <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Daumier">Honoré Daumier</a>. In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of "<a href="Daubigny%27s%20Garden">Daubigny's Garden</a>", one of which is likely his final work.
During his last weeks, at Saint-Rémy, his thoughts returned to "<a href="Houses%20at%20Auvers%23%26quot%3BReminisces%20of%20the%20North%26quot%3B">memories of the North</a>", and several of the approximately 70 oils, painted during as many days in Auvers-sur-Oise, are reminiscent of northern scenes. In June 1890, he painted several portraits of his doctor, including "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Dr.%20Gachet">Portrait of Dr Gachet</a>", and his only <a href="etching">etching</a>. In each the emphasis is on Gachet's melancholic disposition. There are other paintings which are probably unfinished, including "<a href="Farms%20near%20Auvers%20%28Van%20Gogh%29">Thatched Cottages by a Hill</a>."

In July, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed "in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow". He had first become captivated by the fields in May, when the wheat was young and green. In July he described to Theo "vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies".

He wrote that they represented his "sadness and extreme loneliness", and that the "canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside". "<a href="Wheatfield%20with%20Crows">Wheatfield with Crows</a>", although not his last oil work, is from July 1890 and Hulsker discusses it as being associated with "melancholy and extreme loneliness". Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings from Auvers that follow the completion of "Wheatfield with Crows".

On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a 7mm <a href="Casimir%20Lefaucheux">Lefaucheux</a> à broche <a href="revolver">revolver</a>. There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the <a href="Auberge%20Ravoux">Auberge Ravoux</a>, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: "The sadness will last forever".
Van Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh, <a href="Andries%20Bonger">Andries Bonger</a>, <a href="Charles%20Laval">Charles Laval</a>, <a href="Lucien%20Pissarro">Lucien Pissarro</a>, Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among twenty family members, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his brother's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at <a href="Den%20Dolder">Den Dolder</a>, and was buried in Utrecht. In 1914, <a href="Johanna%20van%20Gogh-Bonger">Johanna van Gogh-Bonger</a> had Theo's body <a href="exhumation">exhumed</a> and moved from Utrecht to be re-buried alongside Vincent's at Auvers-sur-Oise.

There have been numerous debates as to the nature of <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh%27s%20health">Van Gogh's illness</a> and its effect on his work, and many <a href="retrospective%20diagnosis">retrospective diagnoses</a> have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with <a href="acute%20intermittent%20porphyria">acute intermittent porphyria</a>, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. <a href="Temporal%20lobe%20epilepsy">Temporal lobe epilepsy</a> with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.

Van Gogh drew, and painted with <a href="watercolour%20painting">watercolours</a> while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.

In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working "<a href="en%20plein%20air">en plein air</a>". Vincent wrote that he could now "go on painting with new vigour". From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known <a href="Hague%20School">Hague School</a> artists like <a href="Johan%20Hendrik%20Weissenbruch">Weissenbruch</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Blommers">Blommers</a>, and received technical advice from them, as well as from painters like <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20de%20Bock">De Bock</a> and <a href="Herman%20Johannes%20van%20der%20Weele">Van der Weele</a>, both of the Hague School's second generation. When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them. "The Potato Eaters" and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived. Following a visit to the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the <a href="Dutch%20Masters">Dutch Masters</a>, especially <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> and <a href="Frans%20Hals">Frans Hals</a>. He was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise, so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills.

Theo criticised "The Potato Eaters" for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style. During Van Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His "<a href="Portrait%20of%20P%C3%A8re%20Tanguy">Portrait of Père Tanguy</a>" (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette, and is evidence of an evolving personal style. <a href="Charles%20Blanc">Charles Blanc</a>'s treatise on colour interested him greatly, and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that "colour expresses something in itself". According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a "psychological and moral weight", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of "<a href="The%20Night%20Cafe">The Night Cafe</a>", a work he wanted to "express the terrible passions of humanity". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.

Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature, and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Millet">Jean-François Millet</a>, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian <a href="iconography">iconography</a> he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint "The Sower".
Van Gogh stayed within what he called the "guise of reality", and was critical of overly stylised works. He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of "Starry Night" had gone too far and that reality had "receded too far in the background". Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of <a href="Hokusai">Hokusai</a>'s "<a href="The%20Great%20Wave%20off%20Kanagawa">Great Wave</a>", the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter's vision is "translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint".

Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an "oeuvre", a collection that reflected his personal vision, and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word "purposeful" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies. He painted many series of studies; most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends. The work in Arles contributed considerably to his "oeuvre": those he thought the most important from that time were "The Sower", "Night Cafe", "<a href="Memory%20of%20the%20Garden%20at%20Etten%20%28Ladies%20of%20Arles%29">Memory of the Garden in Etten</a>" and "Starry Night". With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.

Van Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.

The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were "the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite." He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.

In December 1888 he painted "La Berceuse" – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of "Portrait of the Postman" to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in "Madame Roulin with Baby".

Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.

The self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny. Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life, for example the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of <a href="Claude%20Monet">Claude Monet</a>, <a href="Paul%20Cezanne">Paul Cezanne</a> and Signac. In "Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat", heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, "with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a 'purposeful' canvas".

They contain a wide array of <a href="Physiognomy">physiognomical</a> representations. Van Gogh's mental and physical condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.

Van Gogh's gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.

Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, <a href="lilac">lilac</a>s, <a href="iris%20%28plant%29">irises</a>, and <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a>s. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a>. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles, and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are built from <a href="impasto">thickly layered paintwork</a>, which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the "texture of the seed-heads".

In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers ... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go."

The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the "<a href="D%C3%A9coration%20for%20the%20Yellow%20House">Yellow House's guest room</a>" in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the "Berceuse Triptych", and included them in his <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh%27s%20display%20at%20Les%20XX%2C%201890">"Les XX" in Brussels exhibit</a>. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.

Fifteen canvases depict <a href="Cupressus%20sempervirens">cypresses</a>, a tree he became fascinated with in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death. The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: "Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers"; he went on to say, "They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk."

In mid-1889, and at his sister Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of "<a href="Wheat%20Field%20with%20Cypresses">Wheat Field with Cypresses</a>". The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include "The Starry Night", in which cypresses dominate the foreground. In addition to this, other notable works on cypresses include "Cypresses" (1889), "Cypresses with Two Figures" (1889–90), and "<a href="Road%20with%20Cypress%20and%20Star">Road with Cypress and Star</a>" (1890).

During the last six or seven months of the year 1889, he has also created at least fifteen paintings of olive trees, a subject which he considered as demanding and compelling. Among these works are "<a href="Olive%20Trees%20%28Van%20Gogh%20series%29">Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background</a>" (1889), about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote, "At last I have a landscape with olives".While in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum, where he painted trees in the olive groves. In these works natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, which are, according to Hughes, filled with "a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation".

The "<a href="Flowering%20Orchards">Flowering Orchards</a>" (also the "Orchards in Blossom") are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found "a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese". Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and "one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".

During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including "<a href="View%20of%20Arles%2C%20Flowering%20Orchards">View of Arles, Flowering Orchards</a>". Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> his palette significantly brightened.

Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including "The Old Mill" (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in "<a href="The%20Wheat%20Field">The Wheat Field</a>" series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.

Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh's death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns. Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed "in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow".

Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His "Wheatfields at Auvers with White House" shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.

About 10 July 1890 Van Gogh wrote to Theo of "vast fields of wheat under troubled skies". "<a href="Wheatfield%20with%20Crows">Wheatfield with Crows</a>" shows the artist's state of mind in his final days; Hulsker describes the work as a "doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows". Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of menace.
After Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1887 <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Antoine">André Antoine</a> hung Van Gogh's alongside works of <a href="Georges%20Seurat">Georges Seurat</a> and <a href="Paul%20Signac">Paul Signac</a>, at the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Libre">Théâtre Libre</a> in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy. In 1889 his work was described in the journal "<a href="Le%20Moderniste%20Illustr%C3%A9">Le Moderniste Illustré</a>" by Albert Aurier as characterised by "fire, intensity, sunshine". Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890. French president <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Marie François Sadi Carnot</a> was said to have been impressed by Van Gogh's work.

After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at "<a href="Les%20XX">Les XX</a>"; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In 1892 <a href="Octave%20Mirbeau">Octave Mirbeau</a> wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an "infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived."

Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent's most vocal and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.
In 1892 Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894 the <a href="Durand-Ruel">Durand-Rue Gallery</a> in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the <a href="Fauvism">Fauvist painter</a> <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>, then an unknown art student, visited <a href="John%20Peter%20Russell">John Peter Russell</a> on <a href="Belle%20%C3%8Ele">Belle Île</a> off Brittany. Russell had been a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.

In Paris in 1901 a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the <a href="Bernheim-Jeune">Bernheim-Jeune</a> Gallery, which excited <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Derain">André Derain</a> and <a href="Maurice%20de%20Vlaminck">Maurice de Vlaminck</a>, and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism. Important group exhibitions took place with the <a href="Sonderbund%20westdeutscher%20Kunstfreunde%20und%20K%C3%BCnstler">Sonderbund</a> artists in Cologne in 1912, the <a href="Armory%20Show">Armory Show</a>, New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914. <a href="Henk%20Bremmer">Henk Bremmer</a> was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh, and introduced <a href="Helene%20Kr%C3%B6ller-M%C3%BCller">Helene Kröller-Müller</a> to Van Gogh's art; she became an avid collector of his work. The early figures in <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a> such as <a href="Emil%20Nolde">Emil Nolde</a> acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh's work. Bremmer assisted <a href="Jacob%20Baart%20de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bla%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BFaille">Jacob Baart de la Faille</a>, whose "<a href="catalogue%20raisonn%C3%A9">catalogue raisonné</a>" "L'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh" appeared in 1928.

Van Gogh's fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist <a href="Irving%20Stone">Irving Stone</a> wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled "<a href="Lust%20for%20Life%20%28novel%29">Lust for Life</a>", based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the <a href="Lust%20for%20Life%20%28film%29">1956 film</a> further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.

In 1957 <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a> based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh's "The Painter on the Road to Tarascon", the original of which was destroyed during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Bacon was inspired by an image he described as "haunting", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: "[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are ... [T]hey paint them as "they themselves" feel them to be."

Van Gogh's works are among the world's <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20paintings">most expensive paintings</a>. Those sold for over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>100 million (today's equivalent) include "Portrait of Dr Gachet"," " and "Irises". The <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s version of "<a href="Wheat%20Field%20with%20Cypresses">Wheat Field with Cypresses</a>" was acquired in 1993 for US$57 million. In 2015 "<a href="Les%20Alyscamps">L'Allée des Alyscamps</a>" sold for US$66.3 million at Sotheby's, New York, exceeding its reserve of US$40 million.

Van Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978), inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection. Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect <a href="Gerrit%20Rietveld">Gerrit Rietveld</a> was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 <a href="Kisho%20Kurokawa">Kisho Kurokawa</a> took charge. Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.

The <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> opened in the <a href="Museumplein">Museumplein</a> in Amsterdam in 1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a>, regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million; 85 percent of the visitors come from other countries.

Vannevar Bush

Vannevar Bush ( ; March 11, 1890 – June 28, 1974) was an American <a href="engineer">engineer</a>, inventor and science administrator, who during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> headed the U.S. <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), through which almost all wartime military R&D was carried out, including important developments in <a href="radar">radar</a> and the initiation and early administration of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. He emphasized the importance of scientific research to national security and economic well-being, and was chiefly responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>.

Bush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) in 1919, and founded the company now known as <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> in 1922. Bush became vice president of MIT and dean of the <a href="MIT%20School%20of%20Engineering">MIT School of Engineering</a> in 1932, and president of the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington">Carnegie Institution of Washington</a> in 1938.

During his career, Bush patented a string of his own inventions. He is known particularly for his engineering work on <a href="analog%20computer">analog computer</a>s, and for the <a href="memex">memex</a>. 
Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a <a href="Differential%20analyser">differential analyzer</a>, an analog computer with some digital components that could solve <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s with as many as 18 independent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of <a href="digital%20circuit">digital circuit</a> design theory. 
The memex, which he began developing in the 1930s, was a hypothetical adjustable <a href="microfilm">microfilm</a> viewer with a structure analogous to that of <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a>. The memex and Bush's 1945 essay "<a href="As%20We%20May%20Think">As We May Think</a>" influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from his vision of the future.

Bush was appointed to the <a href="National%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">science advisor</a>. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In "Science, The Endless Frontier", his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>.

Vannevar Bush was born in <a href="Everett%2C%20Massachusetts">Everett, Massachusetts</a>, on March 11, 1890, the third child and only son of Perry Bush, the local <a href="Christian%20Universalism">Universalist</a> <a href="pastor">pastor</a>, and his wife Emma Linwood (née Paine). He had two older sisters, Edith and Reba. He was named after John Vannevar, an old friend of the family who had attended <a href="Tufts%20College">Tufts College</a> with Perry. The family moved to <a href="Chelsea%2C%20Massachusetts">Chelsea, Massachusetts</a>, in 1892, and Bush graduated from <a href="Chelsea%20High%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29">Chelsea High School</a> in 1909.

He then attended Tufts, like his father before him. A popular student, he was vice president of his <a href="Sophomore%20year">sophomore</a> class, and president of his <a href="Junior%20%28education%29">junior</a> class. During his <a href="Senior%20%28education%29">senior</a> year, he managed the football team. He became a member of the <a href="Alpha%20Tau%20Omega">Alpha Tau Omega</a> fraternity, and dated Phoebe Clara Davis, who also came from Chelsea. Tufts allowed students to gain a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a> in four years simultaneously with a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>. For his master's <a href="thesis">thesis</a>, Bush invented and patented a "profile tracer". 
This was a mapping device for assisting <a href="Surveying">surveyors</a> that looked like a lawn mower. It had two bicycle wheels, and a pen that plotted the terrain over which it traveled. It was the first of a string of inventions. On graduation in 1913 he received both <a href="bachelor%20of%20science">bachelor of science</a> and <a href="master%20of%20science">master of science</a> degrees.

After graduation, Bush worked at <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> (GE) in <a href="Schenectady%2C%20New%20York">Schenectady, New York</a>, for $14 a week. As a "test man", his job was to assess equipment to ensure that it was safe. He transferred to GE's plant in <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a>, to work on high voltage <a href="transformer">transformer</a>s, but after a fire broke out at the plant, Bush and the other test men were suspended. He returned to Tufts in October 1914 to teach mathematics, and spent the 1915 summer break working at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> as an electrical inspector.
Bush was awarded a $1,500 scholarship to study at <a href="Clark%20University">Clark University</a> as a doctoral student of <a href="Arthur%20Gordon%20Webster">Arthur Gordon Webster</a>, but Webster wanted Bush to study acoustics. Bush preferred to quit rather than study a subject that did not interest him.

Bush subsequently enrolled in the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) electrical engineering program. Spurred by the need for enough financial security to marry, he submitted his thesis, entitled "Oscillating-Current Circuits: An Extension of the Theory of Generalized Angular Velocities, with Applications to the Coupled Circuit and the Artificial Transmission Line", in April 1916. His adviser, <a href="Arthur%20Edwin%20Kennelly">Arthur Edwin Kennelly</a>, tried to demand more work from him, but Bush refused, and Kennelly was overruled by the department chairman; Bush received his doctorate in engineering jointly from MIT and <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. He married Phoebe in August 1916. They had two sons: Richard Davis Bush and John Hathaway Bush.

Bush accepted a job with Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, <a href="Harold%20Power">Harold Power</a>, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, he went to work with the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Research%20Council">National Research Council</a>. He attempted to develop a <a href="magnetic%20anomaly%20detector">means of detecting submarines</a> by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> failed.
Bush left Tufts in 1919, although he remained employed by AMRAD, and joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), where he worked under <a href="Dugald%20C.%20Jackson">Dugald C. Jackson</a>. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on "Principles of Electrical Engineering", an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a <a href="Thermal%20cutoff">thermostatic switch</a> invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management was not interested in the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from <a href="Laurence%20K.%20Marshall">Laurence K. Marshall</a> and <a href="Richard%20S.%20Aldrich">Richard S. Aldrich</a> to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to <a href="Bain%20Capital">Bain Capital</a> in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.

In 1924, Bush and Marshall teamed up with physicist Charles G. Smith, who had invented a device called the S-tube. This enabled radios, which had previously required two different types of batteries, to operate from <a href="Mains%20electricity">mains power</a>. Marshall raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to market the invention, with Bush and Smith among its five directors. The venture made Bush wealthy, and the company, now known as <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>, ultimately became a large electronics company and <a href="defense%20contractor">defense contractor</a>.

Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a <a href="Differential%20analyser">differential analyzer</a>, an <a href="analog%20computer">analog computer</a> that could solve <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s with as many as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving <a href="first-order%20differential%20equation">first-order differential equation</a>s, in 1925. Another student, <a href="Harold%20Locke%20Hazen">Harold Hazen</a>, proposed extending the device to handle <a href="second-order%20differential%20equation">second-order differential equation</a>s. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>'s <a href="Edith%20Clarke">Edith Clarke</a>, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the <a href="Franklin%20Institute">Franklin Institute</a>'s <a href="The%20Franklin%20Institute%20Awards">Louis E. Levy Medal</a> in 1928.

Bush taught <a href="circuit%20theory">circuit theory</a> and <a href="operational%20calculus">operational calculus</a> according to the methods of <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a> while <a href="Samuel%20Wesley%20Stratton">Samuel Wesley Stratton</a> was President of MIT. When <a href="Harold%20Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a> in Cambridge, England, offered his mathematical treatment in "Operational Methods in Mathematical Physics" (1927), Bush responded with his textbook "Operational Circuit Analysis" (1929) for use instructing future electrical engineers. In the preface he wrote:

An offshoot of the work at MIT was the beginning of <a href="digital%20circuit">digital circuit</a> design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of <a href="Boolean%20algebra">Boolean algebra</a> to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, "<a href="A%20Symbolic%20Analysis%20of%20Relay%20and%20Switching%20Circuits">A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits</a>". In 1935, Bush was approached by <a href="OP-20-G">OP-20-G</a>, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in <a href="codebreaking">codebreaking</a>. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.

The reform of the administration of MIT began in 1930 with the appointment of <a href="Karl%20T.%20Compton">Karl T. Compton</a> as president. Bush and Compton soon clashed over the issue of limiting the amount of outside consultancy by professors, a battle Bush quickly lost, but the two men soon built a solid professional relationship. Compton appointed Bush to the newly created post of vice president in 1932. That year Bush also became the dean of the <a href="MIT%20School%20of%20Engineering">MIT School of Engineering</a>. The two positions came with a salary of $12,000 plus $6,000 for expenses per annum.

In May 1938, Bush accepted a prestigious appointment as president of the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington">Carnegie Institution of Washington</a> (CIW), which had been founded in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33 million, and annually spent $1.5 million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was now able to influence research policy in the United States at the highest level, and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems, and he had to ask the <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Corporation</a> for additional funding.

Bush clashed over leadership of the institute with <a href="William%20Cameron%20Forbes">Cameron Forbes</a>, CIW's chairman of the board, and with his predecessor, John Merriam, who continued to offer unwanted advice. A major embarrassment to them all was <a href="Harry%20H.%20Laughlin">Harry H. Laughlin</a>, the head of the <a href="Eugenics%20Record%20Office">Eugenics Record Office</a>, whose activities Merriam had attempted to curtail without success. Bush made it a priority to remove him, regarding him as a scientific fraud, and one of his first acts was to ask for a review of Laughlin's work. In June 1938, Bush asked Laughlin to retire, offering him an annuity, which Laughlin reluctantly accepted. The Eugenics Record Office was renamed the Genetics Record Office, its funding was drastically cut, and it was closed completely in 1944. Senator <a href="Robert%20Rice%20Reynolds">Robert Reynolds</a> attempted to get Laughlin reinstated, but Bush informed the trustees that an inquiry into Laughlin would "show him to be physically incapable of directing an office, and an investigation of his scientific standing would be equally conclusive."

Bush wanted the institute to concentrate on <a href="hard%20science">hard science</a>. He gutted Carnegie's archeology program, setting the field back many years in the United States. He saw little value in the <a href="humanities">humanities</a> and <a href="social%20sciences">social sciences</a>, and slashed funding for "<a href="Isis%20%28journal%29">Isis</a>", a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence. Bush later explained that "I have a great reservation about these studies where somebody goes out and interviews a bunch of people and reads a lot of stuff and writes a book and puts it on a shelf and nobody ever reads it."

On August 23, 1938, Bush was appointed to the <a href="National%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. Its chairman <a href="Joseph%20Sweetman%20Ames">Joseph Sweetman Ames</a> became ill, and Bush, as vice chairman, soon had to act in his place. In December 1938, NACA asked for $11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale, California</a>, to supplement the existing <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory</a>. The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations. This decision was supported by the chief of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, and by the head of the navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a>, <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Arthur%20B.%20Cook">Arthur B. Cook</a>, who between them were planning to spend $225 million on new aircraft in the year ahead. However, Congress was not convinced of its value, and Bush had to appear before the <a href="Senate%20Appropriations%20Committee">Senate Appropriations Committee</a> on April 5, 1939. It was a frustrating experience for Bush, since he had never appeared before Congress before, and the senators were not swayed by his arguments. Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center, now known as the <a href="Ames%20Research%20Center">Ames Research Center</a>, was finally approved. By this time, war had broken out in Europe, and the inferiority of American aircraft engines was apparent, in particular the <a href="Allison%20V-1710">Allison V-1710</a> which performed poorly at high altitudes and had to be removed from the <a href="P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> in favor of the British <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> engine. The NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio, which became the <a href="Glenn%20Research%20Center">Glenn Research Center</a>. Following Ames's retirement in October 1939, Bush became chairman of the NACA, with <a href="George%20J.%20Mead">George J. Mead</a> as his deputy. Bush remained a member of the NACA until November 1948.

During World War I, Bush had become aware of poor cooperation between civilian scientists and the military. Concerned about the lack of coordination in scientific research and the requirements of defense mobilization, Bush proposed the creation of a general directive agency in the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a>, which he discussed with his colleagues. He had the secretary of NACA prepare a draft of the proposed <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) to be presented to Congress, but after the Germans invaded France in May 1940, Bush decided speed was important and approached President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> directly. Through the President's uncle, <a href="Frederic%20Delano">Frederic Delano</a>, Bush managed to set up a meeting with Roosevelt on June 12, 1940, to which he brought a single sheet of paper describing the agency. Roosevelt approved the proposal in 15 minutes, writing "OK — FDR" on the sheet.

With Bush as chairman, the NDRC was functioning even before the agency was officially established by order of the <a href="Council%20of%20National%20Defense">Council of National Defense</a> on June 27, 1940. The organization operated financially on a hand-to-mouth basis with monetary support from the president's emergency fund. Bush appointed four leading scientists to the NDRC: <a href="Karl%20Taylor%20Compton">Karl Taylor Compton</a> (president of MIT), <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a> (president of Harvard University), <a href="Frank%20B.%20Jewett">Frank B. Jewett</a> (president of the National Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Board of Directors of Bell Laboratories), and <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a> (dean of the graduate school at Caltech); Rear Admiral <a href="Harold%20G.%20Bowen%2C%20Sr.">Harold G. Bowen, Sr.</a> and Brigadier General <a href="George%20V.%20Strong">George V. Strong</a> represented the military. The civilians already knew each other well, which allowed the organization to begin functioning immediately. The NDRC established itself in the <a href="Administration%20Building%2C%20Carnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington">administration building</a> at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Each member of the committee was assigned an area of responsibility, while Bush handled coordination. A small number of projects reported to him directly, such as the <a href="S-1%20Executive%20Committee">S-1 Section</a>. Compton's deputy, <a href="Alfred%20Lee%20Loomis">Alfred Loomis</a>, said that "of the men whose death in the Summer of 1940 would have been the greatest calamity for America, the President is first, and Dr. Bush would be second or third."

Bush was fond of saying that "if he made any important contribution to the war effort at all, it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." He established a cordial relationship with <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, and Stimson's assistant, <a href="Harvey%20H.%20Bundy">Harvey H. Bundy</a>, who found Bush "impatient" and "vain", but said he was "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the <a href="Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</a> (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ships">Bureau of Ships</a>, and <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Frank%20Knox">Frank Knox</a> placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.

On August 31, 1940, Bush met with <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>, and arranged a series of meetings between the NDRC and the <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a>, a British scientific delegation. At a meeting On September 19, 1940, the Americans described Loomis and Compton's microwave research. They had an experimental 10 cm wavelength <a href="short%20wave">short wave</a> radar, but admitted that it did not have enough power and that they were at a dead end. <a href="Edward%20George%20Bowen">Taffy Bowen</a> and <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> of the Tizard Mission then produced a <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>, a device more advanced than anything the Americans had seen, with a power output of around 10 <a href="kilowatt">KW</a> at 10 cm, enough to spot the periscope of a surfaced submarine at night from an aircraft. To exploit the invention, Bush decided to create a special laboratory. The NDRC allocated the new laboratory a budget of $455,000 for its first year. Loomis suggested that the lab should be run by the Carnegie Institution, but Bush convinced him that it would best be run by MIT. The <a href="Radiation%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a>, as it came to be known, tested its airborne radar from an Army <a href="Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo">B-18</a> on March 27, 1941. By mid-1941, it had developed <a href="SCR-584%20radar">SCR-584 radar</a>, a mobile radar fire control system for <a href="Antiaircraft%20warfare">antiaircraft guns</a>.

In September 1940, <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> approached Bush with a proposal to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it on the grounds that he did not believe that it could be completed before the end of the war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.

On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt established the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) with the signing of Executive Order 8807. Bush became director of the OSRD while Conant succeeded him as chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. The OSRD was on a firmer financial footing than the NDRC since it received funding from Congress, and had the resources and the authority to develop weapons and technologies with or without the military. Furthermore, the OSRD had a broader mandate than the NDRC, moving into additional areas such as medical research and the mass production of <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> and <a href="sulfa%20drugs">sulfa drugs</a>. The organization grew to 850 full-time employees, and produced between 30,000 and 35,000 reports. The OSRD was involved in some 2,500 contracts, worth in excess of $536 million.

Bush's method of management at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret the mandate of the OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: "Will it help to win a war; "this" war?" Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described Bush as "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals."

In August 1940, the NDRC began work on a <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a>, a fuze inside an artillery shell that would explode when it came close to its target. A radar set, along with the batteries to power it, was miniaturized to fit inside a shell, and its glass <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s designed to withstand the 20,000 <a href="g-force">g-force</a> of being fired from a gun and 500 rotations per second in flight. Unlike normal radar, the proximity fuze sent out a continuous signal rather than short pulses. The NDRC created a special Section T chaired by <a href="Merle%20Tuve">Merle Tuve</a> of the CIW, with <a href="Commander">Commander</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Parsons">William S. Parsons</a> as special assistant to Bush and liaison between the NDRC and the Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a> (BuOrd). One of CIW staff members that Tuve recruited to Section T in 1940 was <a href="James%20Van%20Allen">James Van Allen</a>. In April 1942, Bush placed Section T directly under the OSRD, and Parsons in charge. The research effort remained under Tuve but moved to the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>'s <a href="Applied%20Physics%20Laboratory">Applied Physics Laboratory</a> (APL), where Parsons was BuOrd's representative. In August 1942, a live firing test was conducted with the newly commissioned cruiser ; three <a href="pilotless%20drone">pilotless drone</a>s were shot down in succession.

To preserve the secret of the proximity fuze, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission to use the weapon over land. The proximity fuze proved particularly effective against the <a href="V-1%20%28flying%20bomb%29">V-1 flying bomb</a> over England, and later <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, in 1944. A version was also developed for use with <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s against ground targets. Bush met with the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> in October 1944 to press for its use, arguing that the Germans would be unable to copy and produce it before the war was over. Eventually, the Joint Chiefs agreed to allow its employment from December 25. In response to the German <a href="Ardennes%20Offensive">Ardennes Offensive</a> on December 16, 1944, the immediate use of the proximity fuze was authorized, and it went into action with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, proximity fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day. "If one looks at the proximity fuze program as a whole," historian <a href="James%20Phinney%20Baxter%20III">James Phinney Baxter III</a> wrote, "the magnitude and complexity of the effort rank it among the three or four most extraordinary scientific achievements of the war."

The German V-1 flying bomb demonstrated a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD had some success developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the <a href="V-2">V-2</a> or the <a href="Henschel%20Hs%20293">Henschel Hs 293</a> air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field that had been left to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Dr. <a href="Robert%20H.%20Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a>. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.

Bush played a critical role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, <a href="George%20B.%20Pegram">George B. Pegram</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Beams">Jesse W. Beams</a>, <a href="Ross%20Gunn">Ross Gunn</a> and <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the Section S-1.
Bush met with Roosevelt and Vice President <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a> on October 9, 1941, to discuss the project. He briefed Roosevelt on <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a>, the British atomic bomb project and its <a href="Maud%20Committee">Maud Committee</a>, which had concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the <a href="German%20nuclear%20energy%20project">German nuclear energy project</a>, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the Army</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a>. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would not listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.

In March 1942, Bush sent a report to Roosevelt outlining work by <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> on the <a href="nuclear%20cross%20section">nuclear cross section</a> of <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had <a href="George%20Kistiakowsky">George Kistiakowsky</a> check, estimated that the <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of a sphere of <a href="Uranium-235">Uranium-235</a> was in the range of 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> might be even more <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. After conferring with Brigadier General <a href="Lucius%20D.%20Clay">Lucius D. Clay</a> about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the Section S-1 with a new S-1 Executive Committee.

Bush soon became dissatisfied with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and <a href="United%20States%20Under%20Secretary%20of%20War">Under Secretary of War</a> <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a>. Major General <a href="Brehon%20B.%20Somervell">Brehon B. Somervell</a>, the commander of the army's <a href="Services%20of%20Supply">Services of Supply</a>, appointed Brigadier General <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves">Leslie R. Groves</a> as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, and obtained a AAA priority. At a meeting in Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top Policy Group. The meeting agreed with Bush, and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General <a href="Wilhelm%20D.%20Styer">Wilhelm D. Styer</a>, representing the army, and Rear Admiral <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a> representing the navy.

At the meeting with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush advocated cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British should be limited to technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson, and Bundy met with Anderson, <a href="Lord%20Cherwell">Lord Cherwell</a>, and <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the <a href="Combined%20Policy%20Committee">Combined Policy Committee</a> with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.

Bush appeared on the cover of "Time" magazine on April 3, 1944. He toured the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a> in October 1944, and spoke to ordnance officers, but no senior commander would meet with him. He was able to meet with <a href="Samuel%20Goudsmit">Samuel Goudsmit</a> and other members of the <a href="Alsos%20Mission">Alsos Mission</a>, who assured him that there was no danger from the German project; he conveyed this assessment to Lieutenant General <a href="Bedell%20Smith">Bedell Smith</a>. In May 1945, Bush became part of the <a href="Interim%20Committee">Interim Committee</a> formed to advise the new president, <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, on nuclear weapons. It advised that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning. Bush was present at the <a href="Holloman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range</a> on July 16, 1945, for the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity nuclear test</a>, the first detonation of an atomic bomb. Afterwards, he took his hat off to Oppenheimer in tribute.

Before the end of the Second World War, Bush and Conant had foreseen and sought to avoid a possible <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>. Bush proposed international scientific openness and information sharing as a method of self-regulation for the scientific community, to prevent any one political group gaining a scientific advantage. Before nuclear research became public knowledge, Bush used the development of biological weapons as a model for the discussion of similar issues, an "opening wedge". He was less successful in promoting his ideas in peacetime with President Harry Truman, than he had been under wartime conditions with Roosevelt.

In "<a href="As%20We%20May%20Think">As We May Think</a>", an essay published by the "<a href="Atlantic%20Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a>" in July 1945, Bush wrote: "This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership."

Bush introduced the concept of the "<a href="memex">memex</a>" during the 1930s, which he imagined as a form of memory augmentation involving a <a href="microfilm">microfilm</a>-based "device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory." He wanted the memex to emulate the way the brain links data by association rather than by indexes and traditional, hierarchical storage paradigms, and be easily accessed as "a future device for individual use ... a sort of mechanized private file and library" in the shape of a desk. The memex was also intended as a tool to study the brain itself.

After thinking about the potential of augmented memory for several years, Bush set out his thoughts at length in "<a href="As%20We%20May%20Think">As We May Think</a>", predicting that "wholly new forms of <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>s will appear, ready made with a <a href="hyperlink">mesh of associative trails</a> running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified". A few months later, <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a> published a condensed version of "As We May Think", accompanied by several illustrations showing the possible appearance of a memex machine and its companion devices.

Shortly after "As We May Think" was originally published, <a href="Douglas%20Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> read it, and with Bush's visions in mind, commenced work that would later lead to the invention of the <a href="Mouse%20%28computing%29">mouse</a>. <a href="Ted%20Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, who coined the terms "<a href="hypertext">hypertext</a>" and "<a href="hypermedia">hypermedia</a>", was also greatly influenced by Bush's essay.

"As We May Think" has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay. In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline, Bill Johnston and Sheila Webber wrote in 2005 that

Bush was concerned that <a href="information%20overload">information overload</a> might inhibit the research efforts of scientists. Looking to the future, he predicted a time when "there is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers."

The OSRD continued to function actively until some time after the end of hostilities, but by 1946–1947 it had been reduced to a minimal staff charged with finishing work remaining from the war period; Bush was calling for its closure even before the war had ended. During the war, the OSRD had issued contracts as it had seen fit, with just eight organizations accounting for half of its spending. MIT was the largest to receive funds, with its obvious ties to Bush and his close associates. Efforts to obtain legislation exempting the OSRD from the usual government <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> regulations failed, leaving Bush and other OSRD principals open to prosecution. Bush therefore pressed for OSRD to be wound up as soon as possible.

With its dissolution, Bush and others had hoped that an equivalent peacetime government research and development agency would replace the OSRD. Bush felt that basic research was important to national survival for both military and commercial reasons, requiring continued government support for science and technology; technical superiority could be a <a href="Deterrence%20theory">deterrent</a> to future enemy aggression. In "Science, The Endless Frontier", a July 1945 report to the president, Bush maintained that basic research was "the pacemaker of technological progress". "New products and new processes do not appear full-grown," Bush wrote in the report. "They are founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms of science!" In Bush's view, the "purest realms" were the physical and medical sciences; he did not propose funding the <a href="social%20science">social science</a>s. In "Science, The Endless Frontier", science historian <a href="Daniel%20Kevles">Daniel Kevles</a> later wrote, Bush "insisted upon the principle of Federal patronage for the advancement of knowledge in the United States, a departure that came to govern Federal science policy after World War II."
In July 1945, the Kilgore bill was introduced in Congress, proposing the appointment and removal of a single science administrator by the president, with emphasis on applied research, and a patent clause favoring a government monopoly. In contrast, the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush's proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them. The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights. A compromise Kilgore–Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in the House because Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of Magnuson's original bill. A Senate bill was introduced in February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation (NSF) to replace the OSRD. This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush, including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board. The bill passed the Senate and the House, but was <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>ed by Truman on August 6, on the grounds that the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress. The OSRD was abolished without a successor organization on December 31, 1947.

Without a <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, the military stepped in, with the <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Research">Office of Naval Research</a> (ONR) filling the gap. The war had accustomed many scientists to working without the budgetary constraints imposed by pre-war universities. Bush helped create the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) of the Army and Navy, of which he was chairman. With passage of the <a href="National%20Security%20Act%20of%201947">National Security Act</a> on July 26, 1947, the JRDB became the Research and Development Board (RDB). Its role was to promote research through the military until a bill creating the National Science Foundation finally became law. By 1953, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> was spending $1.6 billion a year on research; physicists were spending 70 percent of their time on defense related research, and 98 percent of the money spent on physics came from either the Department of Defense or the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC), which took over from the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947. Legislation to create the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> finally passed through Congress and was signed into law by Truman in 1950.

The authority that Bush had as chairman of the RDB was much different from the power and influence he enjoyed as director of OSRD and would have enjoyed in the agency he had hoped would be independent of the Executive branch and Congress. He was never happy with the position and resigned as chairman of the RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee. He continued to be skeptical about rockets and missiles, writing in his 1949 book, "Modern Arms and Free Men", that <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s would not be technically feasible "for a long time to come ... if ever".

With Truman as president, men like <a href="John%20R.%20Steelman">John R. Steelman</a>, who was appointed chairman of the President's Scientific Research Board in October 1946, came to prominence. Bush's authority, both among scientists and politicians, suffered a rapid decline, though he remained a revered figure. In September 1949, he was appointed to head a scientific panel that included Oppenheimer to review the evidence that the Soviet Union had <a href="RDS-1">tested its first atomic bomb</a>. The panel concluded that it had, and this finding was relayed to Truman, who made the public announcement. Bush was outraged when <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">a security hearing</a> stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954; he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer's accusers in "The New York Times". <a href="Alfred%20Friendly">Alfred Friendly</a> summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become "the Grand Old Man of American science".

Bush continued to serve on the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a <a href="turbojet">turbojet</a> engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> told him that "even if it were a better engine, [General Motors] would not be interested in it." Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. "Madison Avenue believes", he said, "that if you tell the public something absurd, but do it enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities."

From 1947–1962, Bush was on the board of directors for <a href="American%20Telephone%20and%20Telegraph">American Telephone and Telegraph</a>. He retired as president of the Carnegie Institution and returned to Massachusetts in 1955, but remained a director of Metals and Controls Corporation from 1952–1959, and of <a href="Merck%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Merck & Co.</a> 1949–1962. Bush became chairman of the board at Merck following the death of <a href="George%20W.%20Merck">George W. Merck</a>, serving until 1962. He worked closely with the company's president, <a href="Max%20Tishler">Max Tishler</a>, although Bush was concerned about Tishler's reluctance to delegate responsibility. Bush distrusted the company's sales organization, but supported Tishler's research and development efforts. He was a trustee of Tufts College 1943–1962, of Johns Hopkins University 1943–1955, of the Carnegie Corporation of New York 1939–1950, the Carnegie Institution of Washington 1958–1974, and the George Putnam Fund of Boston 1956–1972, and was a regent of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> 1943–1955.

Bush received the <a href="AIEE">AIEE</a>'s <a href="Edison%20Medal">Edison Medal</a> in 1943, "for his contribution to the advancement of electrical engineering, particularly through the development of new applications of mathematics to engineering problems, and for his eminent service to the nation in guiding the war research program." In 1945, Bush was awarded the <a href="Public%20Welfare%20Medal">Public Welfare Medal</a> from the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>. In 1949, he received the <a href="IRI%20Medal">IRI Medal</a> from the <a href="Industrial%20Research%20Institute">Industrial Research Institute</a> in recognition of his contributions as a leader of research and development. President Truman awarded Bush the Medal of Merit with bronze oak leaf cluster in 1948, President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> awarded him the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Science">National Medal of Science</a> in 1963, and President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> presented him with the Atomic Pioneers Award from the Atomic Energy Commission in February 1970. Bush was also made a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1948, and an Officer of the French <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor">Legion of Honor</a> in 1955.

After suffering a stroke, Bush died in <a href="Belmont%2C%20Massachusetts">Belmont, Massachusetts</a>, at the age of 84 from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on June 28, 1974. He was survived by his sons Richard (a surgeon) and John (president of <a href="Millipore%20Corporation">Millipore Corporation</a>) and by six grandchildren and his sister Edith. Bush's wife had died in 1969. He was buried at South Dennis Cemetery in <a href="South%20Dennis%2C%20Massachusetts">South Dennis, Massachusetts</a>, after a private funeral service. At a public memorial subsequently held by MIT, <a href="Jerome%20Wiesner">Jerome Wiesner</a> declared "No American has had greater influence in the growth of science and technology than Vannevar Bush".

In 1980, the National Science Foundation created the <a href="Vannevar%20Bush%20Award">Vannevar Bush Award</a> to honor his contributions to public service. The Vannevar Bush papers are located in several places, with the majority of the collection held at the Library of Congress. Additional papers are held by the MIT Institute Archives and Special Collections, the Carnegie Institution, and the National Archives and Records Administration.

Vivien Leigh

Vivien Leigh (; born Vivian Mary Hartley, and styled as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 19138 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress.

She won two <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>, for her iconic performances as <a href="Scarlett%20O%27Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a> in "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939) and <a href="Blanche%20DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in the film version of <a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%281951%20film%29">"A Streetcar Named Desire"</a> (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> in 1949. She also won a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Leading%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical">Tony Award</a> for her work in the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical version of "<a href="Tovarich%20%28musical%29">Tovarich</a>" (1963).

After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in "<a href="Fire%20Over%20England">Fire Over England</a>" (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> comedies to classic <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> characters such as <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a>, <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra</a>, <a href="Juliet%20Capulet">Juliet</a>, and <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>. Later in life, she performed as a <a href="character%20actress">character actress</a> in a few films.

At the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life, she suffered from <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> ranked Leigh as <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars">the 16th greatest female movie star</a> of classic Hollywood cinema.

Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> on the campus of <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20Darjeeling">St. Paul's School, Darjeeling</a>. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (née Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1882, while her mother, a devout <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, was born in <a href="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a> in 1888 and may have been of <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> and <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> or <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> ancestry. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an <a href="Irish%20Indians">Irish family</a> killed during the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, London.

In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> as an officer in the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Cavalry</a>, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in <a href="Ootacamund">Ootacamund</a>. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting "<a href="Little%20Bo%20Peep">Little Bo Peep</a>". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a> and <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, as well as stories of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and <a href="Indian%20folklore">Indian folklore</a>. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from <a href="Loreto%20Convent%2C%20Darjeeling">Loreto Convent, Darjeeling</a>, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now <a href="Woldingham%20School">Woldingham School</a>) then situated in <a href="Roehampton">Roehampton</a>, southwest London. One of her friends there was future actress <a href="Maureen%20O%27Sullivan">Maureen O'Sullivan</a>, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become "a great actress". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in <a href="Dinard">Dinard</a> (Brittany, France), <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a> (France), the Sacred Heart in San Remo on the Italian Riviera, and in Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended "<a href="A%20Connecticut%20Yankee%20%28film%29">A Connecticut Yankee</a>", one of O'Sullivan's films playing in <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">London's West End</a>, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA) in London.

Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of "theatrical people", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, <a href="Suzanne%20Farrington">Suzanne</a>, later Mrs. Robin Farrington.

Leigh's friends suggested she take a small role as a schoolgirl in the film "Things Are Looking Up", which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that "Vivian Holman" was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took "Vivian Leigh" as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Alexander Korda</a> as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential. She was cast in the play "The Mask of Virtue", directed by <a href="Sidney%20Carroll">Sidney Carroll</a> in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>", in which the interviewer noted "a lightning change came over her face", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her. <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, the future <a href="poet%20laureate">poet laureate</a>, described her as "the essence of English girlhood". Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract. She continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to "Vivien".

In 1960 Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, "that some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him."

Laurence Olivier saw Leigh in "The Mask of Virtue", and a friendship developed after he congratulated her on her performance. Olivier and Leigh began an affair while acting as lovers in "<a href="Fire%20Over%20England">Fire Over England</a>" (1937), but Olivier was still married to actress <a href="Jill%20Esmond">Jill Esmond</a>. During this period, Leigh read the <a href="Margaret%20Mitchell">Margaret Mitchell</a> novel "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28novel%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" and instructed her American agent to recommend her to <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, who was planning a film version. She remarked to a journalist, "I've cast myself as Scarlett O'Hara", and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" film critic <a href="C.%20A.%20Lejeune">C. A. Lejeune</a> recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh "stunned us all" with the assertion that Olivier "won't play <a href="Rhett%20Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, but I shall play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see."

Despite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier's <a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> in an <a href="Old%20Vic%20Theatre">Old Vic Theatre</a> production staged at <a href="Elsinore">Elsinore</a>, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.

Leigh appeared with <a href="Robert%20Taylor%20%28actor%29">Robert Taylor</a>, <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a> and Maureen O'Sullivan in "<a href="A%20Yank%20at%20Oxford">A Yank at Oxford</a>" (1938), which was the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in "<a href="Sidewalks%20of%20London">Sidewalks of London</a>", also known as "St. Martin's Lane" (1938), with <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>.

Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of <a href="Heathcliff%20%28Wuthering%20Heights%29">Heathcliff</a> in <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a>'s production of "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights%20%281939%20film%29">Wuthering Heights</a>" (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to <a href="Merle%20Oberon">Merle Oberon</a>.

<a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> was in the midst of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray <a href="Scarlett%20O%27Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a> in David O. Selznick's production of "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939). At the time, <a href="Myron%20Selznick">Myron Selznick</a>—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical <a href="agent%20%28law%29">agent</a>—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.

David O. Selznick watched her performances that month in "Fire Over England" and "A Yank at Oxford" and thought that she was excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett because she was "too British". Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the right person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara." The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a> with director <a href="George%20Cukor">George Cukor</a> and wrote to his wife, "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to <a href="Paulette%20Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a>, <a href="Jean%20Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>, <a href="Joan%20Bennett">Joan Bennett</a> and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's "incredible wildness". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.

Filming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts. Leigh befriended Clark Gable, his wife <a href="Carole%20Lombard">Carole Lombard</a> and Olivia de Havilland; but she clashed with <a href="Leslie%20Howard%20%28actor%29">Leslie Howard</a>, with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes. Leigh was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress; and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York City. On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared: "Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!"

Quoted in a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of her <a href="mania">manic behaviour</a> during the filming of "Gone with the Wind": "Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on "Gone with the Wind". She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York."

"Gone with the Wind" brought Leigh immediate attention and fame; but she was quoted as saying, "I'm not a film star – I'm an actress. Being a film star – just a film star – is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvellous parts to play." The film won 10 <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> including a <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> award for Leigh, who also won a <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress</a>.

In February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Laurence Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Vivien, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the <a href="San%20Ysidro%20Ranch">San Ysidro Ranch</a> in <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara</a>, California, in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald</a> and Benita Colman and witnesses, <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href="Garson%20Kanin">Garson Kanin</a>. Leigh had made a screen test and hoped to co-star with Olivier in "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>", which was to be directed by <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh's screen test, David Selznick noted that "she doesn't seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.

Selznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast <a href="Joan%20Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. He refused to allow her to join Olivier in "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281940%20film%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>" (1940), and <a href="Greer%20Garson">Greer Garson</a> played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. "<a href="Waterloo%20Bridge%20%281940%20film%29">Waterloo Bridge</a>" (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>'s most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.

The Oliviers mounted a stage production of "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" for <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>. The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the <a href="World%20War%20II">war</a> effort.

Critics were hostile in their assessment of "Romeo and Juliet". <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote: "Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people, they hardly act their parts at all." While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with <a href="Bernard%20Grebanier">Bernard Grebanier</a> commenting on the "thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice". The couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 in the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.

The Oliviers filmed "<a href="That%20Hamilton%20Woman">That Hamilton Woman</a>" (1941) with Olivier as <a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a> and Leigh as <a href="Emma%20Hamilton">Emma Hamilton</a>. With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> arranged a screening for a party that included <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part." The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, "By Jove, she's a clinker."

The Oliviers returned to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa that same year as part of a revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week in order to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left <a href="human%20lung">lung</a> and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28film%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>" (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in an hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode – several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.

With her doctor's approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of <a href="Thornton%20Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>'s "<a href="The%20Skin%20of%20Our%20Teeth">The Skin of Our Teeth</a>"; but her films of this period, "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28film%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>" (1945) and "<a href="Anna%20Karenina%20%281948%20film%29">Anna Karenina</a>" (1948), were not great commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films. In 1947 Olivier was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> and Leigh accompanied him to <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier. After their divorce, according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.

By 1948 Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" and also performed with Leigh in "<a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>" and "The Skin of Our Teeth". The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a> and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." Later, he would observe that he "lost Vivien" in Australia.

The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, "<a href="Antigone%20%28Sophocles%29">Antigone</a>," included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>.

Leigh next sought the role of <a href="Blanche%20DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in the West End stage production of <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>'s "<a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%28play%29">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>" and was cast after Williams and the play's producer <a href="Irene%20Mayer%20Selznick">Irene Mayer Selznick</a> saw her in "<a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>" and "<a href="Antigone">Antigone</a>"; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a <a href="rape">rape</a> scene and references to <a href="promiscuity">promiscuity</a> and <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, and was destined to be controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.

When the West End production of "Streetcar" opened in October 1949, <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a>, who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances, commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were "too well-bred to emote effectively on stage". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the <a href="Greek%20tragedy">Greek tragedy</a> that they envisioned. The play also had strong supporters, among them Noël Coward, who described Leigh as "magnificent".

After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the <a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%281951%20film%29">film version</a> of the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured <a href="Jessica%20Tandy">Jessica Tandy</a> and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that "she had a small talent." As work progressed, however, he became "full of admiration" for "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance." Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me." Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with <a href="Jennifer%20Jones">Jennifer Jones</a> in <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>'s "<a href="Carrie%20%281952%20film%29">Carrie</a>" (1952).

Leigh's performance in "A Streetcar Named Desire" won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role "everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois "tipped me over into madness".

In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier performed two plays about <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28play%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>", alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the <a href="Ziegfeld%20Theatre%20%281927%29">Ziegfeld Theatre</a> into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.

In January 1953, Leigh travelled to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> to film "<a href="Elephant%20Walk">Elephant Walk</a>" with <a href="Peter%20Finch">Peter Finch</a>. Shortly after filming commenced, she had a nervous breakdown and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> replaced her with <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>. Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him. Over a period of several months, she gradually recovered. As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> said she had been "quite, quite mad". Noël Coward expressed surprise in his diary that "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts". Leigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.

Also in 1953, Leigh recovered sufficiently to play "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>" with Olivier, and in 1955 they performed a season at <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in Shakespeare's "<a href="Twelfth%20Night%2C%20or%20What%20You%20Will">Twelfth Night</a>", "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", and "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>". They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable. <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> directed "Twelfth Night" and wrote, "... perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but "not" a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently ... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice." In 1955 Leigh starred in <a href="Anatole%20Litvak">Anatole Litvak</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Deep%20Blue%20Sea%20%281955%20film%29">The Deep Blue Sea</a>"; co-star <a href="Kenneth%20More">Kenneth More</a> felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.

In 1956, Leigh took the lead role in the Noël Coward play "<a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble%20%28play%29">South Sea Bubble</a>", but withdrew from the production when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> that lasted for months. She joined Olivier for a European tour of "Titus Andronicus", but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.

In 1958, considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with actor <a href="John%20Merivale">Jack Merivale</a>, who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier that he would care for her. In 1959, when she achieved a success with the Noël Coward comedy "<a href="Look%20After%20Lulu%21">Look After Lulu!</a>", a critic working for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described her as "beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation".

In 1960 she and Olivier divorced and Olivier soon married actress <a href="Joan%20Plowright">Joan Plowright</a>. In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of strain they had experienced because of Leigh's illness: "Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness – an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble."

Merivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by <a href="Radie%20Harris">Radie Harris</a> as confiding that she "would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him". Her first husband Leigh Holman also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier. Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in "<a href="Tovarich%20%28musical%29">Tovarich</a>". She also appeared in the films "<a href="The%20Roman%20Spring%20of%20Mrs.%20Stone">The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone</a>" (1961) and "<a href="Ship%20of%20Fools%20%28film%29">Ship of Fools</a>" (1965).

Leigh's last screen appearance in "Ship of Fools" was both a triumph and emblematic of her illnesses that were taking root. Producer and director Stanley Kramer, who ended up with the film, planned to star Leigh but was initially unaware of her fragile mental and physical state. Later recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role, "She was ill, and the courage to go ahead, the courage to make the film – was almost unbelievable." Leigh's performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both <a href="Simone%20Signoret">Simone Signoret</a> and <a href="Lee%20Marvin">Lee Marvin</a> were sympathetic and understanding. In one unusual instance during the attempted rape scene, Leigh became distraught and hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe that it marked his face. Leigh won the "L'Étoile de Cristal" for her performance in a leading role in "Ship of Fools".

In May 1967 Leigh was rehearsing to appear with <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a> in <a href="Edward%20Albee">Edward Albee</a>'s "<a href="A%20Delicate%20Balance%20%28play%29">A Delicate Balance</a>" when her tuberculosis recurred. Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now 8 July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, she collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his "grievous anguish" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and "stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements; Olivier stayed until her body was removed from the flat.

Her death was publicly announced on 8 July, and the lights of every theatre in central London were extinguished for an hour. A <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholic</a> service for Leigh was held at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%2C%20Cadogan%20Street">St. Mary's Church, Cadogan Street</a>, London. Her funeral was attended by the luminaries of British stage and screen. According to the provisions of her will, Leigh was <a href="Cremation">cremated</a> at the <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her summer home, Tickerage Mill, near <a href="Blackboys">Blackboys</a>, East Sussex, England. A memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>, with a final tribute read by John Gielgud. In 1968 Leigh became the first actress honoured in the United States, by "The Friends of the Libraries at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>". The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor, who screened the tests that Leigh had made for "Gone with the Wind", the first time the screen tests had been seen in 30 years.

Leigh was considered to be one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, "People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you."

Director George Cukor described Leigh as a "consummate actress, hampered by beauty", and Laurence Olivier said that critics should "give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty." Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses – simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired."

Leigh explained that she played "as many different parts as possible" in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, "It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."

Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of "Gone with the Wind". In December 1939, film critic <a href="Frank%20Nugent">Frank Nugent</a> wrote in "The New York Times", "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable", and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine as Scarlett. In 1969 critic <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> commented that the success of the film had been largely due to "the inspired casting" of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that "she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence". Film historian and critic <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh "brilliantly played" her role.

Her performance in the West End production of "A Streetcar Named Desire", described by the theatre writer <a href="Phyllis%20Hartnoll">Phyllis Hartnoll</a> as "proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown", led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre. Discussing the subsequent film version, <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave "two of the greatest performances ever put on film" and that Leigh's was "one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity."

Her greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of "Titus Andronicus", commenting that she "receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber." He was also critical of her reinterpretation of <a href="Lady%20Macbeth%20%28Shakespeare%29">Lady Macbeth</a> in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as "one of the worst errors of judgment" he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, "made more sense ... than the usual battle-axe" portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.

In 1969 a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors' Church, <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>, London. In 1985 a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> and David Niven to commemorate "British Film Year". In April 2013 she was again included in another series, this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth, achieving the rare accolade for a non-royal of appearing on British stamps on more than one occasion.
The <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> in London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as "The Laurence Olivier Archive", the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier. The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington. In 1994 the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library of Australia</a> purchased a photograph album, monogrammed "L & V O" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia. In 2013, an archive of Vivien Leigh's letters, diaries, photographs, annotated film and theatre scripts and her numerous awards was acquired by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>.

William Shakespeare

William Shakespeare (<a href="baptism">bapt.</a> 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's <a href="List%20of%20national%20poets">national poet</a> and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including <a href="William%20Shakespeare%27s%20collaborations">collaborations</a>, consist of approximately <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20plays">39 plays</a>, <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20sonnets">154 sonnets</a>, two long <a href="narrative%20poem">narrative poem</a>s, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major <a href="modern%20language">living language</a> and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

Shakespeare was born and raised in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>. At the age of 18, he married <a href="Anne%20Hathaway%20%28wife%20of%20Shakespeare%29">Anne Hathaway</a>, with whom he had three children: <a href="Susanna%20Hall">Susanna</a> and twins <a href="Hamnet%20Shakespeare">Hamnet</a> and <a href="Judith%20Quiney">Judith</a>. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a <a href="playing%20company">playing company</a> called the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%27s%20Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>, later known as the <a href="King%27s%20Men%20%28playing%20company%29">King's Men</a>. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as <a href="Portraits%20of%20Shakespeare">his physical appearance</a>, <a href="sexuality%20of%20William%20Shakespeare">his sexuality</a>, <a href="Religious%20views%20of%20William%20Shakespeare">his religious beliefs</a>, and whether the works attributed to him were <a href="Shakespeare%20authorship%20question">written by others</a>. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.

Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily <a href="Shakespearean%20comedy">comedies</a> and <a href="Shakespearean%20history">histories</a> and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly <a href="Shakespearean%20tragedy">tragedies</a>, among them "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>", "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", and "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote <a href="tragicomedy">tragicomedies</a> (also known as <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20late%20romances">romances</a>) and collaborated with other playwrights.

Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, <a href="John%20Heminges">John Heminges</a> and <a href="Henry%20Condell">Henry Condell</a>, published a more definitive text known as the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.

William Shakespeare was the son of <a href="John%20Shakespeare">John Shakespeare</a>, an <a href="alderman">alderman</a> and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from <a href="Snitterfield">Snitterfield</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Shakespeare">Mary Arden</a>, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. He was born in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, <a href="Saint%20George%27s%20Day">Saint George's Day</a>. This date, which can be traced to a mistake made by an 18th-century scholar, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.
Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the <a href="King%20Edward%20VI%20School%2C%20Stratford-upon-Avon">King's New School</a> in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. <a href="Grammar%20school">Grammar school</a>s varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic <a href="Latin">Latin</a> text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin <a href="classics">classical</a> authors.

At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old <a href="Anne%20Hathaway%20%28Shakespeare%27s%20wife%29">Anne Hathaway</a>. The <a href="consistory%20court">consistory court</a> of the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">Diocese of Worcester</a> issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> allowed the <a href="Banns%20of%20marriage">marriage banns</a> to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, <a href="Susanna%20Hall">Susanna</a>, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son <a href="Hamnet%20Shakespeare">Hamnet</a> and daughter <a href="Judith%20Quiney">Judith</a>, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.

After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the "complaints bill" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated <a href="Michaelmas%20Term">Michaelmas Term</a> 1588 and 9 October 1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years". Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many <a href="wikt%3Aapocryphal">apocryphal</a> stories. <a href="Nicholas%20Rowe%20%28writer%29">Nicholas Rowe</a>, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer <a href="poaching">poaching</a> in the estate of local squire <a href="Thomas%20Lucy">Thomas Lucy</a>. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London. <a href="John%20Aubrey">John Aubrey</a> reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, a Catholic landowner who named a certain "William Shakeshafte" in his will. Little evidence substantiates such stories other than <a href="wikt%3Ahearsay">hearsay</a> collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.

It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright <a href="Robert%20Greene%20%28dramatist%29">Robert Greene</a> in his "<a href="Greene%27s%20Groats-Worth%20of%20Wit">Groats-Worth of Wit</a>":

... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his "Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide", supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute "Johannes factotum", is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.

Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Nashe">Thomas Nashe</a>, and Greene himself (the so-called "<a href="University%20Wits">University Wits</a>"). The italicised phrase parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's "<a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%203">Henry VI, Part 3</a>", along with the pun "Shake-scene", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, "<a href="Jack%20of%20all%20trades%2C%20master%20of%20none">Johannes Factotum</a>" ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common "universal genius".

Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%27s%20Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a>, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading <a href="playing%20company">playing company</a> in London. After the death of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a> in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James I</a>, and changed its name to the <a href="King%27s%20Men%20%28playing%20company%29">King's Men</a>.

In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, which they named the <a href="Globe%20Theatre">Globe</a>. In 1608, the partnership also took over the <a href="Blackfriars%20Theatre">Blackfriars indoor theatre</a>. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, <a href="New%20Place">New Place</a>, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish <a href="tithes">tithes</a> in Stratford.

Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in <a href="Quarto%20%28binding%29">quarto</a> editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the <a href="title%20page">title page</a>s. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>'s "Works" names him on the cast lists for "<a href="Every%20Man%20in%20His%20Humour">Every Man in His Humour</a>" (1598) and "<a href="Sejanus%20His%20Fall">Sejanus His Fall</a>" (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's "<a href="Volpone">Volpone</a>" is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a> of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after "Volpone", although we cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, <a href="John%20Davies%20of%20Hereford">John Davies of Hereford</a> wrote that "good Will" played "kingly" roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", and the Chorus in "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>", though scholars doubt the sources of that information.

Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen's, <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a>, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a> by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.

<a href="Nicholas%20Rowe%20%28writer%29">Rowe</a> was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Johnson</a>, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford "some years before his death". He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, <a href="Cuthbert%20Burbage">Cuthbert Burbage</a> stated that after purchasing the lease of the <a href="Blackfriars%20Theatre">Blackfriars Theatre</a> in 1608 from <a href="Henry%20Evans%20%28theatre%29">Henry Evans</a>, the King's Men "placed men players" there, "which were <a href="John%20Heminges">Heminges</a>, <a href="Henry%20Condell">Condell</a>, Shakespeare, etc.". However, it is perhaps relevant that the <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in "<a href="Bellott%20v.%20Mountjoy">Bellott v. Mountjoy</a>", a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> in the former <a href="Blackfriars%2C%20London">Blackfriars</a> priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, <a href="John%20Hall%20%28physician%29">John Hall</a>. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a>, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.

Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in "perfect health". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, <a href="John%20Ward%20%28vicar%29">John Ward</a>, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and <a href="Michael%20Drayton">Drayton</a>. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room."

He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married <a href="Thomas%20Quiney">Thomas Quiney</a>, a <a href="vintner">vintner</a>, two months before Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.

Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body". The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line. Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.

Shakespeare was buried in the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Stratford-upon-Avon">Holy Trinity Church</a> two days after his death. The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:

<poem>"Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,"
"To digg the dvst encloased heare."
"Bleste be man spares thes stones,"
"And cvrst be he moves my bones."
</poem>

Some time before 1623, a <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20funerary%20monument">funerary monument</a> was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to <a href="Nestor%20%28mythology%29">Nestor</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>. In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, the <a href="Droeshout%20engraving">Droeshout engraving</a> was published.

Shakespeare has been commemorated in many <a href="Memorials%20to%20William%20Shakespeare">statues and memorials</a> around the world, including funeral monuments in <a href="Southwark%20Cathedral">Southwark Cathedral</a> and <a href="Poets%27%20Corner">Poets' Corner</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career. Some attributions, such as "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>" and the early history plays, remain controversial while "<a href="The%20Two%20Noble%20Kinsmen">The Two Noble Kinsmen</a>" and the lost "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Cardenio">Cardenio</a>" have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.

The first recorded works of Shakespeare are "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" and the three parts of "<a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%201">Henry VI</a>", written in the early 1590s during a vogue for <a href="History%20%28theatrical%20genre%29">historical drama</a>. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that "Titus Andronicus", "<a href="The%20Comedy%20of%20Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>", "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>," and "<a href="The%20Two%20Gentlemen%20of%20Verona">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a>" may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first <a href="Shakespearean%20history">histories</a>, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's <a href="Holinshed%27s%20Chronicles">"Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland"</a>, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially <a href="Thomas%20Kyd">Thomas Kyd</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>. "The Comedy of Errors" was also based on classical models, but no source for "The Taming of the Shrew" has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like "The Two Gentlemen of Verona", in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the "Shrew's" story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.

Shakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic "<a href="The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice">Merchant of Venice</a>", contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a>, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of "<a href="Much%20Ado%20About%20Nothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a>", the charming rural setting of "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", and the lively merrymaking of "<a href="Twelfth%20Night">Twelfth Night</a>" complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>", written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, parts 1</a>" and "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">2</a>", and "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>". His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>", the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>"—based on Sir <a href="Thomas%20North">Thomas North</a>'s 1579 translation of <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>"—which introduced a new kind of drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in "Julius Caesar," "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other".

In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called "<a href="Shakespearean%20problem%20play">problem plays</a>" "<a href="Measure%20for%20Measure">Measure for Measure</a>", "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</a>", and "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well">All's Well That Ends Well</a>" and a number of his best known <a href="Shakespearean%20tragedy">tragedies</a>. Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a> which begins "<a href="To%20be%2C%20or%20not%20to%20be">To be or not to be; that is the question</a>". Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>", the villain <a href="Iago">Iago</a> stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, "the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty". In "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" and "<a href="Coriolanus">Coriolanus</a>", contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>.

In his final period, Shakespeare turned to <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20late%20romances">romance</a> or <a href="tragicomedy">tragicomedy</a> and completed three more major plays: "<a href="Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a>", "<a href="The%20Winter%27s%20Tale">The Winter's Tale</a>," and "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", as well as the collaboration, "<a href="Pericles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Tyre">Pericles, Prince of Tyre</a>". Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, "<a href="Henry%20VIII%20%28play%29">Henry VIII</a>" and "<a href="The%20Two%20Noble%20Kinsmen">The Two Noble Kinsmen</a>", probably with <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a>.

It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of "Titus Andronicus" reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the <a href="Black%20Death%20in%20England">plagues</a> of 1592–3, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at <a href="The%20Theatre">The Theatre</a> and the <a href="Curtain%20Theatre">Curtain</a> in <a href="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of "Henry IV", <a href="Leonard%20Digges%20%28writer%29">Leonard Digges</a> recording, "Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room". When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the <a href="Globe%20Theatre">Globe Theatre</a>, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with "Julius Caesar" one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including "Hamlet", "Othello," and "King Lear".
After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the <a href="King%27s%20Men%20%28playing%20company%29">King's Men</a> in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James</a>. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of "The Merchant of Venice". After 1608, they performed at the indoor <a href="Blackfriars%20Theatre">Blackfriars Theatre</a> during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobean</a> fashion for lavishly staged <a href="masques">masques</a>, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In "Cymbeline", for example, <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."

The actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous <a href="Richard%20Burbage">Richard Burbage</a>, <a href="William%20Kempe">William Kempe</a>, <a href="Henry%20Condell">Henry Condell</a> and <a href="John%20Heminges">John Heminges</a>. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including "Richard III", "Hamlet", "Othello", and "King Lear". The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in "Romeo and Juliet" and <a href="Dogberry">Dogberry</a> in "Much Ado About Nothing", among other characters. He was replaced around 1600 by <a href="Robert%20Armin">Robert Armin</a>, who played roles such as <a href="Touchstone%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Touchstone</a> in "As You Like It" and the fool in "King Lear". In 1613, Sir <a href="Henry%20Wotton">Henry Wotton</a> recorded that "Henry VIII" "was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony". On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.

In 1623, <a href="John%20Heminges">John Heminges</a> and <a href="Henry%20Condell">Henry Condell</a>, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time. Many of the plays had already appeared in <a href="Book%20size">quarto</a> versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious copies". Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the First Folio.

<a href="Alfred%20W.%20Pollard">Alfred Pollard</a> termed some of the pre-1623 versions as "<a href="bad%20quarto">bad quarto</a>s" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20plays%23Shakespeare%20and%20the%20textual%20problem">differs from the other</a>. The differences may stem from copying or <a href="Typesetting%23Letterpress%20era">printing</a> errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own <a href="foul%20papers">papers</a>. In some cases, for example, "Hamlet", "Troilus and Cressida," and "Othello", Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the "Oxford Shakespeare" prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.

In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of <a href="Bubonic%20plague">plague</a>, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, "<a href="Venus%20and%20Adonis%20%28Shakespeare%20poem%29">Venus and Adonis</a>" and "<a href="The%20Rape%20of%20Lucrece">The Rape of Lucrece</a>". He dedicated them to <a href="Henry%20Wriothesley%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton</a>. In "Venus and Adonis", an innocent <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a> rejects the sexual advances of <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>; while in "The Rape of Lucrece", the virtuous wife <a href="Lucretia">Lucrece</a> is raped by the lustful <a href="Sextus%20Tarquinius">Tarquin</a>. Influenced by <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, "<a href="A%20Lover%27s%20Complaint">A Lover's Complaint</a>", in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the "Sonnets" in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote "A Lover's Complaint". Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20and%20the%20Turtle">The Phoenix and the Turtle</a>", printed in Robert Chester's 1601 "Love's Martyr", mourns the deaths of the legendary <a href="phoenix%20%28mythology%29">phoenix</a> and his lover, the faithful <a href="European%20turtle%20dove">turtle dove</a>. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in "<a href="The%20Passionate%20Pilgrim">The Passionate Pilgrim</a>", published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.

Published in 1609, the "<a href="Shakespeare%27s%20sonnets">Sonnets</a>" were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in "The Passionate Pilgrim" in 1599, <a href="Francis%20Meres">Francis Meres</a> had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's "sugred Sonnets among his private friends". Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence. He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the "fair youth"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial "I" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though <a href="Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a> believed that with the sonnets "Shakespeare unlocked his heart".

The 1609 edition was dedicated to a "Mr. W.H.", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, <a href="Thomas%20Thorpe">Thomas Thorpe</a>, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. Critics praise the "Sonnets" as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.
Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in "<a href="Titus%20Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>", in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in "<a href="The%20Two%20Gentlemen%20of%20Verona">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a>" has been described as stilted.

However, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening <a href="soliloquy">soliloquy</a> of "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" has its roots in the self-declaration of <a href="the%20Vice">Vice</a> in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of "Romeo and Juliet", "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>", and "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

Shakespeare's standard poetic form was <a href="blank%20verse">blank verse</a>, composed in <a href="iambic%20pentameter">iambic pentameter</a>. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the <a href="End-stopping">end of lines</a>, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>" and "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>". Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:

After "Hamlet", Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic <a href="A.%20C.%20Bradley">A. C. Bradley</a> described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical". In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included <a href="enjambment">run-on lines</a>, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: "was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?" (1.7.35–38); "... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ..." (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.

Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> and <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Holinshed</a>. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20late%20romances">Shakespeare's late romances</a>, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.

Shakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of <a href="characterisation">characterisation</a>, plot, <a href="language">language</a>, and genre. Until "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>", for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. <a href="Soliloquy">Soliloquies</a> had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds. His work heavily influenced later poetry. The <a href="Romanticism">Romantic poets</a> attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic <a href="George%20Steiner">George Steiner</a> described all English verse dramas from <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a> to <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a> as "feeble variations on Shakespearean themes."

Shakespeare influenced novelists such as <a href="Thomas%20Hardy%20%28writer%29">Thomas Hardy</a>, <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. The American novelist <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" is a classic <a href="tragic%20hero">tragic hero</a>, inspired by "King Lear". Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include three operas by <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, "<a href="Macbeth%20%28opera%29">Macbeth</a>", "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>" and "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>", whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelites</a>. The Swiss Romantic artist <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, a friend of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, even translated "Macbeth" into German. The <a href="psychoanalyst">psychoanalyst</a> <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.

In Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern English. <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> quoted him more often than any other author in his "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">A Dictionary of the English Language</a>", the first serious work of its type. Expressions such as "with bated breath" ("Merchant of Venice") and "a foregone conclusion" ("Othello") have found their way into everyday English speech.

Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise. In 1598, the cleric and author <a href="Francis%20Meres">Francis Meres</a> singled him out from a group of English writers as "the most excellent" in both comedy and tragedy. The authors of the "Parnassus" plays at <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>, numbered him with <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, <a href="John%20Gower">Gower</a>, and <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Spenser</a>. In the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> called Shakespeare the "Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage", although he had remarked elsewhere that "Shakespeare wanted art".

Between <a href="the%20Restoration">the Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a> and Ben Jonson. <a href="Thomas%20Rymer">Thomas Rymer</a>, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a> rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, "I admire him, but I love Shakespeare". For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> in 1765 and <a href="Edmond%20Malone">Edmond Malone</a> in 1790, added to his growing reputation. By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>, <a href="Stendhal">Stendhal</a>, and <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>.

During the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic era</a>, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, and the critic <a href="August%20Wilhelm%20Schlegel">August Wilhelm Schlegel</a> translated his plays in the spirit of <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romanticism</a>. In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation. "That King Shakespeare," the essayist <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> wrote in 1840, "does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible". The <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorians</a> produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. The playwright and critic <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as "<a href="bardolatry">bardolatry</a>", claiming that the new <a href="Naturalism%20%28theatre%29">naturalism</a> of <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen's</a> plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.

The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>. The <a href="German%20expressionism">Expressionists in Germany</a> and the <a href="Futurism">Futurists</a> in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> devised an <a href="epic%20theatre">epic theatre</a> under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's "primitiveness" in fact made him truly modern. Eliot, along with <a href="G.%20Wilson%20Knight">G. Wilson Knight</a> and the school of <a href="New%20Criticism">New Criticism</a>, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for "<a href="postmodernism">post-modern</a>" studies of Shakespeare. By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as <a href="structuralism">structuralism</a>, feminism, <a href="New%20Historicism">New Historicism</a>, <a href="African-American%20studies">African-American studies</a>, and <a href="queer%20studies">queer studies</a>. In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare's works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that "Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He "encloses" us because we "see" with his fundamental perceptions."

Shakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a> of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as <a href="Shakespearean%20comedy">comedies</a>, <a href="Shakespearean%20history">histories</a>, and <a href="Shakespearean%20tragedy">tragedies</a>. Two plays not included in the First Folio, "<a href="The%20Two%20Noble%20Kinsmen">The Two Noble Kinsmen</a>" and "<a href="Pericles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Tyre">Pericles, Prince of Tyre</a>", are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.

In the late 19th century, <a href="Edward%20Dowden">Edward Dowden</a> classified four of the late comedies as <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20late%20romances">romances</a>, and though many scholars prefer to call them "<a href="Tragicomedy">tragicomedies</a>", Dowden's term is often used. In 1896, <a href="Frederick%20S.%20Boas">Frederick S. Boas</a> coined the term "<a href="Shakespearean%20problem%20play">problem plays</a>" to describe four plays: "<a href="All%27s%20Well%20That%20Ends%20Well">All's Well That Ends Well</a>", "<a href="Measure%20for%20Measure">Measure for Measure</a>", "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</a>," and "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>". "Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies", he wrote. "We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays." The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though "Hamlet" is definitively classed as a tragedy.
Around 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. Proposed alternative candidates include <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>, and <a href="Edward%20de%20Vere%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford</a>. Several "group theories" have also been proposed. Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution, but interest in the subject, particularly the <a href="Oxfordian%20theory%20of%20Shakespeare%20authorship">Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship</a>, continues into the 21st century.

Shakespeare conformed to the official state religion, but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20will">Shakespeare's will</a> uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeare's mother, <a href="Mary%20Shakespeare">Mary Arden</a>, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, <a href="John%20Shakespeare">John Shakespeare</a>, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church "for fear of process for debt", a common Catholic excuse. In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> in Stratford. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.

Few details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old <a href="Anne%20Hathaway%20%28Shakespeare%27s%20wife%29">Anne Hathaway</a>, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. The 26 so-called <a href="Dark%20Lady%20%28Shakespeare%29">"Dark Lady"</a> sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.

No written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the <a href="Droeshout%20engraving">Droeshout engraving</a>, which <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> approved of as a good likeness, and his <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20funerary%20monument">Stratford monument</a> provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.

Walt Disney

Walter Elias Disney (; December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the <a href="Modern%20animation%20in%20the%20United%20States">American animation industry</a>, he introduced several developments in the production of <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a>s. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe</a> Special Achievement Awards and an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney Brothers Studio</a> with his brother <a href="Roy%20O.%20Disney">Roy</a>. With <a href="Ub%20Iwerks">Ub Iwerks</a>, Walt developed the character <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>, <a href="feature-length">feature-length</a> cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" (1937), "<a href="Pinocchio%20%281940%20film%29">Pinocchio</a>", "<a href="Fantasia%20%281940%20film%29">Fantasia</a>" (both 1940), "<a href="Dumbo">Dumbo</a>" (1941), and "<a href="Bambi">Bambi</a>" (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and <a href="live-action">live-action</a> films followed after World War II, including the critically successful "<a href="Cinderella%20%281950%20film%29">Cinderella</a>" (1950) and "<a href="Mary%20Poppins%20%28film%29">Mary Poppins</a>" (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.

In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a> industry, and in 1955 he opened <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as "<a href="Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series">Walt Disney's Disneyland</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>"; he was also involved in planning the <a href="American%20National%20Exhibition">1959 Moscow Fair</a>, the <a href="1960%20Winter%20Olympics">1960 Winter Olympics</a>, and the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 New York World's Fair</a>. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Disney World</a>, the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the "<a href="EPCOT%20%28concept%29">Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</a>" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life, and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.

Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was <a href="Racism">racist</a> or <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a>, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of <a href="American%20imperialism">American imperialism</a>. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national <a href="cultural%20icon">cultural icon</a>. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.

Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's <a href="Hermosa%2C%20Chicago">Hermosa</a> neighborhood. He was the fourth son of <a href="Elias%20Disney">Elias Disney</a>born in the <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">Province of Canada</a>, to Irish parentsand <a href="Flora%20Call%20Disney">Flora</a> ( Call), an American of German and English descent. Aside from Disney, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and <a href="Roy%20O.%20Disney">Roy</a>; the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903. In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in <a href="Marceline%2C%20Missouri">Marceline, Missouri</a>, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land. In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor. Elias was a subscriber to the "<a href="Appeal%20to%20Reason%20%28newspaper%29">Appeal to Reason</a>" newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of <a href="Ryan%20Walker%20%28cartoonist%29">Ryan Walker</a>. Disney also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons. He lived near the <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a> line and became enamored with trains. He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.

In 1911, the Disneys moved to <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>" and "<a href="Kansas%20City%20Times">Kansas City Times</a>". Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the "Times" before school and repeated the round for the evening "Star" after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Art%20Institute">Kansas City Art Institute</a> and also took a <a href="correspondence%20course">correspondence course</a> in cartooning.

In 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family. Disney enrolled at <a href="McKinley%20High%20School%20%28Chicago%29">McKinley High School</a> and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I; he also took night courses at the <a href="Chicago%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Chicago Academy of Fine Arts</a>. In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> to fight <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">against the Germans</a>, but he was rejected for being too young. After <a href="age%20fabrication">forging the date of birth</a> on his birth certificate, he joined the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">the armistice</a>. He drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper "<a href="Stars%20and%20Stripes%20%28newspaper%29">Stars and Stripes</a>". Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919, where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist <a href="Ub%20Iwerks">Ub Iwerks</a>.

In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined. The company produced commercials using the <a href="cutout%20animation">cutout animation</a> technique. Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as "<a href="Mutt%20and%20Jeff">Mutt and Jeff</a>" and "<a href="Koko%20the%20Clown">Koko the Clown</a>". With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home. He came to the conclusion that <a href="cel%20animation">cel animation</a> was more promising than the cutout method. Unable to persuade Cauger to try <a href="cel">cel</a> animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, <a href="Fred%20Harman">Fred Harman</a>. Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as "Newman's Laugh-O-Grams". Disney studied <a href="Paul%20Terry%20%28cartoonist%29">Paul Terry's</a> "<a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables%20%28film%20series%29">Aesop's Fables</a>" as a model, and the first six "Laugh-O-Grams" were modernized fairy tales.
In May 1921, the success of the "Laugh-O-Grams" led to the establishment of <a href="Laugh-O-Gram%20Studio">Laugh-O-Gram Studio</a>, for which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman's brother <a href="Harman%20and%20Ising">Hugh</a>, <a href="Harman%20and%20Ising">Rudolf Ising</a> and Iwerks. The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production of "<a href="Alice%27s%20Wonderland">Alice's Wonderland</a>"based on "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>"which combined live action with animation; he cast <a href="Virginia%20Davis">Virginia Davis</a> in <a href="Alice%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">the title role</a>. The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, <a href="short%20film">one-reel</a> film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.

Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> there, and he hoped to become a live-action film director. Disney's efforts to sell "Alice's Wonderland" were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor <a href="Margaret%20J.%20Winkler">Margaret J. Winkler</a>. She was losing the rights to both the "<a href="Out%20of%20the%20Inkwell">Out of the Inkwell</a>" and "<a href="Felix%20the%20Cat">Felix the Cat</a>" cartoons, and needed a new series. In October, they signed a contract for six <a href="Alice%20Comedies">"Alice" comedies</a>, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>to produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.

Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, <a href="Lillian%20Disney">Lillian Bounds</a>. They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her hometown of <a href="Lewiston%2C%20Idaho">Lewiston, Idaho</a>. The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer <a href="Neal%20Gabler">Neal Gabler</a> she did not "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'." Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, "content with household management and providing support for her husband". Their marriage produced two daughters, <a href="Diane%20Disney%20Miller">Diane</a> (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within <a href="Disney%20family">the family</a>, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point. The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the <a href="Lindbergh%20kidnapping">Lindbergh kidnapping</a>; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.
By 1926 Winkler's role in the distribution of the "Alice" series had been handed over to her husband, the film producer <a href="Charles%20Mintz">Charles Mintz</a>, although the relationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained. The series ran until July 1927, by which time Disney had begun to tire of it and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation. After Mintz requested new material to distribute through <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>, Disney and Iwerks created <a href="Oswald%20the%20Lucky%20Rabbit">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit</a>, a character Disney wanted to be "peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim".

In February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the "Oswald" series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, Ising, <a href="Carman%20Maxwell">Carman Maxwell</a> and <a href="Friz%20Freleng">Friz Freleng</a>. Disney also found out that Universal owned the <a href="intellectual%20property%20rights">intellectual property rights</a> to Oswald. Mintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.

To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear. Disney's original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but Lillian thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey instead. Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself from the animation process, provided Mickey's voice until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, "Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul."
Mickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short "<a href="Plane%20Crazy">Plane Crazy</a>", but it, and the second feature, "<a href="The%20Gallopin%27%20Gaucho">The Gallopin' Gaucho</a>", failed to find a distributor. Following the 1927 sensation "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer">The Jazz Singer</a>", Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, "<a href="Steamboat%20Willie">Steamboat Willie</a>", to create the first post-produced <a href="sound%20film">sound cartoon</a>. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, <a href="Pat%20Powers%20%28businessman%29">Pat Powers</a>, to use the "Powers Cinephone" recording system; Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.

To improve the quality of the music, Disney hired the professional composer and arranger <a href="Carl%20Stalling">Carl Stalling</a>, on whose suggestion the "<a href="Silly%20Symphony">Silly Symphony</a>" series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, "<a href="The%20Skeleton%20Dance">The Skeleton Dance</a>" (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the <a href="Disney%27s%20Nine%20Old%20Men">Nine Old Men</a>. Both the Mickey Mouse and "Silly Symphonies" series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants <a href="Inbetweening">sketch the inbetween poses</a>. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overworkso he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.
With the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became increasingly popular, including internationally. Disney, always keen to embrace new technology, filmed "<a href="Flowers%20and%20Trees">Flowers and Trees</a>" (1932) in full-color three-strip <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>; he was also able to negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process until August 31, 1935. All subsequent "Silly Symphony" cartoons were in color. "Flowers and Trees" was popular with audiences and won the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for best <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Short%20Film">Short Subject (Cartoon)</a> at the <a href="5th%20Academy%20Awards">1932 ceremony</a>. Disney had been nominated for another film in that category, "<a href="Mickey%27s%20Orphans">Mickey's Orphans</a>", and received an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Honorary Award</a> "for the creation of Mickey Mouse".

In 1933, Disney produced "<a href="The%20Three%20Little%20Pigs%20%28film%29">The Three Little Pigs</a>", a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as "the most successful short animation of all time". The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category. The film's success led to a further increase in the studio's staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year. Disney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that would interest the audience, and he invested in a "story department" separate from the animators, with <a href="storyboard%20artist">storyboard artist</a>s who would detail the plots of Disney's films.

By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, and believed a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable. The studio began the four-year production of "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>", based on <a href="Snow%20White">the fairy tale</a>. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it "Disney's Folly". The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to producethree times over budget. To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the <a href="Chouinard%20Art%20Institute">Chouinard Art Institute</a>; he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement. To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a <a href="multiplane%20camera">multiplane camera</a> which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene. The first work created on the cameraa "Silly Symphony" called "<a href="The%20Old%20Mill">The Old Mill</a>" (1937)won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power. Although "Snow White" had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.

"Snow White" premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film made to that date. Disney won another Honorary Academy Award, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar statuettes. The success of "Snow White" heralded one of the most productive eras for the studio; <a href="the%20Walt%20Disney%20Family%20Museum">the Walt Disney Family Museum</a> calls the following years "the 'Golden Age of Animation'". With work on "Snow White" finished, the studio began producing "<a href="Pinocchio%20%281940%20film%29">Pinocchio</a>" in early 1938 and "<a href="Fantasia%20%281940%20film%29">Fantasia</a>" in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box officepartly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939. The studio made a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of February 1941.

In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">first public stock offering</a> in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to <a href="Disney%20animators%27%20strike">a 1941 animators' strike</a> which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Coordinator%20of%20Inter-American%20Affairs">Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs</a> to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. As a result of the strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, "<a href="Dumbo">Dumbo</a>" (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.

Shortly after the release of "Dumbo" in October 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as "Four Methods of Flush Riveting" and "Aircraft Production Methods". Disney also met with <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%2C%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>, and agreed to produce short <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a> cartoons to promote <a href="Series%20E%20bond">war bonds</a>. Disney also produced several <a href="Walt%20Disney%27s%20World%20War%20II%20propaganda%20production">propaganda productions</a>, including shorts such as "<a href="Der%20Fuehrer%27s%20Face">Der Fuehrer's Face</a>"which won an Academy Awardand the 1943 feature film "<a href="Victory%20Through%20Air%20Power%20%28film%29">Victory Through Air Power</a>".

The military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film "<a href="Bambi">Bambi</a>"which had been in production since 1937underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia", the company had debts of $4 million with the <a href="Bank%20of%20America">Bank of America</a> in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss the future of the company, the bank's chairman and founder, <a href="Amadeo%20Giannini">Amadeo Giannini</a>, told his executives, "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk. ... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after. ... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Cartoons">Warner Bros.</a> and <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer%20cartoon%20studio">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled "<a href="True-Life%20Adventures">True-Life Adventures</a>", with "<a href="Seal%20Island%20%28film%29">Seal Island</a>" the first; the film won the Academy Award in the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Live%20Action%20Short%20Film">Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)</a> category.

Disney grew more politically conservative as he got older. A <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> supporter until the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 presidential election</a>, when he switched allegiance to the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, he became a generous donor to <a href="Thomas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BE.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">1944 bid for the presidency</a>. In 1946, he was a founding member of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Alliance%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20American%20Ideals">Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals</a>, an organization who stated they "believ[ed] in, and like, the American Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life". In 1947, during the <a href="Second%20Red%20Scare">Second Red Scare</a>, Disney testified before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC), where he branded <a href="Herbert%20Sorrell">Herbert Sorrell</a>, <a href="David%20Hilberman">David Hilberman</a> and <a href="William%20Pomerance">William Pomerance</a>, former animators and <a href="trade%20union">labor union</a> organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.
In 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home in the <a href="Holmby%20Hills">Holmby Hills</a> district of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends <a href="Ward%20Kimball">Ward and Betty Kimball</a>, who already had their own <a href="Grizzly%20Flats%20Railroad">backyard railroad</a>, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature <a href="live%20steam">live steam</a> railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, <a href="Carolwood%20Pacific%20Railroad">Carolwood Pacific Railroad</a>, came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer <a href="Roger%20E.%20Broggie">Roger E. Broggie</a>, and Disney named it "Lilly Belle" after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.

In early 1950, Disney produced "<a href="Cinderella%20%281950%20film%29">Cinderella</a>", his studio's first animated feature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first year. Disney was less involved than he had been with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, "<a href="Treasure%20Island%20%281950%20film%29">Treasure Island</a>" (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Robin%20Hood%20and%20His%20Merrie%20Men">The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men</a>" (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including "<a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland%20%281951%20film%29">Alice in Wonderland</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Peter%20Pan%20%281953%20film%29">Peter Pan</a>" (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.
For several years Disney had been considering building a theme park. When he visited <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a> in Los Angeles with his daughters, he wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. He visited the <a href="Tivoli%20Gardens">Tivoli Gardens</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park. In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim</a>, south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studiowhich might attract the criticism of shareholdersDisney formed WED Enterprises (now <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering">Walt Disney Imagineering</a>) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans; those involved became known as "Imagineers". After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, <a href="American%20Broadcasting-Paramount%20Theatres">American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres</a>part of <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC)and <a href="Western%20Publishing">Western Printing and Lithographing Company</a>. In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design. Construction work started in July 1954, and <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70 million viewers. The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central <a href="Main%20Street%2C%20U.S.A.">Main Street, U.S.A.</a>a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were <a href="Adventureland%20%28Disney%29">Adventureland</a>, <a href="Frontierland">Frontierland</a>, <a href="Fantasyland">Fantasyland</a> and <a href="Tomorrowland">Tomorrowland</a>. The park also contained the <a href="Narrow-gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="Disneyland%20Railroad">Disneyland Railroad</a> that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high <a href="berm">berm</a> to separate the park from the outside world. An editorial in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" considered that Disney had "tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow". Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6 million guests.

The money from ABC was contingent on Disney television programs. The studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of "Alice in Wonderland". Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, he wrote that "television can be a most powerful selling aid for us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise that we enter television when we do". In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast "<a href="Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series">Walt Disney's Disneyland</a>", an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%. In April 1955, "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" called the series an "American institution". ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, "<a href="The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>", a variety show catering specifically to children. The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show). One of the segments of "Disneyland" consisted of the five-part <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> "<a href="Davy%20Crockett%20%28miniseries%29">Davy Crockett</a>" which, according to Gabler, "became an overnight sensation". The show's theme song, "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Davy%20Crockett">The Ballad of Davy Crockett</a>", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold. As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Records">Disneyland Records</a>.

As well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects away from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 <a href="American%20National%20Exhibition">American National Exhibition</a> in Moscow; Disney Studios' contribution was "<a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20%28Disney%29">America the Beautiful</a>", a 19-minute film in the 360-degree <a href="Circle-Vision%20360%C2%B0">Circarama theater</a> that was one of the most popular attractions. The following year he acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the <a href="1960%20Winter%20Olympics">1960 Winter Olympics</a> at <a href="Squaw%20Valley%2C%20Placer%20County%2C%20California">Squaw Valley, California</a>, where he designed the <a href="Olympic%20Games%20ceremony">opening, closing and medal ceremonies</a>.
Despite the demands wrought by non-studio projects, Disney continued to work on film and television projects. In 1955, he was involved in "<a href="Man%20in%20Space">Man in Space</a>", an episode of the "Disneyland" series, which was made in collaboration with <a href="NASA">NASA</a> rocket designer <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>. Disney also oversaw aspects of the full-length features "<a href="Lady%20and%20the%20Tramp">Lady and the Tramp</a>" (the first animated film in <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a>) in 1955, "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauty%20%281959%20film%29">Sleeping Beauty</a>" (the first animated film in <a href="Technirama">Technirama</a> <a href="70%20mm%20film">70 mm film</a>) in 1959, "<a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a>" (the first animated feature film to use <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Xerography">Xerox cels</a>) in 1961, and "<a href="The%20Sword%20in%20the%20Stone%20%28film%29">The Sword in the Stone</a>" in 1963.

In 1964, Disney produced "<a href="Mary%20Poppins%20%28film%29">Mary Poppins</a>", based on <a href="Mary%20Poppins">the book series</a> by <a href="P.%20L.%20Travers">P. L. Travers</a>; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20the%20Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a> (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.

Disney provided four exhibits for the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 New York World's Fair</a>, for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For <a href="PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a>, who planned a tribute to <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>, Disney developed <a href="It%27s%20a%20Small%20World">It's a Small World</a>, a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; <a href="Great%20Moments%20with%20Mr.%20Lincoln">Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln</a> contained an animatronic <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> giving excerpts from his speeches; <a href="Walt%20Disney%27s%20Carousel%20of%20Progress">Carousel of Progress</a> promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibitsprincipally concepts and technologywere re-installed in Disneyland, although It's a Small World is the ride that most closely resembles the original.

During the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a> in <a href="Mineral%20King">Mineral King</a>, a glacial valley in California's <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28US%29">Sierra Nevada</a>. He hired experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer <a href="Willy%20Schaeffler">Willy Schaeffler</a>. With income from Disneyland accounting for an increasing proportion of the studio's income, Disney continued to look for venues for other attractions. In late 1965, he announced plans to develop another theme park to be called "Disney World" (now <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a>), a few miles southwest of <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. Disney World was to include the "Magic Kingdom"a larger and more elaborate version of Disneylandplus golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of Disney World was to be the "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (<a href="EPCOT%20%28concept%29">EPCOT</a>), which he described as:

an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.

During 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT. He increased his involvement in the studio's films, and was heavily involved in the story development of "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Book%20%281967%20film%29">The Jungle Book</a>", the live-action musical feature "<a href="The%20Happiest%20Millionaire">The Happiest Millionaire</a>" (both 1967) and the animated short "<a href="Winnie%20the%20Pooh%20and%20the%20Blustery%20Day">Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day</a>".

Disney had been a <a href="Chain%20smoking">heavy smoker</a> since World War I. He did not use cigarettes with <a href="cigarette%20filter">filters</a> and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In November 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with <a href="cobalt%20therapy">cobalt therapy</a>. On November 30 he felt unwell and was taken to <a href="Providence%20Saint%20Joseph%20Medical%20Center">St. Joseph Hospital</a> where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of <a href="circulatory%20collapse">circulatory collapse</a> caused by lung cancer. Disney's remains were cremated two days later, and his ashes interred at the <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Glendale%29">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> in <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale, California</a>.

His estate included a 14 percent holding in Walt Disney Productions worth $20 million. He left 45 percent of his estate to his wife and childrenmuch in a family trustand 10 percent to his sister, nieces and nephews. The remaining 45 percent went into a charitable trust, 95 percent of which was designated for CalArts, to build a new campus (a figure of around $15 million); he also donated of the Golden Oaks ranch in <a href="Valencia%2C%20Santa%20Clarita%2C%20California">Valencia</a> for construction of that school. The university moved there in November 1971.

The release of "The Jungle Book" and "The Happiest Millionaire" in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81. When "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" describes as the "<a href="Disney%20Renaissance">Disney Renaissance</a>" that began with "<a href="The%20Little%20Mermaid%20%281989%20film%29">The Little Mermaid</a>" (1989). Disney's companies continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.
Disney's plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother. Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of <a href="Epcot%20Center">Epcot Center</a> in 1982; Walt Disney's vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent <a href="world%27s%20fair">world's fair</a>. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the <a href="Presidio%20of%20San%20Francisco">Presidio of San Francisco</a>. Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received. In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.

Disney has been portrayed numerous times in fictional works. <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> references Disney in his 1938 novel "<a href="The%20Holy%20Terror%20%28Wells%20novel%29">The Holy Terror</a>", in which World Dictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator. Disney was portrayed by <a href="Len%20Cariou">Len Cariou</a> in the 1995 made-for-TV film "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story", and by <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> in the 2013 film "<a href="Saving%20Mr.%20Banks">Saving Mr. Banks</a>". In 2001, the German author <a href="Peter%20Stephan%20Jungk">Peter Stephan Jungk</a> published (trans: "The King of America"), a fictional work of Disney's later years that re-imagines him as a power-hungry racist. The composer <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> later adapted the book into the opera "<a href="The%20Perfect%20American">The Perfect American</a>" (2013).

Disney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records. He was nominated for three <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s, but did not win, but he was presented with two Special Achievement Awardsfor "Bambi" (1942) and "<a href="The%20Living%20Desert">The Living Desert</a>" (1953)and the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award">Cecil B. DeMille Award</a>. He also received four <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations, winning once, for Best Producer for the "Disneyland" television series. Several of his films are included in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant": "Steamboat Willie", "The Three Little Pigs", "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "Fantasia", "Pinocchio", "Bambi" and "Mary Poppins". In 1998, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> published a list of the 100 greatest American films, according to industry experts; the list included "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (at number 49), and "Fantasia" (at 58).

In February 1960, Disney was inducted to the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> with two stars, one for motion pictures and the other for his television work; Mickey Mouse was given his own star for motion pictures in 1978. Disney was also inducted into the <a href="Television%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Television Hall of Fame</a> in 1986, the <a href="California%20Hall%20of%20Fame">California Hall of Fame</a> in December 2006, and was the inaugural recipient of a star on the <a href="Anaheim/Orange%20County%20Walk%20of%20Stars">Anaheim walk of stars</a> in 2014.

The Walt Disney Family Museum records that he "along with members of his staff, received more than 950 honors and citations from throughout the world". He was made a in the French in 1935, and in 1952 he was awarded the country's highest artistic decoration, the . Other national awards include Thailand's Order of the Crown; Brazil's Order of the Southern Cross and Mexico's Order of the Aztec Eagle. In the United States, he received the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> on September 14, 1964, and in 1969, he was posthumously awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>. He received the Showman of the World Award from the National Association of Theatre Owners, and in 1955, the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a> awarded Disney its highest honor, the Audubon Medal, for promoting the "appreciation and understanding of nature" through his "True-Life Adventures" nature films. A <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a> discovered in 1980 by astronomer <a href="Lyudmila%20Karachkina">Lyudmila Karachkina</a>, was named <a href="4017%20Disneya">4017 Disneya</a>, and he was also awarded honorary degrees from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>, <a href="Yale">Yale</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>.

Disney's public persona was very different from his actual personality. Playwright <a href="Robert%20E.%20Sherwood">Robert E. Sherwood</a> described him as "almost painfully shy ... diffident" and self-deprecating. According to his biographer <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a>, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that "I'm not Walt Disney. I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." Critic <a href="Otis%20Ferguson">Otis Ferguson</a>, in "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", called the private Disney: "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.

Views of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions. Mark Langer, in the "American Dictionary of National Biography", writes that "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture." Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas", while <a href="PBS">PBS</a> records that critics have censured his work because of its "smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history". Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time, there were criticisms by reviewers. <a href="C.%20A.%20Lejeune">Caroline Lejeune</a> comments in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" that "Snow White" (1937) "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn." Robin Allen, writing for "The Times", notes that "Fantasia" (1940) was "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into <a href="bathos">bathos</a>", while Lejeune, reviewing "Alice in Wonderland" (1951), feels the film "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy". "Peter Pan" (1953) was criticized in "The Times" as "a children's classic vulgarized" with "Tinker Bell ... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".

Disney has been accused of <a href="antisemitism">anti-Semitism</a>, although none of his employeesincluding the animator <a href="Art%20Babbitt">Art Babbitt</a>, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts. The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons. Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named "1955 Man of the Year" by the <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith">B'nai B'rith</a> chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions. Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-Semitism and that Disney was "not [anti-Semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning some members of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Alliance%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20American%20Ideals">MPAPAI</a>], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life". Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.

Disney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material. The feature film "<a href="Song%20of%20the%20South">Song of the South</a>" was criticized by contemporary film critics, the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, and others for its perpetuation of <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20African%20Americans">black stereotypes</a>, but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, <a href="James%20Baskett">James Baskett</a>, the first black actor so honored. Gabler argues that "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive." <a href="Floyd%20Norman">Floyd Norman</a>, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, "Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of peopleand by this I mean all peoplecan only be called exemplary."

Watts argues that many of Disney's post World War II films "legislated a kind of cultural <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States." Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an "agent of manipulation and repression", although he observes that it has "labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy". John Tomlinson, in his study "Cultural Imperialism", examines the work of <a href="Ariel%20Dorfman">Ariel Dorfman</a> and <a href="Armand%20Mattelart">Armand Mattelart</a>, whose 1971 book (trans: "<a href="How%20to%20Read%20Donald%20Duck">How to Read Donald Duck</a>") identifies that there are "imperialist ... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome façade of the world of Walt Disney"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as "it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children." Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as "they simply "assume" that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent ... ['<a href="Yankee">Yankee</a>'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect".

Several commentators have described Disney as a <a href="cultural%20icon">cultural icon</a>. On Disney's death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those "considered valuable in American Christian society", which include "individualism, decency, ... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration". Disney's obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" calls the films "wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining ... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty". Journalist <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> argues that Disney's "achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history." Correspondent <a href="Alistair%20Cooke">Alistair Cooke</a> calls Disney a "folk-hero ... the Pied Piper of Hollywood", while Gabler considers Disney "reshaped the culture and the American consciousness". In the "American Dictionary of National Biography", Langer writes:

Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.

Warren G. Harding

Warren Gamaliel Harding (November 2, 1865 – August 2, 1923) was the 29th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from 1921 until his death in 1923, a member of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>. At that time, he was one of the most popular U.S. presidents, but the subsequent exposure of scandals that took place under his administration such as <a href="Teapot%20Dome%20scandal">Teapot Dome</a> eroded his popular regard, as did revelations of an affair by <a href="Nan%20Britton">Nan Britton</a>, one of his mistresses. In <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">historical rankings of the U.S. presidents</a>, Harding is often rated among the worst.

Harding lived in rural <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> all his life, except when political service took him elsewhere. As a young man, he bought "<a href="The%20Marion%20Star">The Marion Star</a>", building it into a successful newspaper. In 1899, he was elected to the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Senate">Ohio State Senate</a> and after four years there successfully ran for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Ohio">lieutenant governor</a>. He was defeated for governor in 1910, but was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in 1914. When Harding ran for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> nomination for president in 1920 he was considered a long shot until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General <a href="Leonard%20Wood">Leonard Wood</a>, could not gain the needed majority and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a>, remaining for the most part in Marion and allowing the people to come to him. Running on a theme of a <a href="return%20to%20normalcy">return to normalcy</a> of the pre-WWI period, he won in a landslide over Democrat <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a> and Socialist Party candidate <a href="Eugene%20Debs">Eugene Debs</a> and became the first sitting U.S. Senator to be elected president.

Harding appointed a number of well-regarded figures to his cabinet, including <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Treasury">Treasury</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> at <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">Commerce</a> and <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> at the <a href="State%20Department">State Department</a>. A major foreign policy achievement came with the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Conference">Washington Naval Conference</a> of 1921–1922, in which the world's major naval powers agreed on a naval limitations program that lasted a decade. Two members of his cabinet were implicated in separate incidents of corruption: <a href="Interior%20Secretary">Interior Secretary</a> <a href="Albert%20Fall">Albert Fall</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Harry%20Daugherty">Harry Daugherty</a>. The resulting scandals did not fully emerge until after Harding's death, nor did word of his extramarital affairs, and these issues greatly damaged his reputation after his death. Harding died of a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> in San Francisco while on a western speaking tour, and was succeeded by his vice president, <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

Harding was born on November 2, 1865, in <a href="Blooming%20Grove%2C%20Ohio">Blooming Grove, Ohio</a>. Nicknamed "Winnie" as a small child, Harding was the eldest of eight children born to <a href="George%20Tryon%20Harding">George Tryon Harding</a> (1843–1928; usually known as Tryon) and Phoebe Elizabeth (née Dickerson) Harding (1843–1910). Phoebe was a state-licensed midwife. Tryon farmed and taught school near <a href="Mount%20Gilead%2C%20Ohio">Mount Gilead, Ohio</a>. Through apprenticeship, study and a year of medical school, Tryon became a doctor and started a small practice. Some of Harding's mother's ancestors were Dutch, including the well-known Van Kirk family. Harding also had ancestors from England, Wales and Scotland.

It was rumored by a political opponent in Blooming Grove that one of Harding's great-grandmothers was <a href="African%20American">African American</a>. His great-great grandfather Amos Harding claimed that a thief, who had been caught in the act by the family, started the rumor in an attempt at extortion or revenge. In 2015, <a href="genetic%20testing">genetic testing</a> of Harding's descendants determined, with more than a 95% chance of accuracy, that he lacked sub-Saharan African forebears within four generations.

In 1870, the Harding family, who were <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionists</a>, moved to <a href="Caledonia%2C%20Ohio">Caledonia, Ohio</a>, where Tryon acquired "The Argus", a local weekly newspaper. At "The Argus", Harding, from the age of 11, learned the basics of the newspaper business.

In late 1879, at the age of 14, Harding enrolled at his father's "alma mater" – <a href="Ohio%20Central%20College">Ohio Central College</a> in <a href="Iberia%2C%20Ohio">Iberia</a> – where he proved an adept student. He and a friend put out a small newspaper, the "Iberia Spectator", during their final year at Ohio Central, intended to appeal to both college and town. During his final year, the Harding family moved to <a href="Marion%2C%20Ohio">Marion, Ohio</a>, about from Caledonia, and when he graduated in 1882, he joined them there.

In Harding's youth, the majority of the population still lived on farms and in small towns. He would spend much of his life in Marion, a small city in rural Ohio, and would become closely associated with it. When Harding rose to high office, he made clear his love of Marion and its way of life, telling of the many young Marionites who had left and enjoyed success elsewhere, while suggesting that the man, once the "pride of the school", who had remained behind and become a <a href="janitor">janitor</a>, was "the happiest one of the lot".

Upon graduating, Harding had stints as a teacher and as an insurance man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 () in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, "<a href="The%20Marion%20Star">The Marion Star</a>", weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the <a href="1884%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1884 Republican National Convention</a>, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion "Democratic Mirror" and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, who won <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">the election</a>. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.

Through the later years of the 1880s, Harding built the "Star". The city of Marion tended to vote Republican (as did Ohio), but <a href="Marion%20County%2C%20Ohio">Marion County</a> was Democratic. Accordingly, Harding adopted a tempered editorial stance, declaring the daily "Star" nonpartisan and circulating a weekly edition that was moderate Republican. This policy attracted advertisers and put the town's Republican weekly out of business. According to his biographer, Andrew Sinclair:

The population of Marion grew from 4,000 in 1880 to twice that in 1890, increasing to 12,000 by 1900. This growth helped the "Star", and Harding did his best to promote the city, purchasing stock in many local enterprises. Although a few of these turned out badly, he was in general successful as an investor, leaving an estate of $850,000 in 1923 (equivalent to $ million in ). According to Harding biographer and former <a href="White%20House%20Counsel">White House Counsel</a> <a href="John%20Dean">John Dean</a>, Harding's "civic influence was that of an activist who used his editorial page to effectively keep his nose—and a prodding voice—in all the town's public business". To date, Harding is the only U.S. president to have had <a href="journalism">journalism</a> experience. He became an ardent supporter of Governor <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a>, a Republican.

Harding first came to know <a href="Florence%20Harding">Florence Kling</a>, five years older than he, as the daughter of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.

A truce between the Klings was snuffed out by the budding match. Amos believed that the Hardings had African American blood, and was also offended by Harding's editorial stances. He started to spread rumors of Harding's supposed black heritage, and encouraged local businessmen to boycott Harding's business interests. When Harding found out what Kling was doing, he warned Kling "that he would beat the tar out of the little man if he didn't cease."

The Hardings were married on July 8, 1891, at their new home on Mount Vernon Avenue in Marion, which they had designed together in the <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne style</a>. The marriage produced no children. Harding affectionately called his wife "the Duchess" for a character in a serial from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Sun">The New York Sun</a>" who kept a close eye on "the Duke" and their money.

Florence Harding became deeply involved in her husband's career, both at the "Star" and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the "Star" into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; some have suggested that she pushed him all the way to the White House.

Soon after purchasing the "Star", Harding turned his attention to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">war</a> generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a>, but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican <a href="political%20convention">state convention</a> in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.

Harding's success as an editor took a toll on his health. Five times between 1889 (when he was 23) and 1901, he spent time at the <a href="Battle%20Creek%20Sanitorium">Battle Creek Sanitorium</a> for reasons Sinclair described as "fatigue, overstrain, and nervous illnesses". Dean ties these visits to early occurrences of the heart ailment that would kill Harding in 1923. During one such absence from Marion, in 1894, the "Star"'s business manager quit. Florence Harding took his place. She became her husband's top assistant at the "Star" on the business side, maintaining her role until the Hardings moved to Washington in 1915. Her competence allowed Harding to travel to make speecheshis use of the free railroad pass increased greatly after his marriage. Florence Harding practiced strict economy and wrote of Harding, "he does well when he listens to me and poorly when he does not."

In 1892, Harding traveled to Washington, where he met Democratic Nebraska Congressman <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, and listened to the "Boy Orator of the Platte" speak on the floor of the House of Representatives. Harding traveled to Chicago's <a href="Columbian%20Exposition">Columbian Exposition</a> in 1893. Both visits were without Florence. Democrats generally won Marion County's offices; when Harding ran for auditor in 1895, he lost, but did better than expected. The following year, Harding was one of many orators who spoke across Ohio as part of <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">the campaign</a> of the Republican presidential candidate, that state's former governor, <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. According to Dean, "while working for McKinley [Harding] began making a name for himself through Ohio".

Harding wished to try again for elective office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been careful to maintain good relations with the party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, McKinley's political manager and chairman of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.

Harding began his four years as a state senator as a political unknown; he ended them as one of the most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even as he passed them in his political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems. It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">assassination of McKinley</a> in September (he was succeeded by Vice President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.

Like most politicians of his time, Harding accepted that patronage and graft would be used to repay political favors. He arranged for his sister Mary (who was legally blind) to be appointed as a teacher at the <a href="Ohio%20School%20for%20the%20Blind">Ohio School for the Blind</a>, although there were better-qualified candidates. In another trade, he offered publicity in his newspaper in exchange for free railroad passes for himself and his family. According to Sinclair, "it is doubtful that Harding ever thought there was anything dishonest in accepting the perquisites of position or office. Patronage and favors seemed the normal reward for party service in the days of Hanna."

Soon after Harding's initial election as senator, he met <a href="Harry%20M.%20Daugherty">Harry M. Daugherty</a>, who would take a major role in his political career. A perennial candidate for office who served two terms in the state House of Representatives in the early 1890s, Daugherty had become a political fixer and lobbyist in the state capital of Columbus. After first meeting and talking with Harding, Daugherty commented, "Gee, what a great-looking President he'd make."

In early 1903, Harding announced he would run for <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Ohio">Governor of Ohio</a>, prompted by the withdrawal of the leading candidate, Congressman <a href="Charles%20Dick">Charles Dick</a>. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a> commenced, the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker <a href="Myron%20T.%20Herrick">Myron T. Herrick</a>, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor <a href="Tom%20L.%20Johnson">Tom L. Johnson</a>. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.

Once he and Harding were inaugurated, Herrick made ill-advised decisions that turned crucial Republican constituencies against him, alienating farmers by opposing the establishment of an agricultural college. On the other hand, according to Sinclair, "Harding had little to do, and he did it very well". His responsibility to preside over the state Senate allowed him to increase his growing network of political contacts. Harding and others envisioned a successful gubernatorial run in 1905, but Herrick refused to stand aside. In early 1905, Harding announced he would accept nomination as governor if offered, but faced with the anger of leaders such as Cox, Foraker and Dick (Hanna's replacement in the Senate), announced he would seek no office in 1905. Herrick was defeated, but his new running mate, <a href="Andrew%20L.%20Harris">Andrew L. Harris</a>, was elected, and succeeded as governor after five months in office on the death of Democrat <a href="John%20M.%20Pattison">John M. Pattison</a>. One Republican official wrote to Harding, "Aren't you sorry Dick wouldn't let you run for Lieutenant Governor?"

In addition to helping pick a president, Ohio voters in 1908 were to choose the legislators who would decide whether to re-elect Foraker. The senator had quarreled with President Roosevelt over the <a href="Brownsville%20Affair">Brownsville Affair</a>. Though Foraker had little chance of winning, he sought the Republican presidential nomination against his fellow Cincinnatian, Secretary of War <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, who was Roosevelt's chosen successor. On January 6, 1908, Harding's "Star" endorsed Foraker and upbraided Roosevelt for trying to destroy the senator's career over a matter of conscience. On January 22, Harding in the "Star" reversed course and declared for Taft, deeming Foraker defeated. According to Sinclair, Harding's change to Taft "was not ... because he saw the light but because he felt the heat". Jumping on the Taft <a href="bandwagon%20effect">bandwagon</a> allowed Harding to survive his patron's disaster—Foraker failed to gain the presidential nomination, and was defeated for a third term as senator. Also helpful in saving Harding's career was the fact that he was popular with, and had done favors for, the more progressive forces that now controlled the Ohio Republican Party.

Harding sought and gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, the party was deeply divided between progressive and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent <a href="Judson%20Harmon">Judson Harmon</a>. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.

The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The <a href="1912%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1912 Republican National Convention</a> was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave a speech nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not receptive to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, to be elected.

Congressman <a href="Theodore%20E.%20Burton">Theodore Burton</a> had been elected as senator in Foraker's place in 1909, and announced that he would seek a second term in the 1914 elections. By this time, the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> had been ratified, giving the people the right to elect senators, and Ohio had instituted primary elections for the office. Foraker and former congressman <a href="Ralph%20D.%20Cole">Ralph D. Cole</a> also entered the Republican primary. When Burton withdrew, Foraker became the favorite, but his Old Guard Republicanism was deemed outdated, and Harding was urged to enter the race. Daugherty claimed credit for persuading Harding to run, "I found him like a turtle sunning himself on a log, and I pushed him into the water." According to Harding biographer Randolph Downes, "he put on a campaign of such sweetness and light as would have won the plaudits of the angels. It was calculated to offend nobody except Democrats." Although Harding did not attack Foraker, his supporters had no such scruples. Harding won the primary by 12,000 votes over Foraker.

Harding's <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Ohio%2C%201914">general election</a> opponent was Ohio Attorney General <a href="Timothy%20Sylvester%20Hogan%20%28politician%29">Timothy Hogan</a>, who had risen to statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the prospect of a Catholic senator from Ohio increased <a href="nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like "The Menace" and "The Defender" contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope <a href="Benedict%20XV">Benedict XV</a> through the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.

Harding's <a href="wikt%3Aconciliatory">conciliatory</a> campaigning style aided him; one Harding friend deemed the candidate's <a href="stump%20speech%20%28politics%29">stump speech</a> during the 1914 fall campaign as "a rambling, high-sounding mixture of platitudes, patriotism, and pure nonsense". Dean notes, "Harding used his oratory to good effect; it got him elected, making as few enemies as possible in the process." Harding won by over 100,000 votes in a landslide that also swept into office a Republican governor, <a href="Frank%20B.%20Willis">Frank B. Willis</a>.

When Harding joined the U.S. Senate, the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, and were led by President Wilson. As a junior senator in the minority, Harding received unimportant committee assignments, but carried out those duties assiduously. He was a safe, conservative, Republican vote. As during his time in the Ohio Senate, Harding came to be widely liked.

On two issues, women's suffrage, and the prohibition of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated that he could not support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the <a href="Eighteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment</a>, which imposed <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the <a href="Volstead%20Act">Volstead Bill</a>, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the <a href="Anti-Saloon%20League">Anti-Saloon League</a>.

Harding, as a politician respected by both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the <a href="1916%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1916 Republican National Convention</a> and to deliver the <a href="keynote%20address">keynote address</a>. He urged delegates to stand as a united party. The convention nominated Justice <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president <a href="1916%20Progressive%20National%20Convention">declined the 1916 Progressive nomination</a>, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201916">November 1916 presidential election</a>, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.

Harding spoke and voted in favor of the resolution of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a>, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the <a href="excess%20profits%20tax">excess profits tax</a> as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.

In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held just before the armistice, Republicans narrowly took control of the Senate. Harding was appointed to the <a href="Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>. Wilson took no senators with him to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a>, confident that he could force what became the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> through the Senate by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the <a href="Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations">League Covenant</a>, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a <a href="Round-robin%20%28document%29">round-robin letter</a> opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated president in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.

With most Progressives having rejoined the Republican Party, their former leader, Theodore Roosevelt, was deemed likely to make a third run for the White House in 1920, and was the overwhelming favorite for the Republican nomination. These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6, 1919. A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General <a href="Leonard%20Wood">Leonard Wood</a>, Illinois Governor <a href="Frank%20Lowden">Frank Lowden</a>, California Senator <a href="Hiram%20Johnson">Hiram Johnson</a>, and a host of relatively minor possibilities such as <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, and General <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>.

Harding, while he wanted to be president, was as much motivated in entering the race by his desire to keep control of Ohio Republican politics, enabling his re-election to the Senate in 1920. Among those coveting Harding's seat were former governor Willis (he had been defeated by <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a> in 1916) and Colonel <a href="William%20Cooper%20Procter">William Cooper Procter</a> (head of <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>). On December 17, 1919, Harding made a low-key announcement of his presidential candidacy. Leading Republicans disliked Wood and Johnson, both of the progressive faction of the party, and Lowden, who had an independent streak, was deemed little better. Harding was far more acceptable to the "Old Guard" leaders of the party.

Daugherty, who became Harding's campaign manager, was sure none of the other candidates could garner a majority. His strategy was to make Harding an acceptable choice to delegates once the leaders faltered. Daugherty established a Harding for president campaign office in Washington (run by his confidant, <a href="Jess%20Smith">Jess Smith</a>), and worked to manage a network of Harding friends and supporters, including <a href="Frank%20Scobey">Frank Scobey</a> of Texas (clerk of the Ohio State Senate during Harding's years there). Harding worked to shore up his support through incessant letter-writing. Despite the candidate's work, according to Russell, "without Daugherty's <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistophelean</a> efforts, Harding would never have stumbled forward to the nomination."

There were only 16 presidential primary states in 1920, of which the most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the convention to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding out of the race by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the non-confrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give up and have Daugherty file his re-election papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand, "Warren Harding, what are you doing? Give up? Not until the convention is over. Think of your friends in Ohio!" On learning that Daugherty had left the phone line, the future First Lady retorted, "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this fight until Hell freezes over."

After he recovered from the shock of the poor results, Harding traveled to Boston, where he delivered a speech that according to Dean, "would resonate throughout the 1920 campaign and history." There, he stated that "America's present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration." Dean notes, "Harding, more than the other aspirants, was reading the nation's pulse correctly."

The <a href="1920%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1920 Republican National Convention</a> opened at the <a href="Chicago%20Coliseum%23The%20third%20Coliseum">Chicago Coliseum</a> on June 8, 1920, assembling delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over the results of a Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ), lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in the pockets of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000, and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.

Reporters deemed Harding unlikely to be nominated due to his poor showing in the primaries, and relegated him to a place among the <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a>s. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign, had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former Justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.

After the convention dealt with other matters, the nominations for president opened on the morning of Friday, June 11. Harding had asked Willis to place his name in nomination, and the former governor responded with a speech popular among the delegates, both for its folksiness and for its brevity in the intense Chicago heat. Reporter Mark Sullivan, who was present, called it a splendid combination of "oratory, grand opera, and <a href="hog%20calling">hog calling</a>." Willis confided, leaning over the podium railing, "Say, boys—and girls too—why not name Warren Harding?" The laughter and applause that followed created a warm feeling for Harding.

Four ballots were taken on the afternoon of June 11, and they revealed a deadlock. With 493 votes needed to nominate, Wood was the closest with 314; Lowdon had 289. The best Harding had done was 65. Chairman <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> of Massachusetts, the <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a>, adjourned the convention about 7 p.m.

The night of June 11–12, 1920, would become famous in political history as the night of the "<a href="smoke-filled%20room">smoke-filled room</a>," in which, legend has it, party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding. Historians have focused on the talks held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman <a href="Will%20H.%20Hays">Will Hays</a> at the <a href="Blackstone%20Hotel">Blackstone Hotel</a>, at which senators and others came and went, and numerous possible candidates were discussed. Utah Senator <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a>, before his departure early in the evening, backed Harding, telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were likely to nominate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio. Smoot also told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding, but that it would not be done for several ballots yet. This was not true: a number of participants backed Harding (others supported his rivals), but there was no pact to nominate him, and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement. Two other participants in the smoke-filled room discussions, Kansas Senator <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> and Colonel <a href="George%20Brinton%20McClellan%20Harvey">George Brinton McClellan Harvey</a>, a close friend of Hays, predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates.

Colonel Harvey's account of the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for in the early morning hours, to be informed by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.

The reassembled delegates had heard rumors that Harding was the choice of a cabal of senators. Although this was not true, delegates believed it, and sought a way out by voting for Harding. When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12, Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots, rising to 133 as the two front runners saw little change. Lodge then declared a three-hour recess, to the outrage of Daugherty, who raced to the podium, and confronted him, "You cannot defeat this man this way! The motion was not carried! You cannot defeat this man!" Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee, a scheme Hays refused to have anything to do with. The ninth ballot, after some initial suspense, saw delegation after delegation break for Harding, who took the lead with 374 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 for Lowden (Johnson had 83). Lowden released his delegates to Harding, and the tenth ballot, held at 6 p.m., was a mere formality, with Harding finishing with 672 votes to 156 for Wood. The nomination was made unanimous. The delegates, desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses, then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination. Harding wanted Senator <a href="Irvine%20Lenroot">Irvine Lenroot</a> of Wisconsin, who was unwilling to run, but before Lenroot's name could be withdrawn and another candidate decided on, an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge, which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates. Coolidge, popular for his role in breaking the <a href="Boston%20Police%20Strike">Boston police strike</a> of 1919, was nominated for vice president, receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had. James Morgan wrote in "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>": "The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday ... the President makers did not have a clean shirt. On such things, Rollo, turns the destiny of nations."

The Harding/Coolidge ticket was quickly backed by Republican newspapers, but those of other viewpoints expressed disappointment. The "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" found Harding the least-qualified candidate since <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, deeming the Ohio senator a "weak and mediocre" man who "never had an original idea." The <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst newspapers</a> called Harding "the flag-bearer of a new Senatorial autocracy." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the Republican presidential candidate as "a very respectable Ohio politician of the second class."

The <a href="1920%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> opened in San Francisco on June 28, 1920, under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson, who wished to be nominated for a third term. Delegates were convinced Wilson's health would not permit him to serve, and looked elsewhere for a candidate. Former Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a> was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination so long as the president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General <a href="A.%20Mitchell%20Palmer">A. Mitchell Palmer</a>. On the 44th ballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. As Cox was, when not in politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice. Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives, and were reluctant progressives at best.
Harding elected to conduct a <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a>, like McKinley in 1896. Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to resemble McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion, and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge spoke in the Northeast, later on in the South, and was not a significant factor in the election.

In Marion, Harding ran his campaign. As a newspaperman himself, he fell into easy camaraderie with the press covering him, enjoying a relationship few presidents have equaled. His "<a href="return%20to%20normalcy">return to normalcy</a>" theme was aided by the atmosphere that Marion provided, an orderly place that induced nostalgia in many voters. The front porch campaign allowed Harding to avoid mistakes, and as time dwindled towards the election, his strength grew. The travels of the Democratic candidates eventually caused Harding to make several short speaking tours, but for the most part, he remained in Marion. America had no need for another Wilson, Harding argued, appealing for a president "near the normal."
Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo described a typical Harding speech as "an army of pompous phrases moving over the landscape in search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> concurred, "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm ... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." "The New York Times" took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts."

Wilson had stated that the 1920 election would be a "great and solemn referendum" on the League of Nations, making it difficult for Cox to maneuver on the issue—although Roosevelt strongly supported the League, Cox was less enthusiastic. Harding opposed entry into the League of Nations as negotiated by Wilson, but favored an "association of nations," based on the <a href="Permanent%20Court%20of%20Arbitration">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> at <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>. This was general enough to satisfy most Republicans, and only a few bolted the party over this issue. By October, Cox had realized there was widespread public opposition to Article X, and stated that <a href="reservation%20%28law%29">reservations</a> to the treaty might be necessary; this shift allowed Harding to say no more on the subject.
The RNC hired <a href="Albert%20Lasker">Albert Lasker</a>, an advertising executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques for the first time in a presidential campaign. Lasker's approach included newsreels and sound recordings. Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. <a href="Telemarketers">Telemarketers</a> were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.

During the campaign, opponents spread old rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a <a href="West%20Indian">West Indian</a> <a href="black%20person">black person</a> and that other <a href="African-American%20heritage%20of%20United%20States%20presidents">blacks might be found in his family tree</a>. Harding's campaign manager rejected the accusations. <a href="Wooster%20College">Wooster College</a> professor <a href="William%20Estabrook%20Chancellor">William Estabrook Chancellor</a> publicized the rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.
By Election Day, November 2, 1920, few had any doubts that the Republican ticket would win. Harding received 60.2 percent of the popular vote, the highest percentage since the evolution of the <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a>, and 404 <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral votes</a>. Cox received 34 percent of the national vote and 127 electoral votes. Campaigning from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war, <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist</a> <a href="Eugene%20V.%20Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a> received 3 percent of the national vote. The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress.

Harding was sworn in March 4, 1921, in the presence of his wife and father. Harding preferred a low-key inauguration, without the customary parade, leaving only the swearing-in ceremony and a brief reception at the White House. In his inaugural address he declared, "Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much from the government and at the same time do too little for it."

After the election, Harding had announced he was going on vacation, and that no decisions about appointments would be made until he returned to Marion in December. He went to Texas, where he fished and played golf with his friend <a href="Frank%20Scobey">Frank Scobey</a> (soon to be <a href="Director%20of%20the%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>), then took ship for the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>. He went to Washington, where he was given a hero's welcome when Congress opened in early December as the first sitting senator to be elected to the White House. Back in Ohio, he planned to consult the "best minds" of the country on appointments, and they dutifully journeyed to Marion to offer their counsel.

Harding chose pro-League Charles Evans Hughes as his Secretary of State, ignoring advice from Senator Lodge and others. After <a href="Charles%20G.%20Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a> declined the Treasury position, Harding asked Pittsburgh banker <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a>, one of the richest people in the country; he agreed. Harding appointed Herbert Hoover as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">United States Secretary of Commerce</a>. RNC Chairman Will Hays was made <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a>, then a cabinet post; he would leave after a year in the position to become chief censor to the motion picture industry.

The two Harding cabinet appointees who darkened the reputation of his administration for their involvement in scandal were Harding's Senate friend, <a href="Albert%20B.%20Fall">Albert B. Fall</a> of New Mexico, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Interior Secretary</a>, and Daugherty, who became Attorney General. Fall was a Western rancher and former miner, and was pro-development. He was opposed by conservationists such as <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a>, who wrote, "it would have been possible to pick a worse man for Secretary of the Interior, but not altogether easy." "The New York Times" mocked the Daugherty appointment, stating that rather than select one of the best minds, Harding had been content "to choose merely a best friend." Eugene P. Trani and David L. Wilson, in their volume on Harding's presidency, suggest that the appointment made sense then, since Daugherty was "a competent lawyer well-acquainted with the seamy side of politics ... a first-class political troubleshooter and someone Harding could trust."

Harding made it clear when he appointed Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the <a href="Knox%E2%80%93Porter%20Resolution">Knox–Porter Resolution</a>, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93German%20Peace%20Treaty%20%281921%29">with Germany</a>, <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93Austrian%20Peace%20Treaty%20%281921%29">Austria</a> and <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93Hungarian%20Peace%20Treaty%20%281921%29">Hungary</a>, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.

This still left the question of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, or tried to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League, and though the U.S. refused to participate in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters.

By the time Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for reduction of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing the <a href="present%20value">present value</a> of the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the <a href="Dawes%20Plan">Dawes Plan</a> of 1924.

A pressing issue not resolved by Wilson was the question of policy towards <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russian SFSR</a>. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">famine struck Russia in 1921</a>, Hoover had the <a href="American%20Relief%20Administration">American Relief Administration</a>, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the <a href="U.S.S.R.">U.S.S.R.</a> was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.

Harding had urged disarmament and lower defense costs during the campaign, but it had not been a major issue. He gave a speech to a joint session of Congress in April 1921, setting out his legislative priorities. Among the few foreign policy matters he mentioned was disarmament, with the president stating that the government could not "be unmindful of the call for reduced expenditure" on defense.

Idaho Senator <a href="William%20Borah">William Borah</a> had proposed a conference at which the major naval powers, the U.S., Britain, and Japan, would agree to cuts in their fleets. Harding concurred, and after some diplomatic discussions, representatives of nine nations convened in Washington in November 1921. Most of the diplomats first attended <a href="Veterans%20Day">Armistice Day</a> ceremonies at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, where Harding spoke at the entombment of the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknowns">Unknown Soldier of World War I</a>, whose identity, "took flight with his imperishable soul. We know not whence he came, only that his death marks him with the everlasting glory of an American dying for his country".

Hughes, in his speech at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S. would decommission or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations on the use of poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the <a href="Senate%20Minority%20Leader">Senate Minority Leader</a>, Alabama's <a href="Oscar%20Underwood">Oscar Underwood</a>, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some.

The U.S. had acquired over a thousand vessels during World War I, and still owned most of them when Harding took office. Congress had authorized their disposal <a href="Merchant%20Marine%20Act%20of%201920">in 1920</a>, but the Senate would not confirm Wilson's nominees to the <a href="United%20States%20Shipping%20Board">Shipping Board</a>. Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman; the advertising executive undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold. Most ships proved impossible to sell at anything approaching the government's cost. Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the <a href="merchant%20marine">merchant marine</a> to enable the sales, and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it. Unpopular in the Midwest, the bill passed the House, but was defeated by a <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a> in the Senate, and most government ships were eventually scrapped.

Intervention in Latin America had been a minor campaign issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision to <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dominican%20Republic%20%281916%E2%80%9324%29">send U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic</a> and Haiti, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, for his role in the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Haiti">Haitian intervention</a>. Once Harding was sworn in, Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921; U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the <a href="Thomson%E2%80%93Urrutia%20Treaty">Thomson–Urrutia Treaty</a> with Colombia, granting that nation $25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) as settlement for the U.S.-provoked <a href="Separation%20of%20Panama%20from%20Colombia">Panamanian revolution of 1903</a>. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal, and to make it clear what the U.S. aims were.

The U.S. had intervened repeatedly in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Obreg%C3%B3n">Álvaro Obregón</a> wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, <a href="Bainbridge%20Colby">Bainbridge Colby</a>, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">1910 revolution</a> there. Obregón was unwilling to sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.

When Harding took office on March 4, 1921, the nation was in the midst of <a href="Depression%20of%201920%E2%80%9321">a postwar economic decline</a>. At the suggestion of its leaders, Harding called a special session of Congress to convene on April 11. When Harding addressed the joint session the following day, he urged the reduction of income taxes (raised during the war), an increase in tariffs on agricultural goods to protect the American farmer, as well as more wide-ranging reforms, such as support for highways, aviation, and radio. But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency tariff increase on agricultural products. <a href="Budget%20and%20Accounting%20Act%20of%201921">An act</a> authorizing a <a href="Bureau%20of%20the%20Budget">Bureau of the Budget</a> followed on June 10; Harding appointed Charles Dawes as bureau director with a mandate to cut expenditures.

Treasury Secretary Mellon also recommended to Congress that income tax rates be cut. He asked that the <a href="excess%20profits%20tax">excess profits tax</a> on corporations be abolished. The <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">House Ways and Means Committee</a> endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, "I can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem. I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House after the end of the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate to urge it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201921">the revenue bill</a> finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.
Harding had opposed payment of a bonus to veterans, arguing in his Senate address that much was already being done for them by a grateful nation, and that the bill would "break down our Treasury, from which so much is later on to be expected." The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee, but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921. A bill providing a bonus, without a means of funding it, was passed by both houses in September 1922. Harding vetoed it, and the veto was narrowly sustained. <a href="World%20War%20Adjusted%20Compensation%20Act">A bonus</a>, not payable in cash, was voted to soldiers despite Coolidge's veto in 1924.

In his first <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message to Congress</a>, Harding sought the power to adjust tariff rates. The passage of the tariff bill in the Senate, and in <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a> became a feeding frenzy of lobbyist interests. Harding, when he enacted the <a href="Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber%20Tariff">Fordney–McCumber Tariff</a> Act on September 21, 1922, made a brief <a href="signing%20statement">signing statement</a>, praising only that the bill gave him some power to adjust rates. According to Trani and Wilson, the bill was "ill-considered. It wrought havoc in international commerce and made the repayment of war debts more difficult."

Mellon ordered a study that demonstrated historically that, as income tax rates were increased, money was driven underground or abroad. He concluded that lower rates would increase tax revenues. Based on his advice, Harding's revenue bill cut taxes, starting in 1922. The top marginal rate was reduced annually in four stages from 73% in 1921 to 25% in 1925. Taxes were cut for lower incomes starting in 1923. The lower rates substantially increased the money flowing to the treasury. They also pushed massive deregulation and federal spending as a share of GDP fell from 6.5% to 3.5%. By late 1922, the economy began to turn around. Unemployment was pared from its 1921 high of 12% to an average of 3.3% for the remainder of the decade. The misery index, which is a combination of unemployment and inflation, had its sharpest decline in U.S. history under Harding. Wages, profits, and productivity all made substantial gains; annual GDP increases averaged at over 5% during the 1920s. Libertarian historians Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen argue that, "Mellon's tax policies set the stage for the most amazing growth yet seen in America's already impressive economy."

The 1920s were a time of modernization for America. Use of electricity became increasingly common. Mass production of the motor car stimulated other industries, as well, such as highway construction, rubber, steel, and building, as hotels were erected to accommodate the tourists venturing upon the roads. This economic boost helped bring the nation out of the recession. To improve and expand the nation's highway system, Harding signed the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201921%20%28Phipps%20Act%29">Federal Highway Act of 1921</a>. From 1921 to 1923, the federal government spent $162 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) on America's highway system, infusing the U.S. economy with a large amount of capital. In 1922, Harding proclaimed that America was in the age of the "motor car", which "reflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present-day life."

Harding had urged regulation of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover took charge of this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, which led to a voluntary agreement for licensing of <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequencies</a> through the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">Commerce Department</a>. Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.

Harding also wished to promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, convening a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation but nothing was done until 1926, when the <a href="Air%20Commerce%20Act%20of%201926">Air Commerce Act</a> created the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> within Hoover's Commerce Department.

Harding's attitude toward business was that government should aid it as much as possible. He was suspicious of <a href="organized%20labor">organized labor</a>, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some <a href="public%20works">public works</a> projects were accelerated.

Within broad limits, Harding allowed each cabinet secretary to run his department as he saw fit. Hoover expanded the Commerce Department to make it more useful to business. This was consistent with Hoover's view that the private sector should take the lead in managing the economy. Harding greatly respected his Commerce Secretary, often asked his advice, and backed him to the hilt, calling Hoover "the smartest '<a href="wikt%3Agink">gink</a>' I know".

Widespread strikes marked 1922, as labor sought redress for falling wages and increased unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by <a href="John%20L.%20Lewis">John L. Lewis</a>, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives argued that the industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of trying to break the union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.

On July 1, 1922, 400,000 railroad workers went on strike. Harding proposed a settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge <a href="James%20H.%20Wilkerson">James H. Wilkerson</a> to issue a sweeping injunction to break the strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.

By 1922, the <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour day</a> had become common in American industry. One exception was in <a href="steel%20mill">steel mill</a>s, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, seven days a week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers with a view to ending the system. The conference established a committee under the leadership of <a href="U.%20S.%20Steel">U. S. Steel</a> chairman <a href="Elbert%20Gary">Elbert Gary</a>, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.

Although Harding's first address to Congress called for passage of anti-lynching legislation, he initially seemed inclined to do no more for African Americans than Republican presidents of the recent past had; he asked Cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments. Sinclair suggested that the fact that Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>s for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. "Whether you like it or not," Harding told his segregated audience, "unless our democracy is a lie, you must stand for that equality." The white section of the audience listened in silence, while the black section cheered.
Harding had spoken out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress, and supported Congressman <a href="Leonidas%20Dyer">Leonidas Dyer</a>'s <a href="Dyer%20Anti-Lynching%20Bill">federal anti-lynching bill</a>, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When it reached the Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.

With the public suspicious of immigrants, especially those who might be <a href="socialist">socialist</a>s or <a href="communist">communist</a>s, Congress passed the <a href="Emergency%20Quota%20Act">Per Centum Act of 1921</a>, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, as a quick means of restricting immigration. The act reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3% of those from a given country living in the U.S., based on the 1910 census. This would, in practice, not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany, but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews. Harding and Secretary of Labor <a href="James%20J.%20Davis">James Davis</a> believed that enforcement had to be humane, and at the Secretary's recommendation, Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable immigrants to remain. In 1924, Coolidge signed the <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201924">Immigration Act of 1924</a>, permanently restricting immigration to the U.S.

Harding's Socialist opponent in the 1920 election, <a href="Eugene%20Debs">Eugene Debs</a>, was serving a ten-year sentence in the <a href="Atlanta%20Penitentiary">Atlanta Penitentiary</a> for speaking against the war. Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed, commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.

Harding released 23 other war opponents at the same time as Debs, and continued to review cases and release political prisoners throughout his presidency. Harding defended his prisoner releases as necessary to return the nation to normalcy.

Harding appointed four justices to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. When Chief Justice <a href="Edward%20Douglass%20White">Edward Douglass White</a> died in May 1921, Harding was unsure whether to appoint former president Taft or former Utah senator <a href="George%20Sutherland">George Sutherland</a>—he had promised seats on the court to both men. After briefly considering awaiting another vacancy and appointing them both, he chose Taft as Chief Justice. Sutherland was appointed to the court in 1922, to be followed by two other economic conservatives, <a href="Pierce%20Butler%20%28justice%29">Pierce Butler</a> and <a href="Edward%20Terry%20Sanford">Edward Terry Sanford</a>, in 1923.

Harding also appointed six judges to the <a href="United%20States%20Courts%20of%20Appeals">United States Courts of Appeals</a>, 42 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20courts">United States district courts</a>, and two judges to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Customs%20Appeals">United States Court of Customs Appeals</a>.

Entering the 1922 midterm congressional election campaign, Harding and the Republicans had followed through on many of their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11 percent, and organized labor angry over the outcome of the strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new <a href="68th%20United%20States%20Congress">68th Congress</a> would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.

A month after the election, the <a href="lame-duck%20session">lame-duck session</a> of the old <a href="67th%20United%20States%20Congress">67th Congress</a> met. Harding had come to believe that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, although in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able Cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.

In the first half of 1923, Harding did two acts that were later said to indicate foreknowledge of death: he sold the "Star" (though undertaking to remain as a contributing editor for ten years after his presidency), and made a new will. Harding had long suffered occasional health problems, but when he was not experiencing symptoms, he tended to eat, drink and smoke too much. By 1919, he was aware he had a heart condition. Stress caused by the presidency and by Florence Harding's ill-health (she had a chronic kidney condition) debilitated him, and he never really recovered from an episode of influenza in January 1923. After that, Harding, an avid golfer, had difficulty completing a round. In June 1923, Ohio Senator Willis met with Harding, but brought to the president's attention only two of the five items he intended to discuss. When asked why, Willis responded, "Warren seemed so tired."

In early June 1923, Harding set out on a journey, which he dubbed the "Voyage of Understanding." The president planned to cross the country, go north to <a href="Alaska%20Territory">Alaska Territory</a>, journey south along the West Coast, then travel by a US Navy ship from San Diego along the Mexican and Central America West Coast, through the Panama Canal, to Puerto Rico, and to return to Washington at the end of August. Harding loved to travel and had long contemplated a trip to Alaska. The trip would allow him to speak widely across the country, to politic and <a href="bloviation">bloviate</a> in advance of the 1924 campaign, and allow him some rest away from Washington's oppressive summer heat.

Harding's political advisers had given him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in <a href="Hutchinson%2C%20Kansas">Hutchinson, Kansas</a>, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the <a href="Permanent%20Court%20of%20International%20Justice">World Court</a>, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a> and <a href="Zion%20National%20Park">Zion National Park</a>s, and dedicated a monument on the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer <a href="Ezra%20Meeker">Ezra Meeker</a> and others.

On July 5, Harding embarked on in Washington state. The first president to visit Alaska, he spent hours watching the dramatic landscapes from the deck of the "Henderson". After several stops along the coast, the presidential party left the ship at <a href="Seward%2C%20Alaska">Seward</a> to take the <a href="Alaska%20Railroad">Alaska Central Railway</a> to <a href="McKinley%20Park%2C%20Alaska">McKinley Park</a> and <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>, where he addressed a crowd of 1,500 in heat. The party was to return to Seward by the <a href="Richardson%20Highway">Richardson Trail</a>, but due to Harding's fatigue, it went by train.

On July 26, 1923, Harding toured <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> as the first sitting American president to visit Canada. He was welcomed by the Premier of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> and the Mayor of Vancouver, and spoke to a crowd of over 50,000. Two years after his death, a memorial to Harding was unveiled in <a href="Stanley%20Park">Stanley Park</a>. Harding visited a golf course, but completed only six holes before being fatigued. After resting, he played the 17th and 18th holes so it would appear he had completed the round. He was not successful in hiding his exhaustion; one reporter deemed him looking so tired that a rest of mere days would not be sufficient to refresh him.

In Seattle the next day, Harding kept up his busy schedule, giving a speech to 25,000 people at <a href="Husky%20Stadium">the stadium</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>. In the final speech he gave, Harding predicted statehood for Alaska. The president rushed through his speech, not waiting for applause by the audience.

Harding went to bed early on the evening of July 27, 1923, a few hours after giving his final speech at the University of Washington. Later that night, he called for his physician, <a href="Charles%20E.%20Sawyer">Charles E. Sawyer</a>, complaining of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. <a href="Joel%20T.%20Boone">Joel T. Boone</a> suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29 he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the <a href="Palace%20Hotel%2C%20San%20Francisco">Palace Hotel</a> where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Harding was then confined to bed rest in his hotel room for the remainder of the time. When treated with caffeine and <a href="Digoxin">digitalis</a>, Harding seemed to improve, and he was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2 doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, at about 7:30 pm, he was listening to Florence read him a flattering article about him from "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", "A Calm Review of a Calm Man." When she paused to fluff his pillows Harding said: "That's good, read some more". As Florence resumed reading Harding suddenly twisted convulsively and collapsed back in the bed; doctors were unable to revive him with stimulants. His death was initially attributed to a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a>, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a>.
Harding's death came as a great shock to the nation. The president was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding's body was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., where he <a href="lying%20in%20state%23United%20States">lay in state</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">United States Capitol rotunda</a>. After funeral services there, the body was transported to Marion, Ohio, for burial.

In Marion, Harding's body was placed on a horse-drawn <a href="hearse">hearse</a>, which was followed by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's widow and father. They followed it through the city, past the "Star" building, and finally to the Marion Cemetery, where the casket was placed in the <a href="Marion%20Cemetery%20Receiving%20Vault">cemetery's receiving vault</a>. Attendees at Harding's funeral included such friends as inventor <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and industrialist businessmen <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> and <a href="Harvey%20S.%20Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a>. Warren and Florence Harding rest in the <a href="Harding%20Tomb">Harding Tomb</a>, which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover.

Harding appointed a number of friends and acquaintances to federal positions. Some served competently, such as <a href="Charles%20E.%20Sawyer">Charles E. Sawyer</a>, the Hardings' personal physician from Marion who attended to them in the White House. Sawyer alerted Harding to the Veterans' Bureau scandal. Others proved ineffective in office, such as <a href="Daniel%20R.%20Crissinger">Daniel R. Crissinger</a>, a Marion lawyer whom Harding made <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Currency">Comptroller of the Currency</a> and later a governor of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Board">Federal Reserve Board</a>; or Harding's old friend Frank Scobey, Director of the Mint, who Trani and Wilson noted "did little damage during his tenure." Harding's brother-in-law Heber H. Votaw, superintendent of federal prisons, was unable to root out the drug trade from within the facilities. Others of these associates proved corrupt and were later dubbed the "<a href="Ohio%20Gang">Ohio Gang</a>".
Most of the scandals that have marred the reputation of Harding's administration did not emerge until after his death. The Veterans' Bureau scandal was known to Harding in January 1923 but, according to Trani and Wilson, "the president's handling of it did him little credit". Harding allowed the corrupt director of the bureau, <a href="Charles%20R.%20Forbes">Charles R. Forbes</a>, to flee to Europe, though he later returned and served prison time. Harding had learned that Daugherty's factotum at the Justice Department, <a href="Jess%20Smith">Jess Smith</a>, was involved in corruption. The president ordered Daugherty to get Smith out of Washington and removed his name from the upcoming presidential trip to Alaska. Smith committed suicide on May 30, 1923. It is uncertain how much Harding knew about Smith's illicit activities. Murray noted that Harding was not involved in the corruption and did not condone it.

Hoover accompanied Harding on the Western trip and later wrote that Harding asked then what Hoover would do if he knew of some great scandal, whether to publicize it or bury it. Hoover replied that Harding should publish and get credit for integrity, and asked for details. Harding stated that it had to do with Smith but, when Hoover enquired as to Daugherty's possible involvement, Harding refused to answer.

The scandal which has likely done the greatest damage to Harding's reputation is <a href="Teapot%20Dome%20scandal">Teapot Dome</a>. Like most of the administration's scandals, it came to public light after Harding's death, and he was not aware of the illegal aspects. Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside for the use of the Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary <a href="Franklin%20Knight%20Lane">Franklin Knight Lane</a> was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior. This was done with the consent of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Secretary</a> <a href="Edwin%20C.%20Denby">Edwin C. Denby</a>.

The Interior Department announced in July 1921 that <a href="Edward%20Doheny">Edward Doheny</a> had been awarded a lease to drill along the edges of the <a href="Elk%20Hills%20Oil%20Field">Elk Hills</a> naval reserve in California. The announcement attracted little controversy, as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjacent private land. Wyoming Senator <a href="John%20B.%20Kendrick">John Kendrick</a> had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased, but no announcement had been made. The Interior Department refused to provide documentation, so he secured the passage of a Senate resolution compelling disclosure. The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to <a href="Harry%20Ford%20Sinclair">Harry Sinclair</a>'s <a href="Mammoth%20Oil%20Company">Mammoth Oil Company</a>, along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involved—Mammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal. This satisfied some people, but some conservationists, such as <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a>, <a href="Harry%20A.%20Slattery">Harry A. Slattery</a>, and others, pushed for a full investigation into Fall and his activities. They got Wisconsin Senator <a href="Robert%20M.%20La%20Follette%20Sr.">Robert M. La Follette Sr.</a> to begin a Senate investigation into the oil leases. La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Walsh">Thomas J. Walsh</a> to lead the investigation, and Walsh read through the truckload of material provided by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval.

Hearings into Teapot Dome began in October 1923, two months after Harding's death. Fall had left office earlier that year, but he denied receiving any money from Sinclair or Doheny; Sinclair agreed. The following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared and stated that the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" publisher <a href="Edward%20B.%20McLean">Edward B. McLean</a>, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall <a href="Taking%20the%20Fifth">invoked his Fifth Amendment</a> right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.

Investigators found that Fall and a relative had received a total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was convicted in 1929 of accepting bribes, and in 1931 became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed in office. Sinclair was convicted only of <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a> for <a href="jury%20tampering">jury tampering</a>. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.

Harding's appointment of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers were not considered to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted at the prospect of connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.

Democratic Montana Senator <a href="Burton%20K.%20Wheeler">Burton K. Wheeler</a> was on the investigating committee and assumed the role of prosecutor when hearings began on March 12, 1924. Jess Smith had engaged in <a href="influence%20peddling">influence peddling</a> before his suicide, conspiring with two other Ohioans, Howard Mannington and Fred A. Caskey, to accept payoffs from <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">alcohol bootleggers</a> to secure either immunity from prosecution or the release of liquor from government warehouses. Mannington and Caskey's residence became infamous as the <a href="Little%20Green%20House%20on%20K%20Street">Little Green House on K Street</a>. Some witnesses, such as Smith's divorced wife Roxy Stinson, and corrupt former <a href="FBI">FBI</a> agent <a href="Gaston%20Means">Gaston Means</a>, alleged that Daugherty was personally involved. Coolidge requested Daugherty's resignation when the Attorney General indicated that he would not allow Wheeler's committee access to Justice Department records, and Daugherty complied on March 28, 1924.

The illicit activity that caused Daugherty the most problems was a Smith deal with Colonel <a href="Thomas%20W.%20Miller">Thomas W. Miller</a>, a former Delaware congressman, whom Harding had appointed <a href="Alien%20Property%20Custodian">Alien Property Custodian</a>. Smith and Miller received a payoff of almost half a million dollars for getting a German-owned firm, the American Metal Company, released to new U.S. owners. Smith deposited $50,000 in a <a href="joint%20account">joint account</a> with Daugherty, used for political purposes. Records relating to that account were destroyed by Daugherty and his brother. Miller and Daugherty were indicted for defrauding the government. The first trial, in September 1926, resulted in a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a>; at the second, early in 1927, Miller was convicted and served prison time, but the jury again hung as to Daugherty. Though charges against Daugherty were then dropped, and he was never convicted of any offense, his refusal to take the stand in his own defense devastated what was left of his reputation. The former Attorney General remained defiant, blaming his troubles on his enemies in the labor movement and on the Communists, and wrote that he had "done nothing that prevents my looking the whole world in the face".

<a href="Charles%20R.%20Forbes">Charles R. Forbes</a>, the energetic director of the Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built around the country to help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.

Near the beginning of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was set aside for the conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.

Intent on making more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling valuable hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies during the first World War, which Forbes unloaded for a fraction of their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly at a time when the Veterans' Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price.

The check on Forbes' authority at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician and chairman of the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.

Mortimer was willing to tell all, as Forbes had had an affair with his wife (which also broke up the Forbes marriage). The construction executive was the star witness at the hearings in late 1923, after Harding's death. Forbes returned from Europe to testify, but convinced few, and in 1924, he and John W. Thompson, of Thompson–Black, were tried in Chicago for conspiracy to defraud the government. Both were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Forbes began to serve his sentence in 1926; Thompson, who had a bad heart, died that year before commencing his. According to Trani and Wilson, "One of the most troublesome aspects of the Harding presidency was that he appeared to be far more concerned with political liabilities of a scandal than in securing justice."

Harding had an extramarital affair with <a href="Carrie%20Fulton%20Phillips">Carrie Fulton Phillips</a> of Marion, which lasted about fifteen years before ending in 1920. Letters from Harding to Phillips were discovered by Harding biographer <a href="Francis%20Russell%20%28author%29">Francis Russell</a> in the possession of Marion attorney Donald Williamson while Russell was researching his book in 1963. Before that, the affair was not generally known. Williamson donated the letters to the <a href="Ohio%20Historical%20Society">Ohio Historical Society</a>. Some there wanted the letters destroyed to preserve what remained of Harding's reputation. A lawsuit ensued, with Harding's heirs claiming copyright over the letters. The case was ultimately settled in 1971, with the letters donated to the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. They were sealed until 2014, but before their opening, historians used copies at <a href="Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University">Case Western Reserve University</a> and in Russell's papers at the <a href="University%20of%20Wyoming">University of Wyoming</a>. Russell concluded from the letters that Phillips was the love of Harding's life—"the enticements of his mind and body combined in one person", but historian Justin P. Coffey in his 2014 review of Harding biographies criticizes him for "obsess[ing] over Harding's sex life".

The allegations of Harding's other known mistress, <a href="Nan%20Britton">Nan Britton</a>, long remained uncertain. In 1927, Britton, also a Marionite, published "<a href="The%20President%27s%20Daughter%20%281928%20book%29">The President's Daughter</a>", alleging that her child <a href="Elizabeth%20Ann%20Blaesing">Elizabeth Ann Blaesing</a> had been fathered by Harding. The book, which was dedicated to "all unwedded mothers" and "their innocent children whose fathers are usually not known to the world", was sold, like pornography, door-to-door wrapped in brown paper. The late president's reputation had deteriorated since his death in 1923, and many believed Britton. The public was tantalized by salacious details such as Britton's claim that the two had sex in a White House closet, with <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> agents posted to ward off intruders. Although part of the public believed her, a jury found against her when she alleged she was libeled by a refutation of her book. According to Harding family lore, the late president was infertile and could not have fathered a child, having suffered from <a href="mumps">mumps</a> in childhood; Britton maintained that Harding had provided child support of $500 per month for the daughter he never met, but she had destroyed romantic correspondence from him at his request.

Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's allegations remained uncertain, differed on their truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, regarded them as unproven. In 2015, DNA comparisons between members of the Harding and Blaesing families conducted by <a href="ancestry.com">ancestry.com</a> indicated that Harding was Elizabeth's father. Sinclair wondered why Harding's infidelity was held so much against him, given that <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> was elected president in 1884 although it was known he had a mistress and may have fathered a son out of wedlock.

Upon his death, Harding was deeply mourned. He was called a man of peace in many European newspapers; American journalists praised him lavishly, with some describing him as having given his life for his country. His associates were stunned by his demise; Daugherty wrote, "I can hardly write about it or allow myself to think about it yet." Hughes stated, "I cannot realize that our beloved Chief is no longer with us."

<a href="Hagiography">Hagiographic</a> accounts of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's "Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President" (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration soon became a byword for corruption in the view of the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: "Masks in a Pageant", by <a href="William%20Allen%20White">William Allen White</a>, mocked and dismissed Harding, as did <a href="Samuel%20Hopkins%20Adams">Samuel Hopkins Adams</a>' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, "Revelry". These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.

Adams continued to shape the negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s, culminating with "The Incredible Era—The Life and Times of Warren G. Harding" (1939) in which he called his subject "an amiable, well-meaning third-rate <a href="Babbitt%20%28novel%29">Mr. Babbitt</a>, with the equipment of a small-town semi-educated journalist ... It could not work. It did not work." Dean deems the works of White and Adams "remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts, exaggerating the negative, assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs, and denying him credit for anything done right. Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding. Yet the myth has persisted."
The opening of Harding's papers for research in 1964 sparked a small spate of biographies, of which the most controversial was Russell's "The Shadow of Blooming Grove" (1968), which concluded that the rumors of black ancestry (the "shadow" of the title) deeply affected Harding in his formative years, causing both Harding's conservatism and his desire to get along with everyone. Coffey faults Russell's methods, and deems the biography "largely critical, though not entirely unsympathetic." Murray's "The Harding Era" (1969) took a more positive view of the president, and put him in the context of his times. Trani and Wilson faulted Murray for "a tendency to go overboard" in trying to connect Harding with the successful policies of cabinet officers, and for asserting, without sufficient evidence, that a new, more assertive Harding had emerged by 1923.
Later decades saw revisionist books published on Harding. <a href="Robert%20Hugh%20Ferrell">Robert Ferrell</a>'s "The Strange Deaths of President Harding" (1996), according to Coffey, "spends almost the entire work challenging every story about Harding and concludes that almost everything that is read and taught about his subject is wrong." In 2004, John Dean, noted for his involvement in another presidential scandal, <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate</a>, wrote the Harding volume in "The American Presidents" series of short biographies, edited by <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.</a>, Coffey deemed that book the most revisionist to date, and faults Dean for glossing over some unfavorable episodes in Harding's life, like his silence during the 1914 Senate campaign, when his opponent Hogan was being attacked for his faith.

Harding has traditionally been <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">ranked as one of the worst presidents</a>. In a 1948 poll conducted by <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, historian <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Sr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.</a> conducted the first notable survey of scholars' opinions of the presidents, Harding ranked last among the 29 presidents considered. He has also been last in other polls since, which Ferrell attributes to scholars reading little but sensational accounts of Harding. Murray argued that Harding deserves more credit than historians have given: "He was certainly the equal of a <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, an <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, a <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, or even a Calvin Coolidge. In concrete accomplishments, his administration was superior to a sizable portion of those in the nation's history." Coffey believes "the academic lack of interest in Harding has cost him his reputation, as scholars still rank Harding as nearly dead last among presidents."

Trani faults Harding's own lack of depth and decisiveness as bringing about his tarnished legacy. Still, modern authors and historians continue to call for a reconsideration of Harding's presidency. Murray argued that Harding sowed the seeds for his administration's poor standing:

William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian <a href="speculative%20fiction">speculative fiction</a> writer and <a href="essayist">essayist</a> widely credited with pioneering the <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> subgenre known as <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>. Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were <a href="noir%20fiction">noir</a>, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, and <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>s on humans—a "combination of <a href="low-life">lowlife</a> and <a href="high%20tech">high tech</a>"—and helped to create an <a href="iconography">iconography</a> for the <a href="information%20age">information age</a> before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson notably coined the term "<a href="cyberspace">cyberspace</a>" in his short story "<a href="Burning%20Chrome">Burning Chrome</a>" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>" (1984). These early works have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature.

After expanding on "Neuromancer" with two more novels to complete the <a href="dystopic">dystopic</a> <a href="Sprawl%20trilogy">Sprawl trilogy</a>, Gibson collaborated with <a href="Bruce%20Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a> on the <a href="alternate%20history">alternate history</a> novel "<a href="The%20Difference%20Engine">The Difference Engine</a>" (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a>. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the <a href="Bridge%20trilogy">Bridge trilogy</a> of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, <a href="postindustrial%20society">postindustrial society</a>, and <a href="late%20capitalism">late capitalism</a>. Following the turn of the century and the events of <a href="9/11">9/11</a>, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly <a href="Literary%20realism">realist</a> novels—"<a href="Pattern%20Recognition%20%28novel%29">Pattern Recognition</a>" (2003), "<a href="Spook%20Country">Spook Country</a>" (2007), and "<a href="Zero%20History">Zero History</a>" (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, "<a href="The%20Peripheral">The Peripheral</a>" (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.

In 1999, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described Gibson as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades," while the "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>" called him the "noir prophet" of cyberpunk. Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 10 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians. His work has been cited as an influence across a variety of disciplines spanning academia, design, film, literature, music, <a href="cyberculture">cyberculture</a>, and technology.

William Ford Gibson was born in the coastal city of <a href="Conway%2C%20South%20Carolina">Conway, South Carolina</a>, and he spent most of his childhood in <a href="Wytheville%2C%20Virginia">Wytheville, Virginia</a>, a small town in the <a href="Appalachians">Appalachians</a> where his parents had been born and raised. His family moved frequently during Gibson's youth owing to his father's position as manager of a large construction company. In <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, Gibson attended Pines Elementary School, where the teachers' lack of encouragement for him to read was a cause of dismay for his parents. While Gibson was still a young child, a little over a year into his stay at Pines Elementary, his father choked to death in a restaurant while on a business trip. His mother, unable to tell William the bad news, had someone else inform him of the death. <a href="Tom%20Maddox">Tom Maddox</a> has commented that Gibson "grew up in an America as disturbing and surreal as anything <a href="J.%20G.%20Ballard">J. G. Ballard</a> ever dreamed".

A few days after the death, Gibson's mother returned them from their home in Norfolk to Wytheville. Gibson later described Wytheville as "a place where <a href="modernity">modernity</a> had arrived to some extent but was deeply distrusted" and credits the beginnings of his relationship with science fiction, his "native literary culture", with the subsequent feeling of abrupt exile. At the age of 12, Gibson "wanted nothing more than to be a science fiction writer". He spent a few unproductive years at basketball-obsessed George Wythe High School, a time spent largely in his room listening to records and reading books. At 13, unbeknownst to his mother, he purchased an anthology of <a href="Beat%20generation">Beat generation</a> writing, thereby gaining exposure to the writings of <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, and <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>; the lattermost had a particularly pronounced effect, greatly altering Gibson's notions of the possibilities of science fiction literature.

A shy, ungainly teenager, Gibson grew up in a monoculture he found "highly problematic", consciously rejected religion and took refuge in reading science fiction as well as writers such as Burroughs and <a href="Henry%20Miller">Henry Miller</a>. Becoming frustrated with his poor academic performance, Gibson's mother threatened to send him to a boarding school; to her surprise, he reacted enthusiastically. Unable to afford his preferred choice of Southern California, his then "chronically anxious and <a href="clinical%20depression">depressive</a>" mother, who had remained in Wytheville since the death of her husband, sent him to Southern Arizona School for Boys in Tucson. He resented the structure of the private boarding school but was in retrospect grateful for its forcing him to engage socially. On the <a href="SAT">SAT</a> (Scholastic Aptitude Test) exams, he scored 148 out of 150 in the written section but 5 out of 150 in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, to the consternation of his teachers.

After his mother's death when he was 18, Gibson left school without graduating and became very isolated for a long time, traveling to California and Europe, and immersing himself in the <a href="counterculture">counterculture</a>. In 1967, he elected to move to Canada in order "to <a href="Draft%20dodger%23Vietnam%20War">avoid the Vietnam war draft</a>". At his draft hearing, he honestly informed interviewers that his intention in life was to sample every <a href="mind-altering%20substance">mind-altering substance</a> in existence. Gibson has observed that he "did not literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me"; after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left a week or two later. In the biographical documentary "<a href="No%20Maps%20for%20These%20Territories">No Maps for These Territories</a>" (2000), Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by <a href="conscientious%20objection">conscientious objection</a> than by a desire to "sleep with hippie chicks" and indulge in <a href="hashish">hashish</a>. He elaborated on the topic in a 2008 interview:

After weeks of nominal homelessness, Gibson was hired as the manager of Toronto's first <a href="head%20shop">head shop</a>, a retailer of drug paraphernalia. He found the city's émigré community of American draft dodgers unbearable owing to the prevalence of clinical depression, suicide, and hardcore substance abuse. He appeared, during the <a href="Summer%20of%20Love">Summer of Love</a> of 1967, in a <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">CBC</a> newsreel item about hippie <a href="subculture">subculture</a> in <a href="Yorkville%2C%20Toronto">Yorkville, Toronto</a>, for which he was paid $500 – the equivalent of 20 weeks rent – which financed his later travels. Aside from a "brief, riot-torn spell" in the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>, Gibson spent the rest of the 1960s in Toronto, where he met Vancouverite Deborah Jean Thompson, with whom he subsequently traveled to Europe. Gibson has recounted that they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and favorable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> in 1970, as they "couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had anything remotely like hard currency".

The couple married and settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's teaching salary. During the 1970s, Gibson made a substantial part of his living from scouring <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> thrift stores for underpriced artifacts he would then up-market to specialist dealers. Realizing that it was easier to sustain high college grades, and thus qualify for generous student financial aid, than to work, he enrolled at the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> (UBC), earning "a desultory bachelor's degree in English" in 1977. Through studying <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a>, he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of <a href="postmodernity">postmodernity</a>. It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, taught by <a href="Susan%20Wood%20%28science%20fiction%29">Susan Wood</a>, at the end of which he was encouraged to write his first short story, "<a href="Fragments%20of%20a%20Hologram%20Rose">Fragments of a Hologram Rose</a>".

After considering pursuing a master's degree on the topic of <a href="hard%20science%20fiction">hard science fiction</a> novels as <a href="Fascist%20%28epithet%29">fascist</a> literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a <a href="science%20fiction%20convention">science fiction convention</a> in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author <a href="John%20Shirley">John Shirley</a>. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.

Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors <a href="Bruce%20Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a> and <a href="Lewis%20Shiner">Lewis Shiner</a>; reading Gibson's work, they realized that it was, as Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward." Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read "<a href="Burning%20Chrome">Burning Chrome</a>" – the first cyberspace short story – to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling "completely got it".

In October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for <a href="ArmadilloCon">ArmadilloCon</a>, at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called "Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF", where Shiner noted "the sense of a movement solidified". After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that "a new axis has been formed." Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with <a href="Rudy%20Rucker">Rudy Rucker</a>, went on to form the core of the radical <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> literary movement.

Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a> and <a href="cyberspace">cyberspace</a> (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech <a href="shanty%20town">shanty town</a>s, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in "Neuromancer"), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "Fragments of a Hologram Rose", in the Summer 1977 issue of "<a href="Science%20fiction%20magazine%23Defunct">Unearth</a>". The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection "<a href="Burning%20Chrome%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">Burning Chrome</a>", as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."

Beginning in 1981, Gibson's stories appeared in "<a href="Omni%20%28magazine%29">Omni</a>" and "Universe 11", wherein his fiction developed a bleak, "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>" feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "<a href="The%20Gernsback%20Continuum">The Gernsback Continuum</a>"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor <a href="cult%20following">cult figure</a>, a sort of lesser <a href="J.%20G.%20Ballard">Ballard</a>." When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled ... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs ... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp."

While <a href="Larry%20McCaffery">Larry McCaffery</a> has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a> has identified them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre. The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, <a href="the%20Sprawl">the Sprawl</a> setting of "<a href="Burning%20Chrome">Burning Chrome</a>" and the character of <a href="Molly%20Millions">Molly Millions</a> from "<a href="Johnny%20Mnemonic">Johnny Mnemonic</a>" ultimately culminated in his first novel, "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>".

"Neuromancer" was commissioned by <a href="Terry%20Carr">Terry Carr</a> for the second series of <a href="Ace%20Science%20Fiction%20Specials">Ace Science Fiction Specials</a>, which was intended to exclusively feature <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a>s. Given a year to complete the work, Gibson undertook the actual writing out of "blind animal terror" at the obligation to write an entire novel – a feat which he felt he was "four or five years away from". After viewing the first 20 minutes of landmark cyberpunk film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" (1982) which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he "figured ["Neuromancer"] was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film." He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be "permanently shamed" following its publication; yet what resulted was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.
"Neuromancer"'s release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve, quickly becoming an underground <a href="word-of-mouth">word-of-mouth</a> hit. It became the first winner of one science fiction "triple crown" —both <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula</a> and <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a>s as the year's best novel and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick%20Award">Philip K. Dick Award</a> as the best <a href="paperback%20original">paperback original</a>— eventually selling more than 6.5 million copies worldwide.

<a href="Lawrence%20Person">Lawrence Person</a> in his "Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto" (1998) identified "Neuromancer" as "the archetypal cyberpunk work", and in 2005, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" included it in its list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, opining that "[t]here is no way to overstate how radical ["Neuromancer"] was when it first appeared." Literary critic <a href="Larry%20McCaffery">Larry McCaffery</a> described the concept of the matrix in "Neuromancer" as a place where "data dance with human consciousness ... human memory is literalized and mechanized ... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman." Gibson later commented on himself as an author, circa "Neuromancer", that "I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money," and referred to the novel as "an adolescent's book". The success of "Neuromancer" was to effect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in "Neuromancer", his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically. He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>, titled "The Log of the Mustang Sally", but reneged on the contract with <a href="Arbor%20House">Arbor House</a> after a falling out over the <a href="dustjacket">dustjacket</a> art of their hardcover of "Count Zero". Abandoning "The Log of the Mustang Sally", Gibson instead wrote "<a href="Mona%20Lisa%20Overdrive">Mona Lisa Overdrive</a>" (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery "turned off the lights" on cyberpunk literature. It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same <a href="fictional%20universe">universe</a> with shared characters, thereby completing the <a href="Sprawl%20trilogy">Sprawl trilogy</a>. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation, with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations.

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel "<a href="The%20Difference%20Engine">The Difference Engine</a>", an <a href="alternate%20history%20%28fiction%29">alternative history</a> novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with <a href="Bruce%20Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a>. Set in a technologically advanced <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Nebula Award for Best Novel</a> in 1991 and the <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%20Memorial%20Award">John W. Campbell Memorial Award</a> in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.

Gibson's second series, the "<a href="Bridge%20trilogy">Bridge trilogy</a>", is composed of "<a href="Virtual%20Light">Virtual Light</a>" (1993), a "darkly comic urban detective story", "<a href="Idoru">Idoru</a>" (1996), and "<a href="All%20Tomorrow%27s%20Parties%20%28novel%29">All Tomorrow's Parties</a>" (1999). The first and third books in the trilogy center on San Francisco in the near future; all three explore Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy. <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>'s <a href="Andrew%20Leonard">Andrew Leonard</a> notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>s of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media – namely <a href="Tabloid%20press">tabloid</a> television and the <a href="cult%20of%20celebrity">cult of celebrity</a>. "Virtual Light" depicts an "end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion", according to one review. This argument on the mass media as the natural evolution of capitalism is the opening line of the major <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist</a> work "<a href="The%20Society%20of%20the%20Spectacle">The Society of the Spectacle</a>". Leonard's review called "Idoru" a "return to form" for Gibson, while critic <a href="Steven%20Poole">Steven Poole</a> asserted that "All Tomorrow's Parties" marked his development from "science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future."

After "All Tomorrow's Parties", Gibson began to adopt a more <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realist</a> style of writing, with continuous narratives – "speculative fiction of the very recent past." Science fiction critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> has interpreted this approach as Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible "in a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from", characterizing it as "SF for the new century". Gibson's novels "<a href="Pattern%20Recognition%20%28novel%29">Pattern Recognition</a>" (2003), "<a href="Spook%20Country">Spook Country</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Zero%20History">Zero History</a>" (2010) are set in the same contemporary universe — "more or less the same one we live in now" — and put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. As well as the setting, the novels share some of the same characters, including <a href="Hubertus%20Bigend">Hubertus Bigend</a> and Pamela Mainwaring, employees of the enigmatic marketing company Blue Ant.

When asked, on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, what this series of novels should be called ("The Bigend Trilogy? The Blue Ant Cycle? What?"), Gibson replied "I prefer 'books'. The Bigend books." However, "Blue Ant" rather than "Bigend" has become the standard signifier. At a later date, Gibson stated that he did not name his trilogies, "I wait to see what people call them," and has in 2016 used "the Blue Ant books" in a tweet.

A phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of <a href="annotation">annotating</a> fansites, "PR-Otaku" and "<a href="Node%20Magazine">Node Magazine</a>", devoted to "Pattern Recognition" and "Spook Country" respectively. These websites tracked the references and story elements in the novels through online resources such as <a href="Google">Google</a> and <a href="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> and collated the results, essentially creating <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a> versions of the books. Critic <a href="John%20Sutherland%20%28author%29">John Sutherland</a> characterized this phenomenon as threatening "to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is conducted".

After the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, with about 100 pages of "Pattern Recognition" written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, which had been suddenly rendered implausible; he called it "the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction." He saw the attacks as a nodal point in history, "an experience out of culture", and "in some ways ... the true beginning of the 21st century." He is noted as one of the first novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing. Examination of cultural changes in post-September 11 America, including a resurgent <a href="tribalism">tribalism</a> and the "<a href="infantilization">infantilization</a> of society", became a prominent theme of Gibson's work. The focus of his writing nevertheless remains "at the intersection of paranoia and technology".

William Gibson's most recent novel is titled "<a href="The%20Peripheral">The Peripheral</a>". He described the story briefly in an appearance he made at the New York Public Library on April 19, 2013, and read an excerpt from the first chapter of the book entitled "The Gone Haptics." The story takes place in two eras, one about thirty years into the future and the other further in the future. "The Peripheral" was released on October 28, 2014.

Its continuation, "<a href="Agency%20%28novel%29">Agency</a>", is to be released on April 2, 2019, after being delayed from an initial announced release date of December 2018.

In 2017, Gibson's comic/graphic novel "<a href="Archangel%20%28Gibson%20comic%29">Archangel</a>" was published. Both "Archangel" and "The Peripheral" contain time travel (of sorts), but Gibson has clarified that the works are not related: "They're not "same universe". The Splitter and trans-continual virtuality are different mechanisms (different plot mechanisms too)."

Three of the stories that later appeared in "<a href="Burning%20Chrome%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">Burning Chrome</a>" were written in collaboration with other authors: "<a href="The%20Belonging%20Kind">The Belonging Kind</a>" (1981) with <a href="John%20Shirley">John Shirley</a>, "<a href="Red%20Star%2C%20Winter%20Orbit">Red Star, Winter Orbit</a>" (1983) with Sterling, and "<a href="Dogfight%20%28short%20story%29">Dogfight</a>" (1985) with <a href="Michael%20Swanwick">Michael Swanwick</a>. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel "City Come A-walkin" and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection "Heatseeker" (1989). Shirley convinced Gibson to write a story for the television series "<a href="Max%20Headroom%20%28TV%20series%29">Max Headroom</a>" for which Shirley had written several scripts, but the network canceled the series.

Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story "The Angel of Goliad" in 1990, which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate history story "<a href="The%20Difference%20Engine">The Difference Engine</a>" (1990). The two were later "invited to dream in public" (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 ("the <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a> people"), in which they argued against the <a href="digital%20divide">digital divide</a> and "appalled everyone" by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet. In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for "a second <a href="recursive%20science%20novel">recursive science novel</a> that was just a wonderful idea", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration because he was not creatively free at the time.

In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on <a href="Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a>'s "<a href="Technodon">Technodon</a>" album, and wrote lyrics to the track "Dog Star Girl" for Deborah Harry's "<a href="Debravation">Debravation</a>".

Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of "Neuromancer" on a beach at a <a href="Thailand">Thai</a> resort. His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by <a href="Kathryn%20Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a>) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made. In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of "<a href="Alien%203">Alien 3</a>" (which he later characterized as "<a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Tarkovskian</a>"), few elements of which survived in the final version. In 2018-19, <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> released a five-part adaptation of Gibson's "Alien 3" script. 
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director <a href="Rashid%20Nugmanov">Rashid Nugmanov</a> after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician <a href="Viktor%20Tsoi">Viktor Tsoi</a>. Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully odd project" which involved "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a>" and sent <a href="Jack%20Womack">Jack Womack</a> to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel "<a href="Let%27s%20Put%20the%20Future%20Behind%20Us">Let's Put the Future Behind Us</a>" and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's "<a href="Pattern%20Recognition%20%28novel%29">Pattern Recognition</a>". A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker <a href="Sogo%20Ishii">Sogo Ishii</a> in 1991, a film they planned on shooting in the <a href="Walled%20City%20of%20Kowloon">Walled City of Kowloon</a> until the city was demolished in 1993.

Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the <a href="Sprawl%20trilogy">Sprawl trilogy</a> universe, have been loosely adapted as films: "<a href="Johnny%20Mnemonic%20%28film%29">Johnny Mnemonic</a>" (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and <a href="Takeshi%20Kitano">Takeshi Kitano</a>, and "<a href="New%20Rose%20Hotel%20%28film%29">New Rose Hotel</a>" (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> interactive video game. , <a href="Vincenzo%20Natali">Vincenzo Natali</a> still hoped to bring "Neuromancer" to the screen, after some years in <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a>. "<a href="Count%20Zero">Count Zero</a>" was at one point being developed as "The Zen Differential" with director <a href="Michael%20Mann%20%28film%20director%29">Michael Mann</a> attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, "<a href="Mona%20Lisa%20Overdrive">Mona Lisa Overdrive</a>", has also been optioned and bought. An <a href="anime">anime</a> adaptation of "<a href="Idoru">Idoru</a>" was announced as in development in 2006, and "Pattern Recognition" was in the process of development by director <a href="Peter%20Weir">Peter Weir</a>, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20Rotterdam">International Film Festival Rotterdam</a> in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story "Dogfight" by <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> award-winning writer and director <a href="Simon%20Pummell">Simon Pummell</a>. Written by Gibson and <a href="Michael%20Swanwick">Michael Swanwick</a> and first published in <a href="Omni%20%28magazine%29">Omni</a> in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer <a href="Janine%20Marmot">Janine Marmot</a> at Hot Property Films.

Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend <a href="Tom%20Maddox">Tom Maddox</a>, "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" episodes "<a href="Kill%20Switch%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Kill Switch</a>" and "<a href="First%20Person%20Shooter%20%28The%20X-Files%29">First Person Shooter</a>", broadcast in the U.S. on <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Television">20th Century Fox Television</a> in 1998 and 2000. In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication "Art of the X-Files". Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries "<a href="Wild%20Palms">Wild Palms</a>" at the behest of creator <a href="Bruce%20Wagner">Bruce Wagner</a>. Director <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series, and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, "Where The Holograms Go", to the "Wild Palms Reader". He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside <a href="Douglas%20Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a> in the short film "<a href="Mon%20Amour%20Mon%20Parapluie">Mon Amour Mon Parapluie</a>" in which the pair played philosophers. Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called "<a href="No%20Maps%20for%20These%20Territories">No Maps for These Territories</a>". The film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from "Neuromancer" by <a href="Bono">Bono</a> and <a href="The%20Edge">The Edge</a>.

<a href="Last%20Studio%20Standing%20Inc.">Last Studio Standing Inc.</a>, a Canadian-based animation studio, acquired the rights to "Hinterlands" in 2016 and announced that they will be creating both a theatrical short film and a television series. The studio, which specializes in adult and science fiction based animation, has the theatrical short slated for a 2018 release.

As of April 2018, <a href="Amazon%20%28company%29">Amazon</a> is developing a series based on Gibson's novel "The Peripheral".

Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a> pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future "<a href="Johnny%20Mnemonic%20%28film%29">Johnny Mnemonic</a>" director <a href="Robert%20Longo">Robert Longo</a> titled "Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes", which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to "Memory Palace", a performance show featuring the theater group <a href="La%20Fura%20dels%20Baus">La Fura dels Baus</a> at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by <a href="Karl%20Sims">Karl Sims</a>, <a href="Rebecca%20Allen%20%28artist%29">Rebecca Allen</a>, <a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a> with music by <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> and others. It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and "cyberprops" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of "Burning Chrome" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company <a href="Holy%20Body%20Tattoo">Holy Body Tattoo</a> and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.

In 1990, Gibson contributed to "Visionary San Francisco", an exhibition at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a> shown from June 14 to August 26. He wrote a short story, "<a href="Skinner%27s%20Room">Skinner's Room</a>", set in a decaying San Francisco in which the <a href="San%20Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge">San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge</a> was closed and taken over by the homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the <a href="Bridge%20trilogy">Bridge trilogy</a>. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge. The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from "Skinner's Room". "The New York Times" hailed the exhibition as "one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution "a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work". A slightly different version of the short story was featured a year later in "<a href="Omni%20%28magazine%29">Omni</a>".

A particularly well-received work by Gibson was "<a href="Agrippa%20%28a%20book%20of%20the%20dead%29">Agrippa (a book of the dead)</a>" (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist <a href="Dennis%20Ashbaugh">Dennis Ashbaugh</a> and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5" <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> embedded in the back of an <a href="artist%27s%20book">artist's book</a> containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself." Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually "<a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hacked</a>"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the <a href="MindVox">MindVox</a> bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.

Since its debut in 1992, the mystery of "Agrippa" remained hidden for 20 years. Although many had tried to hack the code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at "The Agrippa Files" created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They collaborated with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the <a href="Maryland%20Institute%20for%20Technology%20in%20the%20Humanities">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, in calling for the aid of cryptographers to figure out how the program works by creating "Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge", which enlisted participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes. The code was successfully cracked by Robert Xiao in late July 2012.

Gibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" and of <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a>s to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", and has written for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", "<a href="Addicted%20to%20Noise">Addicted to Noise</a>", "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">New York Times Magazine</a>", "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", and "<a href="Details%20Magazine">Details Magazine</a>". His first major piece of nonfiction, the article "<a href="Disneyland%20with%20the%20Death%20Penalty">Disneyland with the Death Penalty</a>" concerning the city-state of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, resulted in "Wired" being banned from the country and attracted a spirited critical response. He commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into his reaction to "<a href="Pattern%20Recognition%20%28novel%29">Pattern Recognition</a>", but abated in September of the same year owing to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative process.

Gibson recommenced blogging in October 2004, and during the process of writing "<a href="Spook%20Country">Spook Country</a>" – and to a lesser extent "<a href="Zero%20History">Zero History</a>" – frequently posted short nonsequential excerpts from the novel to the blog. The blog was largely discontinued by July 2009, after the writer had undertaken prolific microblogging on Twitter under the "nom de plume" "GreatDismal". In 2012, Gibson released a collection of his non-fiction works entitled "<a href="Distrust%20That%20Particular%20Flavor">Distrust That Particular Flavor</a>".

Hailed by <a href="Steven%20Poole">Steven Poole</a> of "The Guardian" in 1999 as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades" in terms of influence, Gibson first achieved critical recognition with his <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a>, "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>". The novel won three major science fiction awards (the <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a>, the <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick%20Award">Philip K. Dick Award</a>, and the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a>), an unprecedented achievement described by the "<a href="Mail%20%26amp%3B%20Guardian">Mail & Guardian</a>" as "the sci-fi writer's version of winning the <a href="Prix%20Goncourt">Goncourt</a>, <a href="Man%20Booker%20Prize">Booker</a> and <a href="Pulitzer%20prize">Pulitzer prize</a>s in the same year". "Neuromancer" gained unprecedented critical and popular attention outside science fiction, as an "evocation of life in the late 1980s", although "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" noted that "it took the "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" 10 years" to mention the novel.

Gibson's work has received international attention from an audience that was not limited to science fiction aficionados as, in the words of Laura Miller, "readers found startlingly prophetic reflections of contemporary life in [its] fantastic and often outright paranoid scenarios." It is often situated by critics within the context of <a href="postindustrialism">postindustrialism</a> as, according to academic David Brande, a construction of "a mirror of existing large-scale techno-social relations", and as a narrative version of postmodern <a href="consumer%20culture">consumer culture</a>. It is praised by critics for its depictions of <a href="late%20capitalism">late capitalism</a> and its "rewriting of subjectivity, human consciousness and behaviour made newly problematic by technology." Tatiani Rapatzikou, writing in "<a href="The%20Literary%20Encyclopedia">The Literary Encyclopedia</a>", identifies Gibson as "one of North America's most highly acclaimed science fiction writers".

In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in "The Literary Encyclopedia" with effectively "renovating" science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely "insignificant", influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in <a href="science%20fiction%20studies">science fiction studies</a>. In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature. The publication of "Neuromancer" (1984) hit a cultural nerve, causing <a href="Larry%20McCaffery">Larry McCaffery</a> to credit Gibson with virtually launching the <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> movement, as "the one major writer who is original and gifted to make the whole movement seem original and gifted." Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian <a href="Dwayne%20A.%20Day">Dwayne A. Day</a> as some of the best examples of <a href="outer%20space">space-based</a> science fiction (or "solar sci-fi"), and "probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking".

Gibson's early novels were, according to "The Observer", "seized upon by the emerging <a href="slacker">slacker</a> and <a href="Hacker%20culture">hacker</a> generation as a kind of road map". 
Through his novels, such terms as "<a href="cyberspace">cyberspace</a>", "<a href="netsurfing">netsurfing</a>", "<a href="Intrusion%20Countermeasures%20Electronics">ICE</a>", "jacking in", and "<a href="neural%20implant">neural implant</a>s" entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, virtual interaction and "the matrix". In "<a href="Burning%20Chrome">Burning Chrome</a>" (1982), he coined the term "cyberspace", referring to the "mass consensual <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>" of <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>s. Through its use in "Neuromancer", the term gained such recognition that it became the "de facto" term for the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a> during the 1990s. Artist <a href="Dike%20Blair">Dike Blair</a> has commented that Gibson's "terse descriptive phrases capture the moods which surround technologies, rather than their engineering."

Gibson's work has influenced several popular musicians: references to his fiction appear in the music of <a href="Stuart%20Hamm">Stuart Hamm</a>, <a href="Billy%20Idol">Billy Idol</a>, <a href="Warren%20Zevon">Warren Zevon</a>, <a href="Deltron%203030">Deltron 3030</a>, <a href="Straylight%20Run">Straylight Run</a> (whose name is derived from a sequence in "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>") and <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>. <a href="U2">U2</a>'s "<a href="Zooropa">Zooropa</a>" album was heavily influenced by "Neuromancer", and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of "Neuromancer" above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of "Neuromancer" as well as appearing in "No Maps for These Territories", a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing an article about the band's <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a> for "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" in August 2005. The band <a href="Zeromancer">Zeromancer</a> take their name from "Neuromancer".

The film "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>" (1999) drew inspiration for its title, characters and story elements from the <a href="Sprawl%20trilogy">Sprawl trilogy</a>. The characters of <a href="Neo%20%28The%20Matrix%29">Neo</a> and <a href="Trinity%20%28The%20Matrix%29">Trinity</a> in "The Matrix" are similar to Bobby Newmark ("<a href="Count%20Zero">Count Zero</a>") and <a href="Molly%20Millions">Molly</a> ("<a href="Johnny%20Mnemonic">Johnny Mnemonic</a>", "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>"). Like Turner, protagonist of Gibson's "Count Zero", characters in "The Matrix" download instructions (to fly a helicopter and to "know kung fu", respectively) directly into their heads, and both "Neuromancer" and "The Matrix" feature <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>s which strive to free themselves from human control. Critics have identified marked similarities between "Neuromancer" and the film's cinematography and tone. In spite of his initial reticence about seeing the film on its release, Gibson later described it as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact." In 2008 he received honorary doctorates from <a href="Simon%20Fraser%20University">Simon Fraser University</a> and <a href="Coastal%20Carolina%20University">Coastal Carolina University</a>.

In "Neuromancer", Gibson first used the term "<a href="wikt%3Amatrix">matrix</a>" to refer to the visualized Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the computer networks of the 1970s. Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide <a href="Telecommunications%20network">communications network</a> years before the origin of the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>, although related notions had previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote "<a href="Burning%20Chrome">Burning Chrome</a>", Gibson "had a hunch that [the Internet] would change things, in the same way that the ubiquity of the automobile changed things." In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as "one of the most fascinating and unprecedented human achievements of the century", a new kind of civilization that is – in terms of significance — on a par with the birth of cities, and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>.

Observers contend that Gibson's influence on the development of the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an <a href="iconography">iconography</a> for the <a href="information%20age">information age</a>, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream. Gibson introduced, in "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>", the notion of the "<a href="meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a>", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of <a href="virtual%20sex">virtual sex</a>. His influence on early pioneers of <a href="desktop%20environment">desktop environment</a> digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from <a href="Parsons%20The%20New%20School%20for%20Design">Parsons The New School for Design</a>. <a href="Steven%20Poole">Steven Poole</a> claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of "Neuromancer", fellow author <a href="Jack%20Womack">Jack Womack</a> suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of "Neuromancer" in 1984, asking "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, "brought it about"?"
Gibson scholar Tatiani G. Rapatzikou has commented, in "Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson", on the origin of the notion of cyberspace:
In his <a href="Sprawl%20trilogy">Sprawl</a> and <a href="Bridge%20trilogy">Bridge</a> trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities. Not all responses to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer <a href="Mark%20Pesce">Mark Pesce</a>, though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that "no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally affected the direction of the hacker community," dismissed them as "adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment." In "<a href="Pattern%20Recognition%20%28novel%29">Pattern Recognition</a>", the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 <a href="lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion that the creators of lonelygirl15 drew influence from him. Another phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a>, for example in "<a href="Virtual%20Light">Virtual Light</a>", which featured a satirical extrapolated version of "<a href="Cops%20%28TV%20series%29">COPS</a>".

When an interviewer in 1988 asked about the <a href="Bulletin%20Board%20System">Bulletin Board System</a> jargon in his writing, Gibson answered "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote "Neuromancer""; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote "Neuromancer" on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a>, which Gibson described as "the kind of thing <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Hemingway</a> would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an <a href="Apple%20IIc">Apple IIc</a> and <a href="AppleWorks">AppleWorks</a> to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson did not have an email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing "<a href="Idoru">Idoru</a>" when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, "I have a 2005 <a href="PowerBook%20G4">PowerBook G4</a>, a <a href="gigabyte">gig</a> of memory, <a href="wireless%20router">wireless router</a>. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch <a href="sociology%20of%20the%20Internet">how people behave around them</a>. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'."

. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" and Gibson himself report his age at the time of his father's death to be six years old, while Gibson scholar Tatiani Rapatzikou claims in "<a href="The%20Literary%20Encyclopedia">The Literary Encyclopedia</a>" that he was eight years old.
. Several track names on Hamm's "<a href="Kings%20of%20Sleep">Kings of Sleep</a>" album ("<a href="Intrusion%20Countermeasures%20Electronics">Black Ice</a>", "<a href="Count%20Zero">Count Zero</a>", "<a href="The%20Winter%20Market">Kings of Sleep</a>") reference Gibson's work.
. Idol released an album in 1993 titled "<a href="Cyberpunk%20%28album%29">Cyberpunk</a>", which featured a track named "Neuromancer". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> excoriated Idol's treatment of <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>, and Gibson later stated that Idol had "turned it into something very silly."
. Zevon's 1989 album "<a href="Transverse%20City">Transverse City</a>" was inspired by Gibson's fiction.
. Gibson later successfully resisted attempts by <a href="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> to copyright the word for their abortive foray into <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a>.
. Both the Internet with its dramatic social effects and the <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre itself were also anticipated in <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>'s 1975 novel "<a href="The%20Shockwave%20Rider">The Shockwave Rider</a>".
. The idea of a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site was first described in 1962 in a series of memos on the "Galactic Computer Network" by <a href="J.C.R.%20Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a> of <a href="DARPA">DARPA</a>.
. Gibson wrote the following in the "Author's Afterword" of "Mona Lisa Overdrive", dated July 16, 1992.

"Neuromancer" was written on a "clockwork typewriter," the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the <a href="Macintosh%20SE/30">Macintosh SE/30</a> I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black "crackle" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.

Wayne Gretzky

Wayne Douglas Gretzky (; born January 26, 1961) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> former professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed "The Great One", he has been called "<a href="List%20of%20ice%20hockey%20players%20considered%20the%20greatest%20of%20all%20time">the greatest hockey player ever</a>" by many sportswriters, players, and the league itself. Gretzky is the leading scorer in NHL history, with more goals and assists than any other player. He garnered more assists than any other player scored total points, and is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season – a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, Gretzky tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his retirement in 1999 and persisting through 2017, he <a href="List%20of%20career%20achievements%20by%20Wayne%20Gretzky">holds 61 NHL records</a>: 40 regular season records, 15 playoff records, and six <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> records.

Born and raised in <a href="Brantford">Brantford, Ontario</a>, Canada, Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played <a href="List%20of%20ice%20hockey%20leagues%23Amateur">minor hockey</a> at a level far above his peers. Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and consistently anticipated where the puck was going to be and executed the right move at the right time. Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent's net, an area that was nicknamed "Gretzky's office".

In 1978, Gretzky signed with the <a href="Indianapolis%20Racers">Indianapolis Racers</a> of the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championships. Gretzky's trade to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the <a href="1993%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1993 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California. Gretzky played briefly for the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> before finishing his career with the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>. Gretzky captured nine <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Trophies</a> as the most valuable player, 10 <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophies</a> for most <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">points</a> in a season, two <a href="Conn%20Smythe%20Trophy">Conn Smythe Trophies</a> as playoff MVP and five <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a>s (now called the <a href="Ted%20Lindsay%20Award">Ted Lindsay Award</a>) for most outstanding player as judged by his peers. He won the <a href="Lady%20Byng%20Memorial%20Trophy">Lady Byng Memorial Trophy</a> for sportsmanship and performance five times, and often spoke out against <a href="Fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey">fighting in hockey</a>.

After his retirement in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1999</a>, Gretzky was immediately inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his <a href="jersey%20number">jersey number</a> 99 league-wide, making him the only player to receive such an honour. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a>'s (IIHF) <a href="IIHF%20Centennial%20All-Star%20Team">Centennial All-Star Team</a>. Gretzky became executive director for the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national men's hockey team</a> during the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>, in which the team won a gold medal. In <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">2000</a>, he became part-owner of the <a href="Phoenix%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a>, and following the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, he became the team's head coach. In 2004, Gretzky was inducted into the <a href="Ontario%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Ontario Sports Hall of Fame</a>. In September 2009, following the <a href="Phoenix%20Coyotes%20bankruptcy%20and%20sale">Phoenix Coyotes' bankruptcy</a>, Gretzky resigned as head coach and relinquished his ownership share. In October 2016, he became partner and vice-chairman of <a href="Oilers%20Entertainment%20Group">Oilers Entertainment Group</a>.

Wayne Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961 in <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, the son of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and <a href="Walter%20Gretzky">Walter Gretzky</a>. The couple had married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for <a href="Bell%20Canada">Bell Telephone Canada</a>. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter. Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (born 1963), and brothers <a href="Keith%20Gretzky">Keith</a>, Glen and <a href="Brent%20Gretzky">Brent</a>. The family would regularly visit the farm of Wayne's grandparents, Tony and Mary, and watch "<a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>" together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score <a href="goal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">goals</a> against Mary using a souvenir stick. The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.
Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum". Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight. Additionally, Walter gave the advice to "skate where the puck's going, not where it's been". Wayne was a classic <a href="child%20prodigy">prodigy</a> whose extraordinary skills made him the target of jealous parents.

The team Gretzky played on at age six was otherwise composed of 10-year-olds. His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the 10-year-olds. According to Martin, "Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing." The sweaters for 10-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.

By age 10, Gretzky had scored an astonishing 378 goals and 139 <a href="assist%20%28ice%20hockey%29">assists</a> in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers. His play attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the "<a href="Toronto%20Telegram">Toronto Telegram</a>" in October 1971. In the 1974 <a href="Quebec%20International%20Pee-Wee%20Hockey%20Tournament">Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament</a>, Gretzky scored 26 points playing for Brantford. By age 13, he had scored over 1,000 goals. His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed. According to Walter, the "capper" was being booed on "Brantford Day" at Toronto's <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> in February 1975.

When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Canadian Amateur Hockey Association</a> to win Wayne the right to play in a different area, which was disallowed at the time. The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the <a href="Toronto%20Nationals%20%281970%E2%80%9380%29">Toronto Nationals</a>, in a league that included 20-year-olds. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the <a href="Metro%20Junior%20A%20Hockey%20League">Metro Junior B Hockey League</a> in 1975–76, with 60 points in 28 games. The following year, as a 15–16-year-old, he had 72 points in 32 games with the same team, renamed the Seneca Nationals.

Despite his offensive statistics – scoring 132 points in 60 games in Junior B – two teams bypassed him in the 1977 <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Major Junior Hockey League</a> draft of 16-year-olds. The <a href="Oshawa%20Generals">Oshawa Generals</a> picked <a href="Tom%20McCarthy%20%28ice%20hockey%2C%20born%201960%29">Tom McCarthy</a> first, and the <a href="Niagara%20Falls%20Flyers">Niagara Falls Flyers</a> picked <a href="Steve%20Peters%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Steve Peters</a> second overall. With the third pick, the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20Greyhounds">Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds</a> selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team Wayne would not move to <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Ontario">Sault Ste. Marie</a>, a <a href="northern%20Ontario">northern Ontario</a> city that inflicts a heavy travelling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne did play for the Greyhounds, at age 16. It was with the Greyhounds that Gretzky first wore the number 99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number 9—for his hockey hero <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>—but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach <a href="Murray%20MacPherson">Muzz MacPherson</a>'s suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.

In 1978, the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA) league was in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the <a href="Indianapolis%20Racers">Indianapolis Racers</a> and the <a href="Birmingham%20Bulls">Birmingham Bulls</a>. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect. However, it was Racers owner <a href="Nelson%20Skalbania">Nelson Skalbania</a> who, on June 12, 1978, signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth US$1.75 million. Gretzky scored his first professional goal against <a href="Dave%20Dryden">Dave Dryden</a> of the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later. Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a <a href="NHL%E2%80%93WHA%20merger">deal</a> to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.

Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between the Edmonton Oilers and the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%9396%29">Winnipeg Jets</a>. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked the Oilers, but the move was not that simple. On November 2, Gretzky, <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> <a href="Eddie%20Mio">Eddie Mio</a> and forward <a href="Peter%20Driscoll">Peter Driscoll</a> were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining. While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>. Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card. Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of the Edmonton Oilers, <a href="Peter%20Pocklington">Peter Pocklington</a>. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000. The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.

One of the highlights of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars and <a href="HC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a> played at Edmonton's <a href="Northlands%20Coliseum">Northlands Coliseum</a>. The WHA All-Stars were coached by <a href="Jacques%20Demers">Jacques Demers</a>, who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and Howe's son, <a href="Mark%20Howe">Mark</a>. In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4–3.

On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a 10-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>3 million, with options for 10 more years. Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at 110 points, behind <a href="Robbie%20Ftorek">Robbie Ftorek</a> and <a href="R%C3%A9al%20Cloutier">Réal Cloutier</a>. Gretzky captured the <a href="Lou%20Kaplan%20Trophy">Lou Kaplan Trophy</a> as rookie of the year, and helped the Oilers to first overall in the league. The Oilers reached the <a href="Avco%20World%20Trophy">Avco World Trophy</a> finals, where they lost to the Winnipeg Jets in six games. It was Gretzky's only year in the WHA, as the league folded following the season.

After the World Hockey Association folded in 1979, the Edmonton Oilers and three other teams <a href="WHA-NHL%20merger">joined the NHL</a>. Under the merger agreement the Oilers, like the other surviving WHA teams, were to be allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams in the <a href="1979%20NHL%20Expansion%20Draft">1979 NHL Expansion Draft</a>. The Oilers kept Gretzky on their roster, making him a "priority selection".

Gretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher and more talented league. In his first NHL season, <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20NHL%20season">1979–80</a>, Gretzky was awarded the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> as the NHL's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> (the first of eight in a row) and tied for the scoring lead with <a href="Marcel%20Dionne">Marcel Dionne</a> with 137 points. Although Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's 80, Dionne was awarded the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophy</a> because he had scored more goals (53 to 51). The season still stands as the highest point total by a first-year player in NHL history. Gretzky became the youngest player to score 50 goals, but was not eligible for the <a href="Calder%20Memorial%20Trophy">Calder Memorial Trophy</a>, given to the top NHL rookie, because of his previous year of WHA experience. The Calder was instead awarded to <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> defenceman <a href="Ray%20Bourque">Ray Bourque</a>.

In his second season, Gretzky won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164 points, breaking both <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a>'s record for assists in a season (102) and <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a>'s record for points in a season (152). He won his second straight Hart Trophy. In the first game of the <a href="1981%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1981 Stanley Cup playoffs</a>, against the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, Gretzky had five assists, a single game playoff record.

During the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20NHL%20season">1981–82 season</a>, Gretzky surpassed a record that had stood for 35 years: <a href="50%20goals%20in%2050%20games">50 goals in 50 games</a>, first set by <a href="Rocket%20Richard">Maurice "Rocket" Richard</a> during the <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20NHL%20season">1944–45 NHL season</a> and tied by <a href="Mike%20Bossy">Mike Bossy</a> during the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NHL%20season">1980–81 NHL season</a>. Gretzky accomplished the feat in only 39 games. His 50th goal of the season came on December 30, 1981, in the final seconds of a 7–5 win against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> and was his fifth of the game. Later that season, Gretzky broke Esposito's record for most goals in a season (76) on February 24, 1982, scoring three to help defeat the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a> 6–3. He ended the 1981–82 season with records of 92 goals, 120 assists, and 212 <a href="Point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">points</a> in 80 games, becoming the only player in NHL history to break the two hundred-point mark. That year, Gretzky became the first hockey player and first Canadian to be named <a href="Associated%20Press%20Male%20Athlete%20of%20the%20Year">Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year</a>. He was also named 1982 "<a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a>" by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>". <a href="The%20Canadian%20Press">The Canadian Press</a> also named Gretzky <a href="Canadian%20Newsmaker%20of%20the%20Year">Newsmaker of the Year</a> in 1982.

The following seasons saw Gretzky break his own assists record three more times (125 in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83</a>, 135 in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20NHL%20season">1984–85</a> and 163 in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NHL%20season">1985–86</a>); he also bettered that mark (120 assists) in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20NHL%20season">1986–87</a> with 121 and <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91</a> with 122, and his point record one more time (215, in 1985–86). By the time he finished playing in Edmonton, he held or shared 49 NHL records.

The Edmonton Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season. The same success was not immediate when they joined the NHL, but within four seasons, the Oilers were competing for the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>. The Oilers were a young, strong team featuring, in addition to Gretzky, future <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> including forwards <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a>, <a href="Glenn%20Anderson">Glenn Anderson</a> and <a href="Jari%20Kurri">Jari Kurri</a>; <a href="defenceman">defenceman</a> <a href="Paul%20Coffey">Paul Coffey</a>; and goaltender <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a>. Gretzky was its <a href="Captain%20%28hockey%29">captain</a> from 1983 to 1988. In 1983, they made it to the <a href="1983%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Final</a>, only to be swept by the three-time defending champion <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>. The following season, the Oilers met the Islanders in the <a href="1984%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Final</a> again, this time winning the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years.

Gretzky was named an officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> on June 25, 1984, for outstanding contribution to the sport of hockey. Since the Order ceremonies are always held during the hockey season, it took 13 years and 7 months—and two <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governors General</a>—before he could accept the honour. He was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2009 "for his continued contributions to the world of hockey, notably as one of the best players of all time, as well as for his social engagement as a philanthropist, volunteer and role model for countless young people". The Oilers also won the Stanley Cup with Gretzky in , and .

When the Oilers joined the NHL, Gretzky continued to play under his personal services contract with Oilers owner Peter Pocklington. This arrangement came under increased scrutiny by the mid-1980s, especially following reports that Pocklington had used the contract as collateral to help secure a $31 million loan with the <a href="Government%20of%20Alberta">Alberta government</a>-owned <a href="Alberta%20Treasury%20Branches">Alberta Treasury Branches</a>. Amid growing concern around the NHL that a financial institution might be able to lay claim to Gretzky's rights in the event the heavily leveraged Pocklington were to declare bankruptcy, as well as growing dissatisfaction on the part of Gretzky and his advisers, in 1987, Gretzky and Pocklington agreed to replace the personal services contract with a standard NHL contract.

In June 1985, as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board of Governors made a decision to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called. The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL, because during the early 1980s, when the Gretzky-era Oilers entered a four-on-four or three-on-three situation with an opponent, they frequently used the space on the ice to score one or more goals. Gretzky held a press conference one day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, criticizing the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited. The rule change became known as the "Gretzky rule". The rule was reversed for the 1992–93 season.

Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and in the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy. Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Gretzky, became the highest scoring team in NHL history.

"He was, I think, the first Canadian forward to play a true team game", said hockey writer and former NHL goaltender <a href="Ken%20Dryden">Ken Dryden</a>. The focus of the game prior to Gretzky's arrival, he said, especially among the Canadian teams, was on the player with the puck—in getting the puck to a star player who would make the big play. "Gretzky reversed that. He knew he wasn't big enough, strong enough, or even fast enough to do what he wanted to do if others focused on him. Like a magician, he had to direct attention elsewhere, to his four teammates on the ice with him, to create the momentary distraction in order to move unnoticed into the open ice where size and strength didn't matter. . . . Gretzky made his opponents compete with five players, not one, and he made his teammates full partners to the game. He made them skate to his level and pass and finish up to his level or they would be embarrassed."

Between 1982 and 1985, the Edmonton Oilers averaged 423 goals a season, when no previous team had scored 400, and Gretzky on his own had averaged 207 points, when no player before had scored more than 152 in one year. Dryden wrote in his book "<a href="The%20Game%20%28Dryden%20book%29">The Game</a>", "In the past, defenders and teams had learned to devise strategies to stop opponents with the puck. To stop them without it, that was interference. But now, if players without the puck skated just as hard as those with it, but faster, and dodged and darted to open ice just as determinedly, but more effectively, how did you shut them down?"

In this, Gretzky added his considerable influence as the preeminent NHL star of his day to that of the Soviets, who had also developed a more team-style of play, and had successfully used it against the best NHL teams, beginning in the <a href="1972%20Summit%20Series">1972 Summit Series</a>. "The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game", says Dryden. "Gretzky, the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name, was the acceptable face of Soviet hockey. No Canadian kid wanted to play like <a href="Sergei%20Makarov%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Makarov</a> or <a href="Igor%20Larionov">Larionov</a>. They all wanted to play like Gretzky."

At the same time, Gretzky recognized the contributions of their coach in the success of the Oilers: "Under the guidance of <a href="Glen%20Sather">Glen Sather</a>, our Oiler teams became adept at generating speed, developing finesse, and learning a transition game with strong European influences."

Gretzky explains his style of play further:
Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team. Walter Gretzky had known for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania, but kept the news from Wayne so as not to upset him. According to Walter, Wayne was being "shopped" to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well. At first, Wayne did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call while on his honeymoon from <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> owner <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a> asking permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that <a href="Marty%20McSorley">Marty McSorley</a> and <a href="Mike%20Krushelnyski">Mike Krushelnyski</a> join him as teammates in Los Angeles. Both McNall and Pocklington quickly agreed. After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade. When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to Los Angeles, Sather tried to stop the deal, but when he found out Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested <a href="Luc%20Robitaille">Luc Robitaille</a> in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering <a href="Jimmy%20Carson">Jimmy Carson</a>.

On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky (along with McSorley and Krushelnyski) to the Kings for Carson, <a href="Martin%20G%C3%A9linas">Martin Gélinas</a>, $15 million in cash and the Kings' first-round draft picks in <a href="1989%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1989</a> (later traded to the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> – New Jersey selected <a href="Jason%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Jason Miller</a>), <a href="1991%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1991</a> (<a href="Martin%20Ru%C4%8D%C3%ADnsk%C3%BD">Martin Ručínský</a>) and <a href="1993%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1993</a> (<a href="Nick%20Stajduhar">Nick Stajduhar</a>). "The Trade", as it came to be known, upset Canadians to the extent that <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Canada%29">New Democratic Party</a> <a href="House%20Leader">House Leader</a> <a href="Nelson%20Riis">Nelson Riis</a> demanded the government block it, and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside Northlands Coliseum. Gretzky himself was considered a "traitor" by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of <a href="Janet%20Jones">his wife</a>'s acting career.

In Gretzky's first appearance in Edmonton after the trade, a game nationally televised in Canada, he received a four-minute standing ovation. The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest crowd ever to that date. Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for Mark Messier's body check of Gretzky into the boards. After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: "I'm still proud to be a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a>. I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that." After the 1988–89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head.

The Kings named Gretzky their <a href="alternate%20captain">alternate captain</a>. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular season game. The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight en route to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being <a href="Underdog%20%28competition%29">underdogs</a> against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in the <a href="Smythe%20Division">Smythe Division</a> semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings' return from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series 4–3. He was nervous Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were eagerly waiting for him. For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly edged the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>' <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP. In 1990, the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> named Gretzky Male Athlete of the Decade.

Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and <a href="Fan%20%28aficionado%29">fan</a> interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings now boasted of numerous sellouts. Many credit Gretzky's arrival with putting non-traditional American hockey markets on "the NHL map"; not only did California receive two more NHL franchises (the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a> and <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>) during Gretzky's tenure in Los Angeles, but his popularity in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> proved to be an impetus in the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20in%20the%20United%20States">league establishing teams in other parts of the US Sun Belt</a>.

Gretzky was sidelined for much of the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1992–93 regular season</a> with a back injury, and his 65-point output ended a record 13-year streak in which he recorded at least 100 points each season. However, he performed well in the playoffs, notably when he scored a <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a> in game seven of the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Campbell Conference</a> Finals against the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. This victory propelled the Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, where they faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the first game of the series by a score of 4–1, the team lost the next three games in overtime, and then fell 4–1 in the deciding fifth game where Gretzky failed to get a shot on net.

The next season, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's career goal-scoring record and won the scoring title, but the team began a long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1998</a>. After the financially troubled McNall was forced to sell the Kings in 1994, Gretzky's relationship with the Kings' new owners grew strained. Under both McNall and the new ownership group, the team was fiscally unstable, to the point that paychecks to players bounced. Finally, in early 1996, Gretzky requested a trade. During the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout">1994–95 NHL lockout</a>, Gretzky and some friends (including Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, <a href="Brett%20Hull">Brett Hull</a> and <a href="Steve%20Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a>) formed the <a href="Ninety%20Nine%20All%20Stars%20Tour">Ninety Nine All Stars Tour</a> and played eight exhibition games in various countries.

On February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in a trade for <a href="Patrice%20Tardif">Patrice Tardif</a>, <a href="Roman%20Vopat">Roman Vopat</a>, <a href="Craig%20Johnson%20%28ice%20hockey%2C%20born%201972%29">Craig Johnson</a> and two draft picks (<a href="Peter%20Hogan%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Peter Hogan</a> and <a href="Matt%20Zultek">Matt Zultek</a>). He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles. At the time of the trade, the Blues and <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands. Gretzky was immediately named the team's captain. He scored 37 points in 31 games for the team in the regular season and the playoffs, and the Blues came within one game of the Conference Finals. However, the chemistry everyone expected with winger Brett Hull never developed, and head coach Mike Keenan publicly criticized him. Gretzky rejected a three-year deal worth $15 million with the Blues, and on July 21, signed with the New York Rangers as a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>, rejoining longtime Oilers teammate Mark Messier for a two-year, $8 million (plus incentives) contract.

Gretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1997</a>. The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with 10 goals and 10 assists. For the first time in his NHL career, Gretzky was not named captain, although he briefly wore the captain's "C" in 1998 when captain <a href="Brian%20Leetch">Brian Leetch</a> was injured and out of the line-up. After the 1996–97 season, Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>, ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky after just one season. The Rangers did not return to the playoffs until <a href="2006%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2006</a>, well after Gretzky retired.

In 1997, prior to his retirement, "<a href="The%20Hockey%20News">The Hockey News</a>" named a committee of 50 hockey experts (former NHL players, past and present writers, broadcasters, coaches and hockey executives) to select and rank the 50 greatest players in NHL history. The experts voted Gretzky number one. Gretzky said he would have voted Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe as the best of all time.

The <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1998–99</a> season was his last as a professional player. He reached one milestone in this last season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring record of 1,071, which had been held by Gordie Howe. Gretzky was having difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals, contributing to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a point per game, but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined NHL/WHA career to 1,072, one more than Howe. As the season wound down, there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire, but he refused to announce his retirement. His last NHL game in Canada was on April 15, 1999, a 2–2 tie with the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> and the Rangers' second-to-last game of the season. Following the contest, in a departure from the usual <a href="Three%20stars%20%28ice%20hockey%29">three stars</a> announcement, Gretzky was awarded all three stars. Upon returning to New York, Gretzky announced he would retire after the Rangers' last game of the season.

The final game of Gretzky's career was a 2–1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 18, 1999, in <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. Although the game involved two American teams, both <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a>s were played, with the lyrics slightly adjusted to accommodate Gretzky's departure. In place of the lyrics "O Canada, we stand on guard for thee", <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a> ad-libbed, "We're going to miss you, Wayne Gretzky". "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>", as sung by <a href="John%20Amirante">John Amirante</a>, was altered to include the words "in the land of Wayne Gretzky". Gretzky ended his career with a final point, assisting on the lone New York goal scored by Brian Leetch. At the time of his retirement, Gretzky was the second-to-last WHA player still active in professional hockey. Mark Messier, who attended the game along with other representatives of the Edmonton Oilers' dynasty, was the last.

Gretzky told journalist Scott Morrison that the final game of his career was his greatest day. He recounted: 

Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national junior team</a> at the <a href="1978%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1978 World Junior Championships</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Quebec. He was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and <a href="List%20of%20IIHF%20World%20Under%2020%20Championship%20Directorate%20award%20winners">Best Forward</a> honours. His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior Championships. Canada finished with the bronze medal.

Gretzky debuted with the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada's men's team</a> at the <a href="1981%20Canada%20Cup">1981 Canada Cup</a>. He led the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish to the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet Union</a>, losing 8–1 in the final. Seven months later, Gretzky joined Team Canada for the <a href="1982%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1982 World Championships</a> in Finland. He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort in Canada's final game against <a href="Sweden%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Sweden</a> to earn the bronze. Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the <a href="1984%20Canada%20Cup">1984 Canada Cup</a>, when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals. He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star Team.

Gretzky's international career highlight arguably came three years later at the <a href="1987%20Canada%20Cup">1987 Canada Cup</a>. Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he had played in his life. Playing on a line with Pittsburgh Penguins' superstar Mario Lemieux, he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games. After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance in the second game, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime, to extend the tournament. In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner. With the score tied 5–5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3-on-1 with defenceman <a href="Larry%20Murphy%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Larry Murphy</a>. Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.

The <a href="1991%20Canada%20Cup">1991 Canada Cup</a> marked the last time the tournament was played under the "Canada Cup" moniker. Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games. He did not, however, compete in the final against the <a href="United%20States%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">United States</a> due to a back injury. Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4–1 and 4–2. Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the <a href="World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">World Cup</a> in <a href="1996%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">1996</a>. It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight games for fourth overall.

Leading up to the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%201998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Nagano%20%28city%29">Nagano</a>, Japan, it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time. Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997. However, Gretzky was passed over for the captaincy, along with several other Canadian veterans including Steve Yzerman and Ray Bourque in favour of the younger <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a>. Expectations were high for the Canadian team, but the team lost to the <a href="Czech%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a> in the semi-finals. The game went to a shootout with a 1–1 tie after overtime, but Gretzky was controversially not selected by coach <a href="Marc%20Crawford">Marc Crawford</a> as one of the five shooters, all of whom failed to score. Team Canada then lost the bronze medal game 3–2 to <a href="Finland%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Finland</a> to finish without a medal. The Olympics marked Gretzky's eighth and final international appearance, finishing with four assists in six games. He retired from international play holding the records for most goals (20), most assists (28), and most overall points (48) in best-on-best hockey.

Gretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game. His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, "He was so much more intelligent. While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things."

He was also considered one of the most creative players in hockey. "You never knew what he was going to do", said hockey Hall of Famer <a href="Igor%20Larionov">Igor Larionov</a>. "He was improvising all the time. Every time he took the ice, there was some spontaneous decision he would make. That's what made him such a phenomenal player." Gretzky's ability to improvise came into the spotlight at the 1998 Olympics in Japan. Then an older player in the sunset of his career, he had been passed over for the captaincy of the team. But as the series continued, his unique skills made him a <a href="team%20leader">team leader</a>.

The Canadians had trouble with the big ice. They had trouble with the European patterns and the lateral play and the endless, inventive cycling. … Slowly, as game after game went by and the concern continued to rise, Wayne Gretzky began climbing through the line-up. He, almost alone among the Canadians, seemed to take to the larger ice surface as if it offered more opportunity instead of obligation…. His playing time soared, as he was being sent on not just for power plays but double shifts and even penalty kills. By the final round … it was Wayne Gretzky who assumed the leadership both on and off the ice.
He passed and shot with prodigious skill. Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, "He passes better than anybody I've ever seen." In his first two seasons in the NHL, his deft passing skills helped earn him a reputation as an ace playmaker, and so opposing defencemen focused their efforts on foiling his attempts to pass the puck to other scorers. In response, Gretzky started shooting on goal himself—and with exceptional effectiveness. He had a fast and accurate shot. "Wayne Gretzky was one of the most accurate scorers in NHL history", said one biography. Statistics support the contention: whereas Phil Esposito, who had set the previous goal-scoring record, needed 550 shots to score 76 goals, Gretzky netted his 76th after only 287 shots—about half as many. He scored his all-time record of 92 goals with just 369 shots. Because he was so light compared to other players, goalies were often surprised by how hard Gretzky's shot was. Goalies called his shots "sneaky fast." He also had a way of never hitting the puck with the same rhythm twice, making his shots harder to time and block.

When he entered the league in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was "too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the [NHL]." His weight was , compared to the NHL average of at that time. But that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart Trophy for the league's most valuable player. In his second year in the league, weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, racking up 164 points. The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still "a wisp compared to the average NHL player"—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net. He weighed "about 170 pounds" for the better part of his career. He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64 kg).

However, he had remarkable physical stamina. Like his hero, Gordie Howe, Gretzky possessed "an exceptional capacity to renew his energy resources quickly." In 1980, when an exercise physiologist tested the recuperative abilities of all of the Edmonton Oilers, Gretzky scored so high the tester said that he "thought the machine had broken." His stamina is also indicated by the fact that Gretzky often scored late in the game. In the year he scored his record 92 goals, 22 of them went in the net during the first period, 30 in the second—and 40 in the third.

He also had strong general athletic skills. Growing up, he was a competitive runner and also <a href="batting%20average">batted</a> .492 for the Junior Intercounty Baseball League's Brantford CKCP Braves in the summer of 1980. As a result, he was offered a contract by the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>. History repeated itself in June 2011, when Gretzky's 17-year-old son, Trevor, was drafted by the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. Trevor signed with the Cubs the next month. Gretzky also excelled at <a href="box%20lacrosse">box lacrosse</a>, which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse.

According to him, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard <a href="Checking%20%28ice%20hockey%29">checks</a>: "In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection." Gretzky adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten rule not to hit him. Defensemen found Gretzky a most elusive target. Fellow Hockey Hall of Famer <a href="Denis%20Potvin">Denis Potvin</a> compared attempting to hit Gretzky to "wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill." The 205-pound (93 kg) Potvin, a three-time winner of the <a href="Norris%20Trophy">Norris Trophy</a> for best defenceman, added that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was "a tough guy to dislike... what was there to hate about Gretzky? It was like running <a href="Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi">Gandhi</a> into a corner."

He received a good deal of cover from burly Oiler defencemen <a href="Dave%20Semenko">Dave Semenko</a> and Marty McSorley. The latter followed Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1989, where he played the same policeman role for several more years. But Gretzky discouraged unfair hits in another way. "If a guy ran him, Wayne would embarrass that guy", said former Oiler <a href="Lee%20Fogolin">Lee Fogolin</a>. "He'd score six or seven points on him. I saw him do it night after night."

Commentators have noted Gretzky's uncanny ability to judge the position of the other players on the ice—so much so that many suspected he enjoyed some kind of extrasensory perception. Sports commentators said that he played like he had "eyes in the back of his head." Gretzky said he sensed other players more than he actually saw them. "I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be", he said. "A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking."

Veteran Canadian journalist <a href="Peter%20Gzowski">Peter Gzowski</a> says that Gretzky seemed to be able to, in effect, slow down time. "There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing." "Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions. In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender … he will … hold the puck one … extra instant, upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game, extending the moment. … He distorts time, and not only by slowing it down. Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate's stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender's armour and slipping the puck into it … before the goaltender is ready to react."

However, Gretzky denied that he had any exotic innate abilities. He said that many of his advantages were a result of his father's brilliant coaching.

Some say I have a "<a href="Extrasensory%20perception">sixth sense</a>" … Baloney. I've just learned to guess what's going to happen next. It's anticipation. It's not God-given, it's Wally-given. He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, "Watch, this is how everybody else does it." Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, "Now, this is how the smart player does it." He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. Who says anticipation can't be taught?

Gretzky learned much about hockey from his father on a backyard rink at his home. Walter Gretzky had been an outstanding Junior B hockey player. He cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills. On the backyard rink, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum", winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. Walter's drills were his own invention, and were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing new to offer him: "I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart."

In his autobiography, Gretzky describes how at practices his dad would drill him on the fundamentals of smart hockey:

<poem>Him: "Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?"
Me: "The guy he's passing to."
Him: "Which means..."
Me: "Get over there and intercept it."
Him: "Where do you skate?"
Me: "To where the puck is going, not where it's been."
Him: "If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?"
Me: "Peel."
Him: "Which way?"
Me: "Away from the guy, not towards him."</poem>

Gretzky also salutes his coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen ("Slats") Sather, as an important influence in his development as a hockey player. Gretzky played for 10 years with the Oilers, with Sather as coach. "It's as if my father raised me until age 17, then turned me over to Slats and said, 'You take him from here.'"

Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice. "From the age of three to the age of 12, I could easily be out there for eight to 10 hours a day", Gretzky has said. In his autobiography, he wrote:

All I wanted to do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 9:00. When asked how he managed, at age ten, to score 378 goals in a single season, Gretzky explained,

See, kids usually don't start playing hockey until they're six or seven. Ice isn't grass. It's a whole new surface and everybody starts from ground zero. … By the time I was ten, I had eight years on skates instead of four, and a few seasons' worth of ice time against ten-year-olds. So I had a long head start on everyone else.

Much has been written about Gretzky's highly developed hockey instincts, but he once explained that what appeared to be instinct was, in large part, the effect of his relentless study and practice of the game, in co-operation with his coaches. As a result, he developed a deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics. Peter Gzowski says that the best of the best athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play. Analyzing Gretzky's hockey skills, he says, "What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number." Gzowski presented this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed. "Absolutely", Gretzky said. "That's a hundred percent right. It's all practice. I got it from my Dad. Nine out of ten people think it's instinct, and it isn't. Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I've put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine."

Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 22, 1999, becoming the tenth player to bypass the three-year waiting period. The Hall of Fame then announced that he would be the last player to do so. He was inducted into the <a href="IIHF%20Hall%20of%20Fame">IIHF Hall of Fame</a> in 2000. In addition, Gretzky's jersey number 99 was retired league-wide at the <a href="50th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2000 NHL All-Star Game</a>, a decision inspired by <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s retirement of the number 42 worn by <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>. In October 1999, Edmonton honoured Gretzky by renaming one of Edmonton's busiest freeways, Capilano Drive – which passes by Northlands Coliseum – to <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky%20Drive">Wayne Gretzky Drive</a>. Also in Edmonton, the local transit authority assigned a rush-hour bus route numbered No. 99 which also runs on Wayne Gretzky Drive for its commute.

In 2002, the Kings held a jersey retirement ceremony and erected a life-sized statue of Gretzky outside the <a href="Staples%20Center">Staples Center</a>; the ceremony was delayed until then so that Bruce McNall, who had recently finished a prison sentence, could attend. Also in 2002, Gretzky received a star on <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a> in Toronto. His hometown of Brantford, Ontario, renamed Park Road North to "Wayne Gretzky Parkway" as well as renaming the North Park Recreation Centre to The Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre. Brantford further inducted Gretzky into its "Walk of Fame" in 2004. On May 10, 2010, he was awarded The Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission. Gretzky was named one of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20NHL%20Players">100 Greatest NHL Players</a> in 2017.

Almost immediately after retirement, several NHL teams approached him about an ownership role. In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the <a href="Phoenix%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a> in a partnership with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, managing partner and head of hockey operations. The Coyotes were in the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, averting a potential move to <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. The sale was not completed until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take over. Trucking magnate and <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> part-owner <a href="Jerry%20Moyes">Jerry Moyes</a> was added to the partnership. Gretzky convinced his long-time agent Michael Barnett to join the team as its General Manager.

In 2005, rumours began circulating that Gretzky was about to name himself head coach of the Coyotes, but were denied by Gretzky and the team. Ultimately, Gretzky agreed to become head coach on August 8, 2005. Gretzky made his coaching debut on October 5, and won his first game on October 8 against the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>. He took an indefinite <a href="leave%20of%20absence">leave of absence</a> on December 17 to be with his ill mother. Phyllis Gretzky died of lung cancer on December 19. Gretzky resumed his head-coaching duties on December 28. The Coyotes' record at the end of the 2005–06 season was 38–39–5, a 16-win improvement over 2003–04; they were 36–36–5 in games Gretzky coached.

In 2006, Moyes became majority owner of the team. There was uncertainty about Gretzky's role until it was announced on May 31, 2006 that he had agreed to a five-year contract to remain head coach. The Coyotes' performance declined in 2006–07, as the team ended the season 15th in their conference. During Gretzky's coaching tenure, the Coyotes did not reach the postseason, and their best finish in the Western Conference standings was 12th.

On May 5, 2009, the Coyotes' holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for <a href="Chapter%2011%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy. An ownership dispute involving <a href="Research%20in%20Motion">Research in Motion</a>'s <a href="Jim%20Balsillie">Jim Balsillie</a> (with the intention of relocating the team) and the NHL itself arose, which eventually ended up in Court. Gretzky did not attend the Coyotes' training camp, leaving associate head coach <a href="Ulf%20Samuelsson">Ulf Samuelsson</a> in charge, due to an uncertain contractual status with the club, whose bankruptcy hearings were continuing. Bidders for the club had indicated that Gretzky would no longer be associated with the team after it emerged from bankruptcy, and on September 24, 2009, Gretzky stepped down as head coach and head of hockey operations of the Coyotes. Gretzky's final head coaching record was 143–161–24.

Gretzky was Executive Director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, Utah. On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a <a href="News%20conference">press conference</a>, frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team's uninspiring 1–1–1 start. His temper boiled over after Canada's 3–3 draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of "American propaganda". "They're loving us not doing well", he said, referring to American hockey fans. American fans online began calling Gretzky a "crybaby"; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach Glen Sather to take the pressure off his players. Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not "staged". The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50 years.

Gretzky again acted as Executive Director of Canada's men's hockey team at the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin%2C%20Italy">Turin, Italy</a>, though not with the success of 2002; the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals and <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics">failed to win a medal</a>. He was asked to manage Canada's team at the 2005 <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">Ice Hockey World Championships</a>, but declined due to his mother's poor health.

Gretzky also served as an ambassador and contributor in Vancouver winning the <a href="Bids%20for%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">bidding process</a> to host the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>. He went to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, Czech Republic and was part of the presentation team.

Gretzky was the final Olympic torchbearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was one of four who lit the cauldron at <a href="BC%20Place%20Stadium">BC Place Stadium</a> during the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony">opening ceremony</a> (although one did not due to technical difficulties with one of the cauldron's "arms" which failed to rise) and then jogged out of the stadium, where he was then driven by police escorts through the streets of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outdoor cauldron near the <a href="Vancouver%20Convention%20Centre">Vancouver Convention Centre</a> located in the city's downtown waterfront district. Under <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">IOC</a> rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since the ceremony took place indoors. However, <a href="VANOC">VANOC</a> secretly built a second outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention Centre, and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron. Quickly word spread through the downtown Vancouver area that Gretzky was indeed the final torchbearer, and very soon a crush of people came running after the police escort to cheer Gretzky on and hopefully catch a glimpse of him carrying the torch to the outdoor cauldron. For the 2010 Winter Olympics, he was named Special Advisor to the Canada men's national ice hockey team.

Although Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any "old-timers exhibition games", on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice one last time to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary as an NHL team. The Heritage Classic, held at <a href="Commonwealth%20Stadium%20%28Edmonton%29">Commonwealth Stadium</a> in Edmonton, was the first regular season NHL game to be played outdoors. It was preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers%23Dynasty%20years%20%281983%E2%80%931990%29">Oiler Dynasty</a> teammates against a group of retired Montreal Canadiens players (whose likes included <a href="Claude%20Lemieux">Claude Lemieux</a>, <a href="Guy%20Lafleur">Guy Lafleur</a> and others). Despite frigid temperatures, the crowd numbered 57,167, with an additional several million watching the game on television.
The Edmonton alumni won the Megastars game 2–0, while Montreal went on to win the regular season game held later that day, 4–3.

In October 2016, Gretzky returned to the Oilers as a partner and vice-chairman of the team's parent company, <a href="Oilers%20Entertainment%20Group">Oilers Entertainment Group</a>. He will work closely with owner <a href="Daryl%20Katz">Daryl Katz</a> and Oilers Entertainment Group CEO Bob Nicholson on the business side of the Oilers' operation.

Gretzky has made several TV appearances, including as a "<a href="Dance%20Fever">Dance Fever</a>" celebrity judge, and an 'unforgettable appearance', acting in a dramatic role alongside Victor Newman in "<a href="The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless">The Young and the Restless</a>" in 1981. In 1984, he travelled to the Soviet Union to film a television program on Russian goaltender <a href="Vladislav%20Tretiak">Vladislav Tretiak</a>. Gretzky hosted the "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" comedy program in 1989. A fictional crime-fighting version of him served as one of the main characters in the cartoon "<a href="ProStars">ProStars</a>" in 1991. In December 2016, Gretzky appeared briefly in a cameo on a <a href="The%20Nightmare%20After%20Krustmas">Christmas episode</a> of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" as a winter character.

While serving as a judge on "Dance Fever", Gretzky met actress <a href="Janet%20Jones">Janet Jones</a>. According to Gretzky, Jones does not recall him being on the show. They met regularly after that, but did not become a couple until 1987 when they ran into each other at a <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> game that Gretzky and <a href="Alan%20Thicke">Alan Thicke</a> were attending. Gretzky proposed in January 1988, and they were married on July 16, 1988 in a lavish ceremony the Canadian press dubbed "The Royal Wedding". Broadcast live throughout Canada from <a href="St.%20Joseph%20Cathedral%20%28Edmonton%29">Edmonton's St. Joseph's Basilica</a>, members of the Fire Department acted as ceremonial guards. The event reportedly cost Gretzky over US$1 million.

He and Jones have five children: <a href="Paulina%20Gretzky">Paulina</a>, Ty, Trevor, Tristan, and Emma. Paulina and golfer <a href="Dustin%20Johnson">Dustin Johnson</a> announced their <a href="engagement">engagement</a> on August 18, 2013. Ty played hockey at <a href="Shattuck-Saint%20Mary%27s">Shattuck-Saint Mary's</a>, but quit the sport, and attended <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>. Trevor is a former minor league <a href="baseball">baseball</a> player.

Wayne Gretzky's uncle, Al Gretzky, ran as a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada">Conservative</a> candidate in <a href="London%20West">London West</a> in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006">2006 federal election</a> and for the <a href="libertarian">libertarian</a> <a href="Freedom%20Party%20of%20Ontario">Freedom Party of Ontario</a> in the 2013 provincial <a href="by-election">by-election</a> for the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a>. He was unsuccessful both times.

Gretzky has owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the <a href="Hull%20Olympiques">Hull Olympiques</a> of the <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a> for $175,000 CA. During his ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena. Gretzky eventually sold the team in 1992 for $550,000 CA.

In 1991, <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a> purchased the <a href="Toronto%20Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> (CFL) with Gretzky and <a href="John%20Candy">John Candy</a> as minority owners. The club won the <a href="Grey%20Cup">Grey Cup</a> championship in the first year of the partnership, but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the CFL corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names. In 1992, Gretzky and McNall partnered in an investment to buy a rare <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> <a href="T206">T206</a> <a href="cigarette%20card">cigarette card</a> for $451,000 US, later selling the card. It most recently sold for $2.8 million US. The pair also owned <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> race horses; one of them, <a href="Saumarez%20%28horse%29">Saumarez</a>, won France's <a href="Prix%20de%20l%27Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe</a> in 1990. Gretzky was a board member and executive officer of the Hespeler Hockey Company.

Gretzky's appeal as a product endorser far surpassed that of other hockey players of his era. By 1995, he was among the five highest-paid athlete endorsers in North America, with deals from <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a>, <a href="Domino%27s%20Pizza">Domino's Pizza</a>, <a href="Sharp%20Corporation">Sharp Corporation</a>, and <a href="Upper%20Deck%20Company">Upper Deck Company</a> among others. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" estimates that Gretzky made US$93.8 million from 1990 to 1998. He has endorsed and launched a wide variety of products, from pillow cases to insurance. Gretzky is a partner in First Team Sports, a maker of sports equipment and Worldwide Roller Hockey, Inc., an operator of roller hockey rinks. The video game brand <a href="EA%20Sports">EA Sports</a> included Gretzky in its 2010 title "<a href="NHL%20Slapshot">NHL Slapshot</a>", and he had previously been an endorser for the <a href="989%20Sports">989 Sports</a> games "<a href="Gretzky%20NHL%202005">Gretzky NHL 2005</a>" and "<a href="Gretzky%20NHL%202006">Gretzky NHL 2006</a>". Gretzky also made an appearance on the music video for <a href="Nickelback">Nickelback</a>'s "<a href="Rockstar%20%28Nickelback%20song%29">Rockstar</a>".

In 2017 as part-owner with Andrew Peller Ltd., Gretzky opened a <a href="winery">winery</a> and <a href="distillery">distillery</a> bearing the name of "Wayne Gretzky Estates" in <a href="Niagara-on-the-Lake">Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario</a>, and with products labeled by the <a href="trademark">trademark</a>, "No. 99". Since 1993, Gretzky and a business partner have operated the "Wayne Gretzky's" <a href="restaurant">restaurant</a> near the <a href="Rogers%20Centre">Rogers Centre</a> in downtown Toronto. Gretzky has other restaurants opened in 2016 at the <a href="Edmonton%20International%20Airport">Edmonton International Airport</a> and named "No. 99 Gretzky's Wine & Whisky", and in 2018 called "Studio 99" at <a href="Rogers%20Place">Rogers Place</a> in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>.

During the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%202015">2015 Canadian federal election campaign</a>, Gretzky endorsed the Conservative Party and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, and was featured at a campaign rally praising Harper by calling him "wonderful to the country." As a non-resident, Gretzky came under some criticism for this endorsement. In 2014, Gretzky praised Harper at a United for Ukraine Gala event in Toronto calling him "one of the greatest prime ministers ever". Earlier in 2015, Gretzky endorsed <a href="Patrick%20Brown%20%28politician%29">Patrick Brown</a> during his successful campaign for the <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario%20leadership%20election%2C%202015">leadership</a> of the <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario">Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario</a>.

In 2003, Gretzky praised <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and his <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> saying: "The president of the United States is a great leader, I happen to think he's a wonderful man and if he believes what he's doing in Iraq is right, I back him 100 per cent."

<a href="List%20of%20career%20achievements%20by%20Wayne%20Gretzky">Gretzky's career achievements</a> include many awards and honours. He won a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times.

Wolfenstein 3D

Wolfenstein 3D is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a> and published by <a href="3D%20Realms">Apogee Software</a> and <a href="FormGen">FormGen</a>. Originally released on May 5, 1992 for <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, it was inspired by the 1981 <a href="Muse%20Software">Muse Software</a> video game "<a href="Castle%20Wolfenstein">Castle Wolfenstein</a>", and is the third installment in the "<a href="Wolfenstein">Wolfenstein</a>" series. In "Wolfenstein 3D", the player <a href="player%20character">assumes the role</a> of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> spy <a href="William%20%26quot%3BB.J.%26quot%3B%20Blazkowicz">William "B.J." Blazkowicz</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as he escapes from the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> to find an elevator to the next level or kill a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">final boss</a>, fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns.

"Wolfenstein 3D" was the second major release by id Software, after the "<a href="Commander%20Keen">Commander Keen</a>" series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> experimented with making a fast 3D <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single <a href="plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a>, producing "<a href="Hovertank%203D">Hovertank 3D</a>" and "<a href="Catacomb%203-D">Catacomb 3-D</a>" as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly "Keen" to a more violent theme, programmer <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a> suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter "Castle Wolfenstein" as a fast-paced action game. He and designer <a href="Tom%20Hall">Tom Hall</a> designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. "Wolfenstein 3D" features artwork by <a href="Adrian%20Carmack">Adrian Carmack</a> and sound effects and music by <a href="Robert%20Prince%20%28video%20game%20composer%29">Bobby Prince</a>. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the <a href="shareware">shareware</a> model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, "Spear of Destiny", was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.

"Wolfenstein 3D" was a critical and commercial success, garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1993. It has been termed the "grandfather of 3D shooters", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the <a href="Wolfenstein%20%28series%29">"Wolfenstein" series</a> have been developed by other companies since 2001.

"Wolfenstein 3D" is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> presented with rudimentary <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a>. The game is broken up into <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height. Each level is themed after <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels—ten in the original episodes—are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss fight</a> with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health</a>. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire <a href="chain%20gun">chain gun</a>. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> graphics.

The player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one <a href="life%20%28gaming%29">life</a> and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its <a href="porting">ports</a> the player can only save between levels.

"Wolfenstein 3D" is divided into two sets of three episodes: "Escape from Castle Wolfenstein", "Operation: Eisenfaust", and "Die, Führer, Die!" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled "The Nocturnal Missions" including "A Dark Secret", "Trail of the Madman", and "Confrontation". The protagonist is <a href="William%20%26quot%3BB.J.%26quot%3B%20Blazkowicz">William "B.J." Blazkowicz</a>, an American spy of <a href="Polish%20Americans">Polish descent</a>, and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In "Escape", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. "Operation: Eisenfaust" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of <a href="undead">undead</a> mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in "Die, Führer, Die!" he infiltrates a <a href="F%C3%BChrerbunker">bunker</a> under the <a href="Reichstag%20building">Reichstag</a>, culminating in a battle with <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in a <a href="powered%20exoskeleton">robotic suit</a> equipped with four <a href="chain%20gun">chain gun</a>s.

"The Nocturnal Missions" form a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> storyline dealing with German plans for <a href="chemical%20warfare">chemical warfare</a>. "A Dark Secret" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. "Trail of the Madman" takes place in Castle <a href="Erlangen">Erlangen</a>, where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in "Confrontation", which is set in Castle <a href="Offenbach%20am%20Main">Offenbach</a> as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.

An additional episode, titled "Spear of Destiny", was released as a retail game by <a href="FormGen">FormGen</a>. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the <a href="Holy%20Lance">Spear of Destiny</a> from the Nazis after it was stolen from <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to <a href="German%20nuclear%20weapon%20project">build a nuclear weapon</a> or <a href="evocation">summon demons</a>.

In October–December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio <a href="Softdisk">Softdisk</a> calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Invasion%20of%20the%20Vorticons">Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons</a>", the first game in the "<a href="Commander%20Keen">Commander Keen</a>" series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a> developing games for the "Gamer's Edge" video game subscription service and <a href="disk%20magazine">disk magazine</a>, was composed of programmers <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a> and <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a>, designer <a href="Tom%20Hall">Tom Hall</a>, artist <a href="Adrian%20Carmack">Adrian Carmack</a>, and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through <a href="shareware">shareware</a> publisher <a href="3D%20Realms">Apogee Software</a>, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for "Gamer's Edge", one every two months.

Ideas from the Deep, now formally established as <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>, used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a>, which until then was largely the purview of <a href="amateur%20flight%20simulation">flight simulation games</a> such as "<a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28video%20game%29">Wing Commander</a>" (1990). Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast <a href="action%20game">action game</a> in 3D due to the <a href="rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">number of surfaces</a> it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through <a href="ray%20casting">ray casting</a>, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> that used animated 2D <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game "<a href="Hovertank%203D">Hovertank 3D</a>", in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a>, and he had largely finished the engine work for "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Goodbye%2C%20Galaxy">Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy</a>", Carmack decided to implement a feature from "", a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing game</a> in development by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Blue Sky Productions</a>. "Ultima Underworld" was planned to display <a href="texture%20mapping">texture-mapped</a> 3D graphics without "Hovertank"s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as "Underworld" was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from "Hovertank 3D" for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 "<a href="Catacomb%203-D">Catacomb 3-D</a>". Upon seeing it, <a href="Scott%20Miller%20%28entrepreneur%29">Scott Miller</a> of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.
In November 1991, with the second "Commander Keen" trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third "Keen" trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, "It's Green and Pissed", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 "<a href="Castle%20Wolfenstein">Castle Wolfenstein</a>". The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of "Keen" into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a "loud" and "cool" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay. He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.

Initially the team believed that they would be unable to use the "Wolfenstein" name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles. They contacted "Castle Wolfenstein" developer <a href="Silas%20Warner">Silas Warner</a>, but learned that <a href="Muse%20Software">Muse Software</a> and successor companies no longer existed and the trademark had lapsed, leaving them the option to use the name "Wolfenstein 3D". The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project. <a href="Mark%20Rein%20%28software%20executive%29">Mark Rein</a>, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail "Wolfenstein" project to <a href="FormGen">FormGen</a>, which had published id's December 1991 "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Aliens%20Ate%20My%20Babysitter">Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter</a>", overcoming the publisher's concerns over "Wolfenstein"s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.
Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be "to mow down Nazis", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood "like you never see in games", and straightforward, lethal weapons. Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items. Carmack programmed "the core" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the "Wolfenstein 3D" engine from "Catacomb 3-D", including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics. The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color <a href="Enhanced%20Graphics%20Adapter">EGA</a>, but were changed to 256 color <a href="VGA">VGA</a> four months before release. Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay. The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack. Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game. The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from "<a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>", and paid homage with a hidden "Pac-Man" level. The team ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by "Keen" composer <a href="Robert%20Prince%20%28video%20game%20composer%29">Bobby Prince</a> to make the guns sound exciting. With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, Bobby Prince composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to <a href="Foley%20%28filmmaking%29">Foley</a> sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.

As development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison <a href="Kevin%20Cloud">Kevin Cloud</a> as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to <a href="Mesquite%2C%20Texas">Mesquite, Texas</a>, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their <a href="royalty%20payment">royalty</a> rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, "ScubaVenture", so that id could focus on "Wolfenstein". The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire "Keen" series as well as several other games. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.

As the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added "<a href="Horst-Wessel-Lied">Horst-Wessel-Lied</a>", the anthem of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.

The following summer, most of the id Software team developed "Spear of Destiny", except John Carmack, who instead experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for "<a href="Shadowcaster">Shadowcaster</a>" and became the basis of the "Doom" engine. The one episode of "Spear of Destiny" was a prequel to "Wolfenstein 3D" and used the same engine, but added some new audio, graphics, and enemies. It took two months to create, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.

The first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as "Wolfenstein 3D", though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled "The Nocturnal Missions". Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game. In 1993 Apogee also published the "Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades" pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called "WolfMaster", along with a map editor titled "MapEdit" and a random level generator named "Wolf Creator". A retail "Wolfenstein" episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, "Spear of Destiny", was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge", each the same length as "Spear of Destiny", in May 1994, and later that year published "Spear of Destiny" and the two mission packs together as the "Spear of Destiny Super CD Package". Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through <a href="GT%20Interactive">GT Software</a> in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through <a href="Activision">Activision</a> in 1998.

There were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading "Call Apogee and say <a href="Aardwolf">Aardwolf</a>"; it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize, but the quick creation of level editors and <a href="cheating%20in%20video%20games">cheat</a> programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.

Since its initial release, "Wolfenstein 3D" has been ported to numerous other platforms. These include the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (1994), <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a> (1994), <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> (1994), <a href="Acorn%20Archimedes">Acorn Archimedes</a> (1994), <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO</a> (1995), and <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple IIGS</a> (1998). The Super NES and Jaguar ports were developed by id, while the rest were produced by other companies. Later releases include the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> (2002), <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>, and an <a href="iOS">iOS</a> version programmed by Carmack himself (2009). These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original—the Super NES version notably replaced the blood with sweat, dogs with rats, and removed all Nazi references, although the core gameplay and aesthetic are retained. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes "Spear of Destiny", and a 2007 <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes. <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a>, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of "Wolfenstein 3D"s release by producing a free-to-play <a href="browser%20game">browser-based</a> version of the game in 2012.

The Super NES port was completed in three weeks in March 1993 during the <a href="development%20of%20Doom">development of "Doom"</a>, after the contractor who had agreed to do the port proved to have made no progress. This version made use of <a href="binary%20space%20partitioning">binary space partitioning</a> rather than raycasting in order to give it speed. <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies. The port was initially going to have green blood, but the final version had no blood at all. Using the source code of the Super NES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a>. <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a> approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by <a href="Dave%20Taylor%20%28game%20programmer%29">Dave Taylor</a>, improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on. The SNES version was ported to Japan and released on February 10, 1994 under the name "Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust" before being ported back to North America and Europe a little later in 1994. In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed "Wolfenstein 3D" and converted it into a <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> arcade game. The Acorn Archimedes conversion was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software. By 1994, a port for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Mega Drive</a> was under development by <a href="Imagineer%20%28Japanese%20company%29">Imagineer</a>, who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems. An <a href="Atari%20Lynx">Atari Lynx</a> version of the game was offered earlier by Atari Corp. for id, but work on the port was never started due to an unrealized deal between the two companies. The 3DO version was released in October 1995 before being ported to Japan for release on December 15, 1995. The Apple IIGS port had been in development since Fall 1994 by programmer <a href="Rebecca%20Heineman">Bill Heineman</a> under the Vitesse company, but due to licensing problems, the game was not released until four years later and published by Logicware. The iOS port was done using the <a href="OpenGL">OpenGL</a> interface and coded in <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. The Android port was titled "Wolfenstein 3D Touch" and published by Beloko Games.

Id had no clear expectations for "Wolfenstein"s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" quoted a shareware distributor as saying "Wolfenstein 3D" was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of "Wolfenstein 3D" as well as "Spear of Destiny" had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as "Spear of Destiny"; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being <a href="Strafgesetzbuch%20section%2086a">banned from sale in Germany</a> due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the <a href="Federal%20Department%20for%20Media%20Harmful%20to%20Young%20Persons">Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons</a> in 1994, and again in 1997 for "Spear of Destiny". The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier "Commander Keen" series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where "Commander Keen" games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, "Wolfenstein 3D" brought in $200,000 per month.

"Wolfenstein 3D" won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from "<a href="Compute%21">Compute!</a>", the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from "<a href="VideoGames%20%26amp%3B%20Computer%20Entertainment">VideoGames & Computer Entertainment</a>", the 1992 Reader's Choice - Action/Arcade Game award from "Game Bytes", the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the <a href="Shareware%20Industry%20Awards">Shareware Industry Awards</a>, the 1993 Best Action Game award from "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", and a <a href="Software%20and%20Information%20Industry%20Association%23CODiE%20Awards">Codie award</a> from the <a href="Software%20Publishers%20Association">Software Publishers Association</a> for Best Action/Arcade Game. It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. "Wolfenstein 3D" was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>.

"Wolfenstein 3D" was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" praised the "sparse [but] gorgeous", "frighteningly realistic", and "extremely violent" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned "those sensitive to such things to stay home". Lombardi concluded that "Wolfenstein 3D", alongside "Ultima Underworld" released two months prior, was "the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief–suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment", stating that they knew of no other game that could "evoke such intense psychological responses from its players". "Wolfenstein" twice received 5 out of 5 stars in "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>" in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it "definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the "fast-paced action" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence. <a href="Sandy%20Petersen">Sandy Petersen</a>, in the first "Eye of the Monitor" column, claimed that "there is nothing else quite like "Wolfenstein"" and that it had "evolved almost beyond recognition" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it "a fun game with lots of action" and "a fun, fairly mindless romp", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard. The "Spear of Destiny" retail episode was also rated highly by "Computer Gaming World"s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes. Formgen's "Spear of Destiny" mission packs "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of "Computer Gaming World", who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.

The early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as "dismal". The four reviewers of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential. The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play. A "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying "Wolfenstein 3D" "set a new standard for PC gaming" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities. A "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games. Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that "there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive". Major Mike of "GamePro" commended the 3DO version's complete absence of <a href="pixelation">pixelation</a>, fast scaling, "rousing" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, "still packs a punch as a first-person shooter". "Wolfenstein 3D" won "GamePro"s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed "<a href="The%20Need%20for%20Speed">The Need for Speed</a>" and "<a href="D%20%28video%20game%29">D</a>". "Maximum", on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like "" and the PlayStation version of "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" that a new port was pointless, with the game now "somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive". A reviewer for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" asserted that "Wolfenstein 3D" was "still as <a href="video%20game%20addiction">addictive</a> as it ever was" but essentially agreed with "Maximum", contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or "moved on" to more advanced games in the genre. More modern reviews include one for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>", who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>", and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was "dated and flawed", it was "required playing for any first-person shooter fan".

"Wolfenstein 3D" has been called the "grandfather of 3D shooters", specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity. Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up%23Scrolling%20shooters">scrolling shooters</a>, while "Wolfenstein 3D" helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been attributed with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time; "VideoGames & Computer Entertainment" claimed in September 1992 that the game "justified the existence of shareware", and in July 1993 "Computer Gaming World" claimed that it "almost single-handedly" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters. The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.
During development, id approached <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra Entertainment</a>, then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing "Commander Keen" and an early version of "Wolfenstein 3D", CEO <a href="Ken%20Williams%20%28game%20developer%29">Ken Williams</a> offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of "Wolfenstein 3D" and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, "Doom", the success of "Wolfenstein 3D" led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down. In 1996, "Computer Gaming World" declared "Wolfenstein 3-D" the 97th-best computer game ever released.

The game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its <a href="Strafgesetzbuch%20section%2086a">"Strafgesetzbuch" section 86a</a> up through 2018. Section 86a had "social adequacy" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within "Wolfenstein 3D" determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, "this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas". Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the <a href="Unterhaltungssoftware%20Selbstkontrolle">Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle</a> (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. However, in August 2018, the decision was reversed by the German government, having determined that the "Wolfenstein 3D" decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.

After the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the "Commander Keen" engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the "Wolfenstein 3D" engine or derivatives of it include "", the <a href="Capstone%20Software">Capstone Software</a> games "" and "<a href="Operation%20Body%20Count">Operation Body Count</a>", as well as "<a href="Super%203D%20Noah%27s%20Ark">Super 3D Noah's Ark</a>". Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled "Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II", designed by Tom Hall using the "Wolfenstein 3D" engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Triad">Rise of the Triad</a>". Additionally, Softdisk produced "Catacomb Abyss" using the prototype "Wolfenstein 3D" engine from "Catacomb 3-D" as part of the "<a href="Catacomb%203-D%23Catacomb%20Adventure%20Series">Catacomb Adventure Series</a>" trilogy of sequels. Although "Wolfenstein 3D" was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content. John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others. The modding efforts of "Wolfenstein" players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like "Doom" and "<a href="Quake%20%28video%20game%29">Quake</a>" to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games. The source code for the original "Wolfenstein 3D" engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release. The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as "<a href="Ken%27s%20Labyrinth">Ken's Labyrinth</a>", "<a href="Nitemare%203D">Nitemare 3D</a>", "", "<a href="Pie%20in%20the%20Sky%20%28game%20engine%29%23Terminal%20Terror">Terminal Terror</a>" and "<a href="The%20Fortress%20of%20Dr.%20Radiaki">The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki</a>", among others.

Although id Software did not develop another "Wolfenstein" game, as their development focus shifted to "Doom" shortly after release, and has never returned to the series, multiple "Wolfenstein" titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer "Wolfenstein" games was "<a href="Return%20to%20Castle%20Wolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>" in 2001, a <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> of the series, and the latest is the 2017 "".

William McKinley

William McKinley (January 29, 1843 – September 14, 1901) was the 25th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a>, serving from March 4, 1897, until <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">his assassination</a> six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, raised <a href="protective%20tariff">protective tariff</a>s to promote American industry and kept the nation on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> in a rejection of <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> (effectively, expansionary <a href="monetary%20policy">monetary policy</a>).

McKinley was the last president to have served in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and the only one to have started the war as an <a href="enlisted%20soldier">enlisted soldier</a>, beginning as a private in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> and ending as a <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> major. After the war, he settled in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>, where he practiced law and married <a href="Ida%20Saxton">Ida Saxton</a>. In 1876, he was elected to <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>, where he became the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>'s expert on the <a href="protective%20tariff">protective tariff</a>, which he promised would bring prosperity. His 1890 <a href="McKinley%20Tariff">McKinley Tariff</a> was highly controversial, which together with a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> redistricting aimed at <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> him out of office led to his defeat in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201890">Democratic landslide of 1890</a>. He was elected <a href="governor%20of%20Ohio">governor of Ohio</a> in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests. With the aid of his close adviser <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, he <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896</a> amid a deep economic depression. He defeated his Democratic rival <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> after a <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> in which he advocated "<a href="sound%20money">sound money</a>" (the gold standard unless altered by international agreement) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity.

Rapid economic growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 <a href="Dingley%20Tariff">Dingley Tariff</a> to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 secured the passage of the <a href="Gold%20Standard%20Act">Gold Standard Act</a>. McKinley hoped to persuade <a href="Spain">Spain</a> to grant independence to rebellious <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Cuba">Cuba</a> without conflict, but when negotiation failed he led the nation into the Spanish–American War of 1898"—"the United States victory was quick and decisive. As part of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281898%29">the peace settlement</a>, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Government%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Islands">Philippines</a> while <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Government%20in%20Cuba">Cuba</a> was promised independence, but at that time remained under the control of the United States Army. The United States <a href="Annexation%20of%20Hawaii">annexed</a> the independent <a href="Republic%20of%20Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a> in 1898 and it became a <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">United States territory</a>.

Historians regard McKinley's 1896 victory as a <a href="realigning%20election">realigning election</a> in which <a href="Third%20Party%20System">the political stalemate</a> of the post-Civil War era gave way to the Republican-dominated <a href="Fourth%20Party%20System">Fourth Party System</a>, which began with the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a>. McKinley defeated Bryan again in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">1900 presidential election</a> in a campaign focused on <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>, <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> and free silver. His legacy was suddenly cut short when he was shot on September 6, 1901 by <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a>, a second-generation <a href="Polish-American">Polish-American</a> with <a href="Anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anarchist</a> leanings. McKinley died eight days later and was succeeded by his Vice President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. As an innovator of American <a href="Interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionism</a> and pro-business sentiment, McKinley's presidency is <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">generally considered above average</a>, though his highly positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt.

William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a>, the seventh of nine children of <a href="William%20McKinley%20Sr.">William McKinley Sr.</a> and Nancy (née Allison) McKinley (1809–1897). The McKinleys were of <a href="English%20Americans">English</a> and <a href="Scotch-Irish%20Americans">Scots-Irish</a> descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in <a href="Dervock">Dervock</a>, <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, in present-day <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. There, the elder McKinley was born in <a href="Pine%20Township%2C%20Mercer%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pine Township, Mercer County</a>.

The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in <a href="Lisbon%2C%20Ohio">New Lisbon</a> (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated <a href="Foundry">foundries</a> throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, <a href="Poland%2C%20Ohio">Poland</a>, and finally <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton</a>. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's <a href="Connecticut%20Western%20Reserve">Western Reserve</a>, steeped in <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whiggish</a> and <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist</a> beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in <a href="First%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Canton%2C%20Ohio%29">the local Methodist church</a> at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.

In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from <a href="Poland%20Seminary">Poland Seminary</a> in 1859, he enrolled the following year at <a href="Allegheny%20College">Allegheny College</a> in <a href="Meadville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Meadville, Pennsylvania</a>. He was an honorary member of the <a href="Sigma%20Alpha%20Epsilon">Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at <a href="Mount%20Union%20College">Mount Union College</a> in <a href="Alliance%2C%20Ohio">Alliance, Ohio</a> as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.

When the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern states</a> seceded from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the American Civil War began, thousands of men in Ohio volunteered for service. Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne, who enlisted as <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">privates</a> in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861. The men left for <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus</a> where they were consolidated with other small units to form the <a href="23rd%20Ohio%20Infantry">23rd Ohio Infantry</a>. The men were unhappy to learn that, unlike Ohio's earlier volunteer <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s, they would not be permitted to elect their officers; they would be designated by Ohio's governor, <a href="William%20Dennison%20Jr.">William Dennison</a>. Dennison appointed <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a> as the commander of the regiment, and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus. McKinley quickly took to the soldier's life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling <a href="Union%20Army">the army</a> and the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union cause</a>. Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers, but <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> convinced them to accept what the government had issued them; his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley, beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes's death in 1893.

After a month of training, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio, now led by Colonel <a href="Eliakim%20P.%20Scammon">Eliakim P. Scammon</a>, set out for western Virginia (today part of West Virginia) in July 1861 as a part of the <a href="Kanawha%20Division">Kanawha Division</a>. McKinley initially thought Scammon was a <a href="martinet">martinet</a>, but when the regiment finally saw battle, he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling. Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at <a href="Battle%20of%20Carnifex%20Ferry">Carnifex Ferry</a> in present-day West Virginia. Three days after the battle, McKinley was assigned to duty in the <a href="brigade">brigade</a> <a href="Quartermaster%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">quartermaster</a> office, where he worked both to supply his regiment, and as a clerk. In November, the regiment established winter quarters near <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20West%20Virginia">Fayetteville</a> (today in West Virginia). McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> who was ill, and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank. The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command (Scammon by then led the brigade) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces.

That September, McKinley's regiment was called east to reinforce General <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a> at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>. Delayed in passing through Washington, D.C., the 23rd Ohio did not arrive in time for the battle but joined the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> as it hurried north to cut off <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> as it advanced into Maryland. The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the <a href="Battle%20of%20South%20Mountain">Battle of South Mountain</a> on September 14. After severe losses, Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg</a>, Maryland, where they engaged Lee's army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at Antietam, and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line. McKinley's regiment again suffered many casualties, but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia. The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia.

While the regiment went into winter quarters near <a href="Charleston%2C%20West%20Virginia">Charleston, Virginia</a> (present-day West Virginia), McKinley was ordered back to Ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops. When they arrived in Columbus, Governor <a href="David%20Tod">David Tod</a> surprised McKinley with a commission as <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in recognition of his service at Antietam. McKinley and his comrades saw little action until July 1863, when the division skirmished with <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a>'s cavalry at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buffington%20Island">Battle of Buffington Island</a>. Early in 1864, the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized, and the division was assigned to <a href="George%20Crook">George Crook</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20West%20Virginia">Army of West Virginia</a>. They soon resumed the offensive, marching into southwestern Virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by the enemy. On May 9, the army engaged Confederate troops at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cloyd%27s%20Mountain">Cloyd's Mountain</a>, where the men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field. McKinley later said the combat there was "as desperate as any witnessed during the war". Following the rout, the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully.

McKinley and his regiment moved to the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> as the armies broke from winter quarters to <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">resume hostilities</a>. Crook's corps was attached to <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="David%20Hunter">David Hunter</a>'s <a href="Union%20Army%20of%20the%20Shenandoah">Army of the Shenandoah</a> and soon back in contact with Confederate forces, capturing <a href="Lexington%2C%20Virginia">Lexington, Virginia</a>, on June 11. They continued south toward <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg</a>, tearing up railroad track as they advanced. Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful, however, and the brigade returned to West Virginia. Before the army could make another attempt, Confederate General <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north. Early's army surprised them at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kernstown">Kernstown</a> on July 24, where McKinley came under heavy fire and the army was defeated. Retreating into Maryland, the army was reorganized again: Major General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> replaced Hunter, and McKinley, who had been promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a> after the battle, was transferred to General Crook's staff. By August, Early was retreating south in the valley, with Sheridan's army in pursuit. They fended off a Confederate assault at <a href="Battle%20of%20Berryville">Berryville</a>, where McKinley had a horse shot out from under him, and advanced to <a href="Battle%20of%20Opequon">Opequon Creek</a>, where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south. They followed up the victory with another at <a href="Battle%20of%20Fisher%27s%20Hill">Fisher's Hill</a> on September 22 and were engaged once more at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cedar%20Creek">Cedar Creek</a> on October 19. After initially falling back from the Confederate advance, McKinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle.

After Cedar Creek, the army stayed in the vicinity through election day, when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot, for the incumbent Republican, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. The next day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was captured by Confederate raiders. Crook's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign, and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days—Crook, <a href="John%20Dunlap%20Stevenson">John D. Stevenson</a>, <a href="Samuel%20S.%20Carroll">Samuel S. Carroll</a>, and <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield S. Hancock</a>. Finally assigned to Carroll's staff again, McKinley acted as the general's first and only <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>. Lee and his army <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House%23Surrender">surrendered</a> to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> a few days later, effectively ending the war. McKinley found time to join a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> lodge (later renamed after him) in <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester, Virginia</a> before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties. Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.
On March 7, 1883, McKinley was elected as a First Class Companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20the%20Loyal%20Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States</a> (MOLLUS)—a military society of officers who served in the Union armed forces during the American Civil War and their descendants. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 3029.

McKinley, along with Samuel M. Taylor and James C. Howe, co-authored and published a twelve-volume work, "Official Roster of the Soldiers of the State of Ohio in the War of the Rebellion, 1861–1866" published in 1886.

After the war ended in 1865, McKinley decided on a career in the law and began <a href="Reading%20law">studying</a> in the office of an attorney in <a href="Poland%2C%20Ohio">Poland, Ohio</a>. The following year, he continued his studies by attending <a href="Albany%20Law%20School">Albany Law School</a> in New York. After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in <a href="Warren%2C%20Ohio">Warren, Ohio</a>, in March 1867. That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of <a href="Stark%20County%2C%20Ohio">Stark County</a>, and set up a small office. He soon formed a partnership with <a href="George%20W.%20Belden">George W. Belden</a>, an experienced lawyer and former judge. His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton, which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come. When his Army friend <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> was nominated for governor in 1867, McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County, his first foray into politics. The county was closely divided between <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> and <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory. In 1869, McKinley ran for the office of <a href="District%20attorney">prosecuting attorney</a> of Stark County, an office usually then held by Democrats, and was unexpectedly elected. When McKinley ran for re-election in 1871, the Democrats nominated <a href="William%20A.%20Lynch">William A. Lynch</a>, a prominent local lawyer, and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes.

As McKinley's professional career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed <a href="Ida%20Saxton%20McKinley">Ida Saxton</a>, the daughter of a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, <a href="Katherine%20McKinley">Katherine</a>, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife descended into a deep depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys had no more children. Ida McKinley developed <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife's medical and emotional needs for the rest of his life.

Ida McKinley insisted that William continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a <a href="Coal%20miners%27%20strike%20of%201873%23Aftermath">group of striking coal miners</a> arrested for rioting after a clash with <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, <a href="William%20R.%20Day">William R. Day</a>, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, a <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> businessman. Taking the case "<a href="pro%20bono">pro bono</a>," he was successful in getting all but one of the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.

McKinley's good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for <a href="Ohio%27s%2017th%20congressional%20district">Ohio's 17th congressional district</a>. Delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract <a href="Blue-collar%20worker">blue-collar</a> voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a <a href="Tariff">protective tariff</a>, defeated the Democratic nominee, <a href="Levi%20L.%20Lamborn">Levi L. Lamborn</a>, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">a hotly disputed election</a> to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.

McKinley first took his congressional seat in October 1877, when <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">President Hayes</a> summoned Congress into special session. With the Republicans in the minority, McKinley was given unimportant committee assignments, which he undertook conscientiously. McKinley's friendship with Hayes did McKinley little good on <a href="Capitol%20Hill">Capitol Hill</a>; the President was not well-regarded by many leaders there. The young congressman broke with Hayes on the question of the currency, but it did not affect their friendship. The United States had effectively been placed on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> by the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>; when silver prices dropped significantly, many sought to make silver again a legal tender, equally with gold. Such a course would be inflationary, but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a> would be worth the inflation; opponents warned that "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>" would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade. McKinley voted for the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a> of 1878, which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money, and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes' veto of the legislation. In so doing, McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader, his fellow Ohioan and friend, <a href="James%20Garfield">James Garfield</a>.

From his first term in Congress, McKinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer <a href="Margaret%20Leech">Margaret Leech</a> noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of <a href="protectionism">protection</a>, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">House Ways and Means Committee</a>; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.

McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>. In 1884, he was elected a delegate to <a href="1884%20Republican%20National%20Convention">that year's Republican convention</a>, where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, and Governor <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a> were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, as well as those of Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the <a href="1888%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1888 Republican National Convention</a>, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, <a href="Maine">Maine</a> Senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> senator <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.

In 1889, with the Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought election as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>. He failed to gain the post, which went to <a href="Thomas%20Brackett%20Reed">Thomas B. Reed</a> of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the <a href="McKinley%20Tariff">McKinley Tariff</a> of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.

Recognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to <a href="Gerrymandering">gerrymander</a> or redistrict him out of office. In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, "Oh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! We enjoyed it as much as he did." After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote. Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.
For 1890, the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time, placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro-Democrat counties, <a href="Holmes%20County%2C%20Ohio">Holmes</a>, populated by solidly Democratic <a href="Pennsylvania%20Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a>. The new boundaries seemed good, based on past results, for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000. The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891, but they could throw all their energies into the district, as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide, and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley's race. The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton, including Blaine (then <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>), Speaker Reed and President Harrison. The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues. McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district, reaching out to its 40,000 voters to explain that his tariff

Democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor <a href="John%20G.%20Warwick">John G. Warwick</a>. To drive their point home, they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.

Even before McKinley completed his term in Congress, he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor. Governor <a href="James%20E.%20Campbell">James E. Campbell</a>, a Democrat, who had defeated <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Foraker</a> in 1889, was to seek re-election in 1891. The Ohio Republican party remained divided, but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention, which chose McKinley by acclamation. The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell, beginning in his birthplace of Niles. Hanna, however, was little seen in the campaign; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election. McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20,000 votes; the following January, Sherman, with considerable assistance from Hanna, turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature's vote for another term in the Senate.

Ohio's governor had relatively little power—for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it—but with Ohio a key <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, its governor was a major figure in national politics. Although McKinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor. He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union.

<a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">President Harrison</a> had proven unpopular; there were divisions even within the Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared Republican candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of <a href="1892%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word he did not want to be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201892">the November election</a>. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.

Soon after Cleveland's return to office, hard times struck the nation with the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. A businessman in <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown</a>, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept track of what he was signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher <a href="H.%20H.%20Kohlsaat">H. H. Kohlsaat</a>, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.

McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded with the election in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, <a href="Asa%20S.%20Bushnell%20%28Governor%29">Asa Bushnell</a>, and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.

It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president. As Phillips notes, "no documents, no diaries, no confidential letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems." From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, "what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House." Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.

Backed by Hanna's money and organizational skills, McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896. When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> Senator <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a> sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies, they found that Hanna's agents had preceded them. According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election,

Hanna, on McKinley's behalf, met with the eastern Republican <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a>es, such as Senators <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas Platt</a> of New York and <a href="Matthew%20Quay">Matthew Quay</a> of Pennsylvania, who were willing to guarantee McKinley's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices. McKinley, however, was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals, and Hanna accepted that decision. Many of their early efforts were focused on the South; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region. McKinley needed 453½ delegate votes to gain the nomination; he gained nearly half that number from the South and <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a>. Platt lamented in his memoirs, "[Hanna] had the South practically solid before some of us awakened."
The bosses still hoped to deny McKinley a first-ballot majority at <a href="1896%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> by boosting support for local <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidates such as Quay, New York Governor (and former vice president) <a href="Levi%20P.%20Morton">Levi P. Morton</a>, and Illinois Senator <a href="Shelby%20Cullom">Shelby Cullom</a>. Delegate-rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground, as McKinley supporters, such as Chicago businessman (and future vice president) <a href="Charles%20G.%20Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a>, sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis. Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines; at the state convention at the end of April, McKinley completed a near-sweep of Illinois' delegates. Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination, the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly. Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley. Wyoming Senator <a href="Francis%20Warren">Francis Warren</a> wrote, "The politicians are making a hard fight against him, but if the masses could speak, McKinley is the choice of at least 75% of the entire [body of] Republican voters in the Union".

By the time the national convention began in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> on June 16, 1896, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates. The former governor, who remained in Canton, followed events at the convention closely by telephone, and was able to hear part of Foraker's speech nominating him over the line. When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states, its votes gave McKinley the nomination, which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house, anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate's home. Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch. The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman <a href="Garret%20Hobart">Garret Hobart</a> of New Jersey for vice president, a choice actually made, by most accounts, by Hanna. Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer <a href="Herbert%20Croly">Herbert Croly</a> pointed out, "if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it".

Before the Republican convention, McKinley had been a "straddle bug" on the currency question, favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> by international agreement. In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> by international agreement. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Teller">Henry M. Teller</a>, to walk out of the convention. However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.

The bad economic times had continued, and strengthened the hand of forces for <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> and chose <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> for president; he had electrified the delegates with his <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.

<a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">Bryan's campaign</a> had at most an estimated $500,000. With his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race, Bryan decided on a <a href="Whistle%20stop%20train%20tour">whistle-stop</a> political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour with one of his own; the candidate declined on the grounds that the Democrat was a better stump speaker: "I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to "think" when I speak." Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's '<a href="front%20porch%20campaign">Front Porch Campaign</a>' became a legend in American political history."
McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday, receiving delegations from the front porch of his home. The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates—the pro-silver <a href="Cleveland%20Plain%20Dealer">Cleveland "Plain Dealer"</a> disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made "cheaper than staying at home". Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley's home on North Market Street. Once there, they crowded close to the front porch—from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs—as their spokesman addressed McKinley. The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884%23Campaign">had happened to Blaine in 1884</a>.

Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan, the major exception being the New York "Journal", controlled by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, whose fortune was based on silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of <a href="Homer%20Davenport">Homer Davenport</a>, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business. Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk.

The Democrats had pamphlets too, though not as many. Jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties:

McKinley always though of himself as a "tariff man" and expected that the rival monetary issues would fade away in a month. He was quite mistaken—silver and gold dominated the campaign.

The battleground proved to be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was considered most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado.

The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a <a href="realigning%20election">realigning election</a>, in which McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. The voting patterns established then displaced the near-deadlock the major parties had seen since the Civil War; the Republican dominance begun then would continue <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201932">until 1932</a>, another realigning election with the ascent of <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>. Phillips argues that, with the possible exception of Iowa Senator Allison, McKinley was the only Republican who could have defeated Bryan—he theorized that eastern candidates such as Morton or Reed would have done badly against the Illinois-born Bryan in the crucial Midwest. According to the biographer, though Bryan was popular among rural voters, "McKinley appealed to a very different industrialized, urbanized America."

McKinley was <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20William%20McKinley">sworn in as president</a> on March 4, 1897, as his wife and mother looked on. The new President gave a lengthy inaugural address; he urged tariff reform, and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation. He warned against foreign interventions, "We want no wars of conquest. We must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression."

McKinley's most controversial Cabinet appointment was that of John Sherman as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities. McKinley needed to have Hanna appointed to the Senate so Senator Sherman was moved up. Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley did not believe the rumors. Nevertheless, McKinley sent his cousin, William McKinley Osborne, to have dinner with the 73-year-old senator; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever. McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced, "the stories regarding Senator Sherman's 'mental decay' are without foundation ... When I saw him last I was convinced both of his perfect health, physically and mentally, and that the prospects of life were remarkably good."

Maine Representative <a href="Nelson%20Dingley%20Jr.">Nelson Dingley Jr.</a> was McKinley's choice for Secretary of the Treasury; he declined it, preferring to remain as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Currency">Comptroller of the Currency</a>; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, <a href="Lyman%20J.%20Gage">Lyman J. Gage</a>, president of the <a href="First%20Chicago%20Bank">First National Bank of Chicago</a> and a <a href="Gold%20Democrat">Gold Democrat</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Department</a> was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman <a href="John%20Davis%20Long">John Davis Long</a>, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, "I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody." Nevertheless, he made the appointment.

In addition to Sherman, McKinley made one other ill-advised Cabinet appointment, that of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, which fell to <a href="Russell%20A.%20Alger">Russell A. Alger</a>, former general and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> governor. Competent enough in peacetime, Alger proved inadequate once the conflict with Spain began. With the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> plagued by scandal, Alger resigned at McKinley's request in mid-1899. Vice President Hobart, as was customary at the time, was not invited to Cabinet meetings. However, he proved a valuable adviser both for McKinley and for his Cabinet members. The wealthy Vice President leased a residence close to the White House; the two families visited each other without formality, and the Vice President's wife, <a href="Jennie%20Tuttle%20Hobart">Jennie Tuttle Hobart</a>, sometimes substituted as Executive Mansion hostess when Ida McKinley was unwell. For most of McKinley's administration, <a href="George%20B.%20Cortelyou">George B. Cortelyou</a> served as <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">his personal secretary</a>. Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Theodore Roosevelt, became a combination <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Secretary">press secretary</a> and <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">chief of staff</a> to McKinley.

For decades, rebels in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded to a <a href="Cuban%20War%20of%20Independence">war for Cuban independence</a>. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, or at least to allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.

In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a> <a href="Fitzhugh%20Lee">Fitzhugh Lee</a> reported riots in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, McKinley agreed to send the battleship <a href="USS%20Maine%20%28ACR-1%29">USS "Maine"</a> there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the "Maine" exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public attention focused on the crisis and the consensus was that regardless of who set the bomb, Spain had lost control over Cuba. McKinley insisted that a <a href="Naval%20Board%20of%20Inquiry">court of inquiry</a> first determine whether the explosion was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, the court ruled that the "Maine" was blown up by an <a href="Naval%20mine">underwater mine</a>. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the <a href="Teller%20Amendment">Teller Amendment</a>, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.

The expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements as far as he was able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Army's commanding general, <a href="Nelson%20A.%20Miles">Nelson A. Miles</a>. Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General <a href="John%20Schofield">John Schofield</a>, and later from <a href="Adjutant%20general%23United%20States">Adjutant General</a> <a href="Henry%20Clarke%20Corbin">Henry Clarke Corbin</a>. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.

Within a fortnight, the navy had its first victory when the <a href="Asiatic%20Squadron">Asiatic Squadron</a>, led by <a href="Commodore%20%28United%20States%29">Commodore</a> <a href="George%20Dewey">George Dewey</a>, destroyed the Spanish navy at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manila%20Bay">Battle of Manila Bay</a> in the Philippines. Dewey's overwhelming victory expanded the scope of the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain's Pacific colonies. The next month, he increased the number of <a href="Eighth%20Army%20Corps%20%28Spanish-American%20War%29">troops sent to the Philippines</a> and granted the force's commander, Major General <a href="Wesley%20Merritt">Wesley Merritt</a>, the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation. By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898, McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States. He professed to be open to all views on the subject; however, he believed that as the war progressed, the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war.

Meanwhile, in the Caribbean theater, a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, for an invasion of Cuba. The army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for Cuba, but by June, Corbin had made progress in resolving the problems. After lengthy delays, the army, led by Major General <a href="William%20Rufus%20Shafter">William Rufus Shafter</a>, sailed from Florida on June 20, landing near <a href="Santiago%20de%20Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> two days later. Following a skirmish at <a href="Battle%20of%20Las%20Guasimas">Las Guasimas</a> on June 24, Shafter's army engaged the Spanish forces on July 2 in the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Juan%20Hill">Battle of San Juan Hill</a>. In an intense day-long battle, the American force was victorious, although both sides suffered heavy casualties. The next day, the Spanish Caribbean squadron, which had been sheltering in Santiago's harbor, broke for the open sea but was intercepted and destroyed by <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20T.%20Sampson">William T. Sampson</a>'s North Atlantic Squadron in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Santiago%20de%20Cuba">largest naval battle of the war</a>. Shafter laid siege to the city of Santiago, which surrendered on July 17, placing Cuba under effective American control. McKinley and Miles also ordered an invasion of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, which met little resistance when it landed in July. The distance from Spain and the destruction of the Spanish navy made resupply impossible, and the Spanish government began to look for a way to end the war.

McKinley's cabinet agreed with him that Spain must leave Cuba and Puerto Rico, but they disagreed on the Philippines, with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area. Although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of the Philippines, several prominent political leaders—including Democrats Bryan, and Cleveland, and the newly formed <a href="American%20Anti-Imperialist%20League">American Anti-Imperialist League</a>—made their opposition known.

McKinley proposed to open negotiations with Spain on the basis of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281898%29">Treaty of Paris</a> was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ). McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.

During the war, McKinley also pursued the annexation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a>. The new republic, dominated by business interests, <a href="Overthrow%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself</a>. There was strong American support for annexation, and the need for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative <a href="Francis%20G.%20Newlands">Francis G. Newlands</a> of Nevada to accomplish the result by <a href="joint%20resolution">joint resolution</a> of both houses of Congress. The resulting <a href="Newlands%20Resolution">Newlands Resolution</a> passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing ... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is <a href="manifest%20destiny">manifest destiny</a>."

Even before peace negotiations began with Spain, McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in Asia and espoused an "<a href="Open%20Door%20Policy">Open Door Policy</a>", in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nation's territorial integrity.

American missionaries were threatened with death when the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in <a href="Peking">Peking</a> were besieged and, in cooperation with other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the <a href="China%20Relief%20Expedition">China Relief Expedition</a>. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.

Closer to home, McKinley and Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The <a href="Clayton%E2%80%93Bulwer%20Treaty">Clayton–Bulwer Treaty</a>, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, <a href="Julian%20Pauncefote%2C%201st%20Baron%20Pauncefote">Julian Pauncefote</a>, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and <a href="Hay%E2%80%93Pauncefote%20Treaty">a new treaty</a> was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.

McKinley had built his reputation in Congress on high tariffs, promising protection for American business and well-paid American factory workers. With the Republicans in control of Congress, Ways and Means chairman Dingley introduced the <a href="Dingley%20Act">Dingley Act</a> which would raise rates on wool, sugar, and luxury goods. McKinley supported it and it became law.

American negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with France, and the two nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a>. The Prime Minister, <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, <a href="Edward%20O.%20Wolcott">Edward O. Wolcott</a>, that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in <a href="India">India</a> to silver coinage if the <a href="Viceroy%27s%20Executive%20Council">Viceroy's Executive Council</a> there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Yukon</a> and <a href="Australian%20gold%20rushes">Australia</a> increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the <a href="Gold%20Standard%20Act">Gold Standard Act</a> on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.

In the wake of McKinley's election in 1896, <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against <a href="lynching">lynching</a> while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending <a href="sectionalism">sectionalism</a>, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. <a href="Blanche%20Bruce">Blanche K. Bruce</a>, an African American who during <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> had served as senator from <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint <a href="George%20B.%20Jackson">George B. Jackson</a>, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in <a href="Presidio%2C%20Texas">Presidio, Texas</a>. However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.

The administration's response to racial violence was minimal, causing him to lose black support. When black postmasters at <a href="Hogansville%2C%20Georgia">Hogansville, Georgia</a> in 1897, and at <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20South%20Carolina">Lake City, South Carolina</a> the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.

According to historian Clarance A. Bacote, "Before the Spanish–American War, the Negroes, in spite of some mistakes, regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had." Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. McKinley toured the South in late 1898, promoting sectional reconciliation. He visited <a href="Tuskegee%20Institute">Tuskegee Institute</a> and black educator <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a>. He also visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence. Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the President's words and actions. Gould concluded regarding race, "McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans".

Republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a>, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and <a href="Cornelius%20Newton%20Bliss">Cornelius N. Bliss</a>, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. After a stint as <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</a>, Roosevelt had resigned and raised <a href="Rough%20Riders">a cavalry regiment</a>; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a> and New York Senator <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a>, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.

When the <a href="1900%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican convention</a> began in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> that June, no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The <a href="1900%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic convention</a> convened the next month in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a> and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.

The candidates were the same, but the issues of the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a <a href="Coal%20strike%20of%201902%23The%201899%20and%201900%20strikes">coal miners strike in Pennsylvania</a>. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the <a href="solid%20South">solid South</a>, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.

Soon after <a href="Second%20inauguration%20of%20William%20McKinley">his second inauguration</a> on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley undertook a six-week tour of the nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the <a href="Pan-American%20Exposition">Pan-American Exposition</a> in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.

Although McKinley enjoyed meeting the public, Cortelyou was concerned with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a> the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.

One man in the crowd, <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a>, hoped to assassinate McKinley. He had managed to get close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, uncertain of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the <a href="Temple%20of%20Music">Temple of Music</a> on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.

McKinley urged his aides to break the news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a primitive <a href="X-ray%20machine">X-ray machine</a> was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.

In the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve. Doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins. Members of the Cabinet, who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news, dispersed; Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the <a href="Adirondacks">Adirondacks</a>. Leech wrote, 

On the morning of September 13, McKinley's condition deteriorated. Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. Unknown to the doctors, the <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a> that would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach, slowly poisoning his blood. McKinley drifted in and out of consciousness all day; when awake he was the model patient. By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." Relatives and friends gathered around the death bed. The First Lady sobbed over him, "I want to go, too. I want to go, too." Her husband replied, "We are all going, we are all going. God's will be done, not ours" and with final strength put an arm around her. He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, "<a href="Nearer%2C%20My%20God%2C%20to%20Thee">Nearer, My God, to Thee</a>", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him.
At 2:15 a.m. on September 14, President McKinley died. Theodore Roosevelt had rushed back to Buffalo and took the oath of office as president. Czolgosz, put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley's death, was found guilty, sentenced to death on September 26, and executed by <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a> on October 29, 1901.

According to Gould, "The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing." The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline—almost unnoticed in the mourning. The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it first lay in the <a href="East%20Room">East Room</a> of the Executive Mansion, and then <a href="Lying%20in%20state%23United%20States">in state</a> in the Capitol, and then was taken to Canton. A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the <a href="Capitol%20Rotunda">Capitol Rotunda</a>, many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects. It was then transported to the receiving vault at <a href="West%20Lawn%20Cemetery">West Lawn Cemetery</a> in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned.

There was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, that they should be prepared for a double funeral. This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love". She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907. She died only months before the completion of <a href="McKinley%20National%20Memorial">the large marble monument</a> to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.

In addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley. There is the "<a href="William%20McKinley%20Monument">William McKinley Monument</a>" in front of the <a href="Ohio%20Statehouse">Ohio Statehouse</a> in Columbus, Ohio and <a href="National%20McKinley%20Birthplace%20Memorial">a monument at his birthplace</a> in Niles; 20 Ohio schools bear his name. There are several schools in the United States named <a href="McKinley%20School%20%28disambiguation%29">McKinley School</a>. Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death. Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents. Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries. McKinley's name is also used in the large inner-city Honolulu, Hawaii high school, <a href="President%20William%20McKinley%20High%20School">President William McKinley High School</a>.

In 1896, a gold prospector gave McKinley's name to <a href="Denali">Denali</a>, the tallest mountain in North America at . The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain back to Denali in 1975, which is what it was called by locals. The <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a> followed suit in August 2015 as a part of a visit to Alaska by President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. Similarly, <a href="Denali%20National%20Park">Denali National Park</a> was known as Mount McKinley National Park until December 2, 1980, when it was changed by legislation signed by President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>.

McKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history. However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor's death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinley's administration was deemed no more than "a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt's". Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland. Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley's presidency profoundly affected the nation's future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinley's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.

There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the <a href="Third%20Party%20System">Third</a> and <a href="Fourth%20Party%20System">Fourth Party System</a>s. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people. Republican <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a> exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s—a realignment that did not happen. Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Phillips writes that McKinley's low rating is undeserved, and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Coolidge</a>. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, whom Roosevelt elevated to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> where he remained nearly twenty years, and <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, whom McKinley had made <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a> and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.

A controversial aspect of McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of <a href="American%20imperialism">American empire</a>. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.

Morgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades:

William Howard Taft

William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) was the 27th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> (1909–1913) and the tenth <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">chief justice of the United States</a> (1921–1930), the only person to have held both offices. Taft was elected president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201908">1908</a>, the chosen successor of <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, but was defeated for re-election by <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201912">1912</a> after Roosevelt split the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> vote by running as a <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">third-party</a> candidate. In 1921, President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> appointed Taft to be chief justice, a position in which he served until a month before his death.

Taft was born in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> in 1857. His father, <a href="Alphonso%20Taft">Alphonso Taft</a>, was a <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>. Taft attended <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> and, like his father, was a member of <a href="Skull%20and%20Bones">Skull and Bones</a>. After becoming a lawyer, he was appointed a judge while still in his twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Solicitor General</a> and as a judge of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Sixth%20Circuit">Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>. In 1901, President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> appointed Taft <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">civilian governor of the Philippines</a>. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, believing his political work to be more important.

With Roosevelt's help, Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 and easily defeated <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> for the presidency that November. In the White House, he <a href="History%20of%20U.S.%20foreign%20policy%231893%E2%80%931914">focused</a> on East Asia more than European affairs and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, then a major source of governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies <a href="Pinchot%E2%80%93Ballinger%20controversy">over conservation</a> and <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">antitrust</a> cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of re-election and he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson's victory.

After leaving office, Taft returned to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the <a href="League%20to%20Enforce%20Peace">League to Enforce Peace</a>. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office he had long sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues and under him there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930. After his death the next month, he was buried at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in <a href="historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">historians' rankings of U.S. presidents</a>.

William Howard Taft was born September 15, 1857 in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, to <a href="Alphonso%20Taft">Alphonso Taft</a> and <a href="Louise%20Taft">Louise Torrey</a>. The <a href="Taft%20family">Taft family</a> was not wealthy, living in a modest home in the suburb of <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Historic%20District">Mount Auburn</a>. Alphonso served as a judge, ambassador and in the cabinet, as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">War Secretary</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> under <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.

William Taft was not seen as brilliant as a child, but was a hard worker; Taft's demanding parents pushed him and his four brothers toward success, tolerating nothing less. He attended <a href="Woodward%20High%20School%20%28Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio%29">Woodward High School</a> in Cincinnati. At <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a>, which he entered in 1874, the heavyset, jovial Taft was popular, and was an intramural heavyweight wrestling champion. One classmate described him succeeding through hard work rather than being the smartest, and as having integrity. In 1878, Taft graduated, second in his class out of 121. He attended <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati%20College%20of%20Law">Cincinnati Law School</a>, and graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> in 1880. While in law school, he worked on "The Cincinnati Commercial" newspaper, edited by <a href="Murat%20Halstead">Murat Halstead</a>. Taft was assigned to cover the local courts, and also spent time <a href="reading%20law">reading law</a> in his father's office; both activities gave him practical knowledge of the law that was not taught in class. Shortly before <a href="graduation">graduating</a> from law school, Taft went to the state capital of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus</a> to take the <a href="bar%20examination">bar examination</a> and easily passed.

After admission to the Ohio <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a>, Taft devoted himself to his job at the "Commercial" full-time. Halstead was willing to take him on permanently at an increased salary if he would give up the law, but Taft declined. In October 1880, Taft was appointed assistant prosecutor for <a href="Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio">Hamilton County</a> (where Cincinnati is located), and took office the following January. Taft served for a year as assistant prosecutor, trying his share of routine cases. He resigned in January 1882 after President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue for Ohio's First District, an area centered on Cincinnati. Taft refused to dismiss competent employees who were politically out of favor, and resigned effective in March 1883, writing to Arthur that he wished to begin private practice in Cincinnati. In 1884, Taft campaigned for the Republican candidate for president, Maine Senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, who lost to New York Governor <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>.

In 1887, Taft, then aged 29, was appointed to a vacancy on the Superior Court of Cincinnati by Governor <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a>. The appointment was good for just over a year, after which he would have to face the voters, and in April 1888, he sought election for the first of three times in his lifetime, the other two being for the presidency. He was elected to a full five-year term. Some two dozen of Taft's opinions as a state judge survive, the most significant being "Moores & Co. v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1" (1889) if only because it was used against him when he ran for president in 1908. The case involved bricklayers who refused to work for any firm that dealt with a company called Parker Brothers, with which they were in dispute. Taft ruled that the union's action amounted to a <a href="secondary%20boycott">secondary boycott</a>, which was illegal.

It is not clear when Taft met <a href="Helen%20Herron%20Taft">Helen Herron</a> (often called Nellie), but it was no later than 1880, when she mentioned in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of whom the eldest, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert</a>, became a U.S. senator.

There was a seat vacant on the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> in 1889, and Governor Foraker suggested President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and his professional goal was always a seat on the Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it. Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Solicitor General of the United States</a>. When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate the backlog, while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.

New York Senator <a href="William%20M.%20Evarts">William M. Evarts</a>, a former Secretary of State, had been a classmate of Alphonso Taft at Yale. Evarts called to see his friend's son as soon as Taft took office, and William and Nellie Taft were launched into Washington society. Nellie Taft was ambitious for herself and her husband, and was annoyed when the people he socialized with most were mainly Supreme Court justices, rather than the arbiters of Washington society such as <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> and their wives.

Although Taft was successful as Solicitor General, winning 15 of the 18 cases he argued before the Supreme Court, he was glad when in March 1891, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> created a new judgeship for each of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals">United States Courts of Appeal</a> and Harrison appointed him to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Sixth%20Circuit">Sixth Circuit</a>, based in Cincinnati. In March 1892, Taft resigned as Solicitor General to resume his judicial career.

Taft's <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">federal judgeship</a> was a lifetime appointment, and one from which promotion to the Supreme Court might come. Taft's older half-brother <a href="Charles%20P.%20Taft">Charles</a>, successful in business, supplemented Taft's government salary, allowing William and Nellie Taft and their family to live in comfort. Taft's duties involved hearing trials in the circuit, which included Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and participating with Supreme Court Justice <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a>, the <a href="circuit%20justice">circuit justice</a>, and judges of the Sixth Circuit in hearing appeals. Taft spent these years, from 1892 to 1900, in personal and professional contentment.

According to historian Louis L. Gould, "while Taft shared the fears about social unrest that dominated the middle classes during the 1890s, he was not as conservative as his critics believed. He supported the right of labor to organize and strike, and he ruled against employers in several negligence cases." Among these was "Voight v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway Co." Taft's decision for a worker injured in a railway accident violated the contemporary doctrine of <a href="liberty%20of%20contract">liberty of contract</a>, and he was reversed by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, Taft's opinion in "<a href="Addyston%20Pipe%20%26amp%3B%20Steel%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">United States v. Addyston Pipe and Steel Co.</a>" was upheld unanimously by the high court. Taft's opinion, in which he held that a pipe manufacturers' association had violated the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>, was described by <a href="Henry%20F.%20Pringle">Henry Pringle</a>, his biographer, as having "definitely and specifically revived" that legislation.

In 1896, Taft became dean and Professor of <a href="Property%20law">Property</a> at his "alma mater", the Cincinnati Law School, a post that required him to prepare and give two hour-long lectures each week. He was devoted to his law school, and was deeply committed to legal education, introducing the <a href="case%20method">case method</a> to the curriculum. As a federal judge, Taft could not involve himself with politics, but followed it closely, remaining a Republican supporter. He watched with some disbelief as <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">the campaign</a> of Ohio Governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> developed in 1894 and 1895, writing "I cannot find anybody in Washington who wants him". By March 1896, Taft realized that McKinley would likely be nominated, and was lukewarm in his support. He landed solidly in McKinley's camp after former Nebraska representative <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> in July stampeded the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> with his <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>. Bryan, both in that address and in <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">his campaign</a>, strongly advocated <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>, a policy that Taft saw as economic radicalism. Taft feared that people would hoard gold in anticipation of a Bryan victory, but he could do nothing but worry. McKinley <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">was elected</a>; when a place on the Supreme Court opened in 1898, the only one under McKinley, the president named <a href="Joseph%20McKenna">Joseph McKenna</a>.

In January 1900, Taft was called to Washington to meet with McKinley. Taft hoped a Supreme Court appointment was in the works, but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on <a href="Taft%20Commission">the commission</a> to organize a civilian government in <a href="the%20Philippines">the Philippines</a>. The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench; the president assured him that if he fulfilled this task, McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court. Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission, with responsibility for success or failure; McKinley agreed, and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900.

The American takeover meant the <a href="Philippine%20Revolution">Philippine Revolution</a> bled into the <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">Philippine–American War</a>, as Filipinos fought for their independence, but U.S. forces, led by military governor General <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%20Jr.">Arthur MacArthur Jr.</a> had the upper hand by 1900. MacArthur felt the commission was a nuisance, and their mission a quixotic attempt to impose self-government on a people unready for it. The general was forced to co-operate with Taft, as McKinley had given the commission control over the islands' military budget. The commission took executive power in the Philippines on September 1, 1900; on July 4, 1901, Taft became civilian <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">governor</a>. MacArthur, until then the military governor, was relieved by General <a href="Adna%20Chaffee">Adna Chaffee</a>, who was designated only as commander of American forces.

Taft sought to make the Filipinos partners in a venture that would lead to their self-government; he saw independence as something decades off. Many Americans in the Philippines viewed the locals as racial inferiors, but Taft wrote soon before his arrival, "we propose to banish this idea from their minds". Taft did not impose <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> at official events, and treated the Filipinos as social equals. Nellie Taft recalled that "neither politics nor race should influence our hospitality in any way".

McKinley was <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">assassinated</a> in September 1901, and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt. Taft and Roosevelt had first become friends around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt a member of the <a href="Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>. Taft had, after McKinley's election, urged the appointment of Roosevelt as <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</a>, and watched as Roosevelt became a war hero, <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">Governor of New York</a>, and <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President of the United States</a>. They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recuperate after two operations caused by an infection. There, Taft testified before the Senate Committee on the Philippines. Taft wanted Filipino farmers to have a stake in the new government through land ownership, but much of the arable land was held by Catholic <a href="religious%20order">religious order</a>s of mostly Spanish priests, which were often resented by the Filipinos. Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to negotiate with <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>, to purchase the lands and to arrange the withdrawal of the Spanish priests, with Americans replacing them and training locals as clergy. Taft did not succeed in resolving these issues on his visit to Rome, but an agreement on both points was made in 1903.

In late 1902, Taft had heard from Roosevelt that a seat on the Supreme Court would soon fall vacant on the resignation of Justice <a href="George%20Shiras%2C%20Jr.">George Shiras</a>, and Roosevelt desired that Taft fill it. Although this was Taft's professional goal, he refused as he felt his work as governor was not yet done. One reason for Roosevelt's action was his desire to neutralize a potential rival for the presidency: Taft's success in the Philippines had not gone unnoticed in the American press. The following year, Roosevelt asked Taft to become <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>. As the War Department administered the Philippines, Taft would remain responsible for the islands, and <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a>, the incumbent, was willing to postpone his departure until 1904, allowing Taft time to wrap up his work in Manila. After consulting with his family, Taft agreed, and sailed for the United States in December 1903.

Taft, a Unitarian, was a leader in the early 20th century of the favorable reappraisal of Catholicism's historic role. It tended to neutralize anti-Catholic sentiments, especially in the Far West where Protestantism was a weak force. In the Philippines, American government officials, journalists, and popular writers celebrated the Catholic missionary efforts that had transformed a "pagan" land, arguing that Filipino Catholic faith and clerical authority could aid in economic and cultural development. Taft, a top American official in Manila, was a spokesman for the reappraisals. He gave a speech at the Catholic <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> in Indiana in 1904, praising the, "enterprise, courage, and fidelity to duty that distinguished those heroes of Spain who braved the then frightful dangers of the deep to carry Christianity and European civilization into the far-off Orient." A second approach looked at Catholic missions in California, where local boosters celebrated the history of Spanish Franciscan missions. They not only restored and preserved old missions (which had been inactive since the 1830s) but began appealing to tourists with a romantic mission story. The mission style became popular for public buildings, schools and colleges. As President Taft in 1909 went to California to praise Father <a href="Jun%C3%ADpero%20Serra">Junípero Serra</a> as an "apostle, legislator, [and] builder" who advanced "the beginning of civilization in California."

When Taft took office as Secretary of War in January 1904, he was not called upon to spend much time administering the army, which the president was content to do himself—Roosevelt wanted Taft as a <a href="Troubleshooting">troubleshooter</a> in difficult situations, as a legal adviser, and to be able to give campaign speeches as he sought election in his own right. Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses, and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election, "I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office. It is awful to be afraid of one's shadow."

Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came to terms with the likelihood he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice <a href="Henry%20B.%20Brown">Henry B. Brown</a> resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. <a href="Edith%20Roosevelt">Edith Roosevelt</a>, the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a>, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.

Alternatively, Taft wanted to be chief justice, and kept a close eye on the health of the aging incumbent, <a href="Melville%20Fuller">Melville Fuller</a>, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft believed Fuller likely to live many years. Roosevelt had indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General <a href="Philander%20Knox">Philander Knox</a> a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.

Through the 1903 <a href="separation%20of%20Panama%20from%20Colombia">separation of Panama from Colombia</a> and the <a href="Hay-Bunau-Varilla%20Treaty">Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty</a>, the United States had secured rights to build <a href="Panama%20Canal">a canal</a> in the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. Legislation authorizing construction did not specify which government department would be responsible, and Roosevelt designated the Department of War. Taft journeyed to Panama in 1904, viewing the canal site and meeting with Panamanian officials. The <a href="Isthmian%20Canal%20Commission">Isthmian Canal Commission</a> had trouble keeping a chief engineer, and when in February 1907 <a href="John%20D.%20Stevens">John D. Stevens</a> submitted his resignation, Taft recommended an army engineer, <a href="George%20W.%20Goethals">George W. Goethals</a>. Under Goethals, the project moved ahead smoothly.

Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba, but as freedom for Cuba had been a major purpose of the war, it was not annexed by the U.S., but was, after a period of occupation, given independence in 1902. Election fraud and corruption followed, as did factional conflict. In September 1906, President <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Estrada%20Palma">Tomás Estrada Palma</a> asked for U.S. intervention. Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force, and on September 29, 1906, under the terms of the <a href="Cuban%E2%80%93American%20Treaty%20of%20Relations%20%281903%29">Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903</a>, declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba, a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Magoon">Charles Edward Magoon</a>. In his time in Cuba, Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability, not occupation.

Taft remained involved in Philippine affairs. During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904, he urged that Philippine agricultural products be admitted to the U.S. without duty. This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt, who remonstrated with his Secretary of War. Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position, and threatened to resign; Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter. Taft returned to the islands in 1905, leading a delegation of congressmen, and again in 1907, to open the first <a href="Philippine%20Assembly">Philippine Assembly</a>.

On both of his Philippine trips as Secretary of War, Taft went to Japan, and met with officials there. The meeting in July 1905 came a month before the conference which would end the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Portsmouth">Treaty of Portsmouth</a>. Taft met with Japanese Prime Minister <a href="Katsura%20Tar%C5%8D">Katsura Tarō</a>. After that meeting, the two signed <a href="Taft%E2%80%93Katsura%20Agreement">a memorandum</a>. It contained nothing new but instead reaffirmed official positions: Japan had no intention to invade the Philippines, and the U.S. that it did not object to <a href="Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule">Japanese control of Korea</a>. There were U.S. concerns about the number of Japanese laborers coming to the American West Coast, and during Taft's second visit, in September 1907, <a href="Tadasu%20Hayashi">Tadasu Hayashi</a>, the foreign minister, informally <a href="Gentlemen%27s%20Agreement%20of%201907">agreed to issue fewer passports to them</a>.

Roosevelt had served almost three and a half years of McKinley's term. On the night of his own election in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201908">in 1908</a>, a pledge he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of loss of their jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.

A number of Republican politicians, such as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="George%20Cortelyou">George Cortelyou</a>, tested the waters for a run but chose to stay out. New York Governor <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against <a href="corporate%20corruption">corporate corruption</a>. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages. Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.

Assistant <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Postmaster General</a> <a href="Frank%20H.%20Hitchcock">Frank H. Hitchcock</a> resigned from his office in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort. In April, Taft made a speaking tour, traveling as far west as <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a> before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out a contested election. At the <a href="1908%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1908 Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago in June, there was no serious opposition to him, and he gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not have things his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator <a href="Jonathan%20Dolliver">Jonathan Dolliver</a>, but instead the convention named Congressman <a href="James%20S.%20Sherman">James S. Sherman</a> of New York, a conservative. Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign.

Taft's opponent in the general election was Bryan, the Democratic nominee for the third time in four presidential elections. As many of Roosevelt's reforms stemmed from proposals by Bryan, the Democrat argued that he was the true heir to Roosevelt's mantle. Corporate contributions to federal political campaigns had been outlawed by the 1907 <a href="Tillman%20Act">Tillman Act</a>, and Bryan proposed that contributions by officers and directors of corporations be similarly banned, or at least disclosed when made. Taft was only willing to see the contributions disclosed after the election, and tried to ensure that officers and directors of corporations litigating with the government were not among his contributors.

Taft began the campaign on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of those who said he was not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at <a href="Sagamore%20Hill">Sagamore Hill</a> for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also obey the law. Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a>, subject to <a href="judicial%20review">judicial review</a>. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the <a href="Panic%20of%201907">Panic of 1907</a>, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on <a href="trust%20%28business%29">trusts</a> was needed to supplement the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>, and that <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">the constitution</a> should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.

Taft upset some progressives by choosing Hitchcock as Chairman of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC), placing him in charge of the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Virginia">Hot Springs, Virginia</a>, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.

Roosevelt, frustrated by his own relative inaction, showered Taft with advice, fearing that the electorate would not appreciate Taft's qualities, and that Bryan would win. Roosevelt's supporters spread rumors that the president was in effect running Taft's campaign. This annoyed Nellie Taft, who never trusted the Roosevelts. Nevertheless, Roosevelt supported the Republican nominee with such enthusiasm that humorists suggested "TAFT" stood for "Take advice from Theodore".

Bryan urged a system of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, offering a <a href="postal%20savings">postal savings</a> system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, <a href="Carrie%20Nation">Carrie Nation</a> called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.

In the end, Taft won by a comfortable margin. Taft defeated Bryan by 321 electoral votes to 162; however, he garnered just 51.6 percent of the popular vote. Nellie Taft said regarding the campaign, "There was nothing to criticize, except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played." Longtime White House usher <a href="Ike%20Hoover">Ike Hoover</a> recalled that Taft came often to see Roosevelt during the campaign, but seldom between the election and Inauguration Day, March 4, 1909.

Taft was <a href="Inauguration%20of%20William%20Howard%20Taft">sworn in as president</a> on March 4, 1909. Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice, Taft was inaugurated within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol as is customary. The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been "one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor" and to have had a part "in the reforms he has initiated. I should be untrue to myself, to my promises, and to the declarations of the party platform on which I was elected if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration". He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting, ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy. He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 <a href="Dingley%20Tariff">Dingley Tariff</a>, for antitrust reform, and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government. Roosevelt left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over and, to keep out of Taft's way, arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa.

Soon after the Republican convention, Taft and Roosevelt had discussed which cabinet officers would stay on. Taft kept only <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Agriculture">Agriculture Secretary</a> <a href="James%20Wilson%20%28Iowa%29">James Wilson</a> and Postmaster General <a href="George%20von%20Lengerke%20Meyer">George von Lengerke Meyer</a> (who was shifted to the Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included <a href="Philander%20Knox">Philander Knox</a>, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and <a href="Franklin%20MacVeagh">Franklin MacVeagh</a> as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a>.

Taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that Roosevelt had, choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had. His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion for the rule of law.

Taft made it a priority to restructure the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a>, noting, "it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900." The Department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions, including desks for the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> and <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>. The department's first in-service training program was established, and appointees spent a month in Washington before going to their posts. Taft and Secretary of State Knox had a strong relationship, and the president listened to his counsel on matters foreign and domestic. According to historian Paolo E. Coletta, Knox was not a good diplomat, and had poor relations with the Senate, press, and many foreign leaders, especially those from Latin America.

There was broad agreement between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force if necessary to enforce the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided <a href="United%20States%20foreign%20policy">United States foreign policy</a> in the Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield to arbitrators its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties.

At the time of Taft's presidency, <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> through the use of tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition. The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.

<a href="Sereno%20E.%20Payne">Sereno E. Payne</a>, chairman of the <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">House Ways and Means Committee</a>, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>, Rhode Island Senator <a href="Nelson%20W.%20Aldrich">Nelson W. Aldrich</a>, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's <a href="Robert%20M.%20La%20Follette%20Sr.">Robert M. La Follette</a>, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.

When opponents sought to modify the tariff bill to allow for an income tax, Taft opposed it on the ground that the Supreme Court would likely strike it down as unconstitutional, as it had before. Instead, they proposed a constitutional amendment, which passed both houses in early July, was sent to the states, and by 1913 was ratified as the <a href="Sixteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixteenth Amendment</a>. In the <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a>, Taft won some victories, such as limiting the tax on lumber. The conference report passed both houses, and Taft signed it on August 6, 1909. The <a href="Payne-Aldrich%20tariff">Payne-Aldrich tariff</a> was immediately controversial. According to Coletta, "Taft had lost the initiative, and the wounds inflicted in the acrid tariff debate never healed".

In Taft's <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message</a> sent to Congress in December 1910, he urged a <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> accord with Canada. Britain at that time still handled Canada's foreign relations, and Taft found the British and Canadian governments willing. Many in Canada opposed an accord, fearing the U.S. would dump it when convenient as it had the 1854 <a href="Elgin-Marcy%20Treaty">Elgin-Marcy Treaty</a> in 1866, and farm and fisheries interests in the United States were also opposed. After January 1911 talks with Canadian officials, Taft had the agreement, which was not a treaty, introduced into Congress and it passed in late July. The <a href="Canadian%20Parliament">Canadian Parliament</a>, led by Prime Minister Sir <a href="Wilfrid%20Laurier">Wilfrid Laurier</a>, had deadlocked over the issue. Canadians turned Laurier out of office in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201911">September 1911 election</a> and <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a> became the new prime minister. No cross-border agreement was concluded, and the debate deepened divisions in the Republican Party.

Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, instituted a policy of <a href="Dollar%20Diplomacy">Dollar Diplomacy</a> towards Latin America, believing U.S. investment would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that did not wish to become financial protectorates of the United States, as well as in the U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>.

When Taft entered office, Mexico was increasingly restless under the grip of longtime dictator <a href="Porfirio%20D%C3%ADaz">Porfirio Díaz</a>. Many Mexicans backed his opponent, <a href="Francisco%20Madero">Francisco Madero</a>. There were a number of incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> to the border areas for maneuvers. Taft told his military aide, <a href="Archibald%20Butt">Archibald Butt</a>, that "I am going to sit on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off". He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, and <a href="Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20Mexico">Ciudad Juárez, Mexico</a>, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The day of the summit, <a href="Frederick%20Russell%20Burnham">Frederick Russell Burnham</a> and a <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Ranger</a> captured and disarmed an assassin holding a <a href="Protector%20Palm%20Pistol">palm pistol</a> only a few feet from the two presidents. Before the election in Mexico, Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero, whose supporters took up arms. This resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the U.S.'s <a href="Arizona%20Territory">Arizona Territory</a>, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft was against an aggressive response and so instructed the territorial governor.

Nicaragua's president, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Santos%20Zelaya">José Santos Zelaya</a>, wanted to revoke commercial concessions granted to American companies, and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under <a href="Juan%20Estrada">Juan Estrada</a>. Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route fall into the hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Madriz">José Madriz</a>, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took <a href="Managua">Managua</a>, the capital. The U.S. compelled Nicaragua to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Nicaragua">United States occupation of Nicaragua</a>, which lasted until 1933.

Treaties among Panama, Colombia, and the United States to resolve disputes arising from the Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame-duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909, and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama. Colombia, however, declined to ratify the treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount inadequate, and requested arbitration; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration.

Due to his years in the Philippines, Taft was keenly interested as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, but because of the potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to <a href="Beijing">Peking</a> to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, <a href="William%20W.%20Rockhill">William W. Rockhill</a>, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with <a href="William%20J.%20Calhoun">William J. Calhoun</a>, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's <a href="Open%20Door%20Policy">Open Door Policy</a> to <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>.

In 1898, an American company had gained a concession for a railroad between <a href="Hankow">Hankow</a> and <a href="Szechuan">Szechuan</a>, but the Chinese revoked the agreement in 1904 after the company (which was indemnified for the revocation) breached the agreement by selling a majority stake outside the United States. The Chinese imperial government got the money for the indemnity from the British <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> government, on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line, and in 1909, a British-led consortium began negotiations. This came to Knox's attention in May of that year, and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate. Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent, <a href="Zaifeng%2C%20Prince%20Chun">Zaifeng, Prince Chun</a>, and was successful in gaining U.S. participation, though agreements were not signed until May 1911. However, the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces. Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders, and these grievances were among those which touched off the <a href="Chinese%20Revolution%20of%201911">Chinese Revolution of 1911</a>.

After the revolution broke out, the revolt's leaders chose <a href="Sun%20Yat%20Sen">Sun Yat Sen</a> as provisional president of what became the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a>, overthrowing the <a href="Manchu%20Dynasty">Manchu Dynasty</a>, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion was in favor of it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message to Congress</a> in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.

Taft continued the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt. A revised treaty of friendship and navigation entered into by the U.S. and Japan in 1911 granted broad reciprocal rights to Japanese people in America and Americans in Japan, but were premised on the continuation of the Gentlemen's Agreement. There was objection on the West Coast when the treaty was submitted to the Senate, but Taft informed politicians that there was no change in immigration policy.

Taft was opposed to the traditional practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they saw one. High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, <a href="Henry%20White%20%28diplomat%29">Henry White</a>, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, <a href="Whitelaw%20Reid">Whitelaw Reid</a>, but Reid, owner of the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.

Taft was a supporter of settling international disputes by arbitration, and he negotiated treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated. These were signed in August 1911. Neither Taft nor Knox (a former senator) consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.

Although no general arbitration treaty was entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included a settlement of the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a> that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.

Taft continued and expanded Roosevelt's efforts to break up business combinations through lawsuits brought under the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>, bringing 70 cases in four years (Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years). Suits brought against the <a href="Standard%20Oil%20Company">Standard Oil Company</a> and the <a href="American%20Tobacco%20Company">American Tobacco Company</a>, initiated under Roosevelt, were decided in favor of the government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into <a href="United%20States%20Steel">United States Steel</a> (U.S. Steel). That company had been expanded under Roosevelt, who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the <a href="Panic%20of%201907">Panic of 1907</a>, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a bargain. For Roosevelt, questioning the matter went to his personal honesty.

In October 1911, Taft's Justice Department brought suit against U.S. Steel, demanding that over a hundred of its subsidiaries be granted corporate independence, and naming as defendants many prominent business executives and financiers. The pleadings in the case had not been reviewed by Taft, and alleged that Roosevelt "had fostered monopoly, and had been duped by clever industrialists". Roosevelt was offended by the references to him and his administration in the pleadings, and felt that Taft could not evade command responsibility by saying he did not know of them.

Taft sent a special message to Congress on the need for a revamped antitrust statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the <a href="International%20Harvester%20Company">International Harvester Company</a>, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.

Roosevelt was an ardent conservationist, assisted in this by like-minded appointees, including Interior Secretary <a href="James%20R.%20Garfield">James R. Garfield</a> and Chief Forester <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a>. Taft agreed with the need for conservation, but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor <a href="Richard%20A.%20Ballinger">Richard A. Ballinger</a>. Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield, and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies.

Roosevelt had withdrawn much land from the public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Clarence Cunningham, an Idaho entrepreneur, had found coal deposits in Alaska, and made mining claims, and the government investigated their legality. This dragged on for the remainder of the Roosevelt administration, including during the year (1907–1908) when Ballinger served as head of the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a>. A special agent for the Land Office, <a href="Louis%20Glavis">Louis Glavis</a>, investigated the Cunningham claims, and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them, Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot.

In September 1909, Glavis made his allegations public in a magazine article, disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service. This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for. On September 13, 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service, relying on a report from Attorney General <a href="George%20W.%20Wickersham">George W. Wickersham</a> dated two days previously. Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal, which Taft tried to avoid, fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt (still overseas). Taft asked <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a> (by then a senator) to look into the matter, and Root urged the firing of Pinchot.

Taft had ordered government officials not to comment on the fracas. In January 1910, Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service, Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands. According to Pringle, this "was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office". Pinchot was dismissed, much to his delight, and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt. A congressional investigation followed, which cleared Ballinger by majority vote, but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney, <a href="Louis%20D.%20Brandeis">Louis D. Brandeis</a>, proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated, which Taft belatedly admitted. The Ballinger–Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda.

Taft announced in his inaugural address that he would not appoint African Americans to federal jobs, such as postmaster, where this would cause racial friction. This differed from Roosevelt, who would not remove or replace black officeholders with whom local whites would not deal. Termed Taft's "Southern Policy", this stance effectively invited white protests against black appointees. Taft followed through, removing most black office holders in the South, and made few appointments from that race in the North.

At the time Taft was inaugurated, the way forward for African Americans was debated by their leaders. <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> felt that most blacks should be trained for industrial work, with only a few seeking higher education; <a href="W.E.B.%20DuBois">W.E.B. DuBois</a> took a more militant stand for equality. Taft tended towards Washington's approach. According to Coletta, Taft let the African-American "be 'kept in his place'  ... He thus failed to see or follow the humanitarian mission historically associated with the Republican party, with the result that Negroes both North and South began to drift toward the Democratic party."

A supporter of free immigration, Taft vetoed a bill passed by Congress and supported by labor unions that would have restricted unskilled laborers by imposing a literacy test.

Taft made six appointments to the Supreme Court, the most of any president except <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. The death of Justice <a href="Rufus%20Peckham">Rufus Peckham</a> in October 1909 gave Taft his first opportunity. He chose an old friend and colleague from the Sixth Circuit, <a href="Horace%20H.%20Lurton">Horace H. Lurton</a> of Georgia; he had in vain urged Theodore Roosevelt to appoint Lurton to the high court. Attorney General Wickersham objected that Lurton, a former Confederate soldier and a Democrat, was aged 65. Taft named Lurton anyway on December 13, 1909, and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote a week later. Lurton is still the oldest person to be made an associate justice. Lurie suggested that Taft, already beset by the tariff and conservation controversies, desired to perform an official act which gave him pleasure, especially since he thought Lurton deserved it.

Justice <a href="David%20Josiah%20Brewer">David Josiah Brewer</a>'s death on March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second opportunity to fill a seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, and when he did, it was with Justice <a href="Edward%20Douglass%20White">Edward Douglass White</a>, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed <a href="Willis%20Van%20Devanter">Willis Van Devanter</a> of Wyoming, a federal appeals judge. By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to <a href="William%20Henry%20Moody">William Henry Moody</a>'s retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Lamar">Joseph R. Lamar</a>, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.

With the death of Justice Harlan in October 1911, Taft got to fill a sixth seat on the Supreme Court. After Secretary Knox declined appointment, Taft named <a href="New%20Jersey%20Supreme%20Court">Chancellor of New Jersey</a> <a href="Mahlon%20Pitney">Mahlon Pitney</a>, the last person appointed to the Supreme Court who did not attend law school. Pitney had a stronger anti-labor record than Taft's other appointments, and was the only one to meet opposition, winning confirmation by a Senate vote of 50—26.

Taft appointed 13 judges to the federal courts of appeal and 38 to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20courts">United States district courts</a>. Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts, including the first five appointees each to the <a href="United%20States%20Commerce%20Court">United States Commerce Court</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Customs%20and%20Patent%20Appeals">United States Court of Customs Appeals</a>. The Commerce Court, created in 1910, stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission. There was considerable opposition to its establishment, which only grew when one of its judges, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Archbald">Robert W. Archbald</a>, was in 1912 <a href="impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States">impeached</a> for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January. Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court, but the respite was short-lived as <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Wilson</a> signed similar legislation in October 1913.

During Roosevelt's fifteen months beyond the Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote much to the other. Taft biographer Lurie suggested that each expected the other to make the first move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.

Taft and Roosevelt met twice in 1910; the meetings, though outwardly cordial, did not display their former closeness. Roosevelt gave a series of speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910. Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in "<a href="Lochner%20v.%20New%20York">Lochner v. New York</a>", he accused the federal courts of undermining democracy, and called for them to be deprived of <a href="Judicial%20review%20in%20the%20United%20States">the power to rule legislation unconstitutional</a>. This attack horrified Taft, who privately agreed that "Lochner" had been wrongly decided. Roosevelt called for "elimination of corporate expenditures for political purposes, physical valuation of railroad properties, regulation of industrial combinations, establishment of an export tariff commission, a graduated income tax" as well as "workmen's compensation laws, state and national legislation to regulate the [labor] of women and children, and complete publicity of campaign expenditure". According to John Murphy in his journal article on the breach between the two presidents, "As Roosevelt began to move to the left, Taft veered to the right."

During the 1910 midterm election campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried to secure the election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.

After the election, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive ideals, a <a href="New%20Nationalism%20%28Theodore%20Roosevelt%29">New Nationalism</a>, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were not that of the party of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, but those of the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a>. The feud continued on and off through 1911, a year in which there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.

Roosevelt was receiving many letters from supporters urging him to run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, it would be a repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.

As Roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism, Taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, as he was convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of <a href="Archibald%20Butt">Archibald Butt</a>, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the <a href="RMS%20Titanic">RMS "Titanic"</a> and died in <a href="Sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Titanic">its sinking</a>, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.

Roosevelt dominated the primaries, winning 278 of the 362 delegates to <a href="1912%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago decided in that manner. Taft had control of the party machinery, and it came as no surprise that he gained the bulk of the delegates decided at district or state conventions. Taft did not have a majority, but was likely to have one once southern delegations committed to him. Roosevelt challenged the election of these delegates, but the RNC overruled most objections. Roosevelt's sole remaining chance was with a friendly convention chairman, who might make rulings on the seating of delegates that favored his side. Taft followed custom and remained in Washington, but Roosevelt went to Chicago to run his campaign and told his supporters in a speech, "we stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord".

Taft had won over Root, who agreed to run for temporary chairman of the convention, and the delegates elected Root over Roosevelt's candidate. The Roosevelt forces moved to substitute the delegates they supported for the ones they argued should not be seated. Root made a crucial ruling, that although the contested delegates could not vote on their own seating, they could vote on the other contested delegates, a ruling that assured Taft's nomination, as the motion offered by the Roosevelt forces failed, 567—507. As it became clear Roosevelt would bolt the party if not nominated, some Republicans sought a compromise candidate to avert the electoral disaster to come; they were unsuccessful. Taft's name was placed in nomination by Warren Harding, whose attempts to praise Taft and unify the party were met with angry interruptions from progressives. Taft was nominated on the first ballot, though most Roosevelt delegates refused to vote.

Alleging Taft had stolen the nomination, Roosevelt and his followers formed the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>. Taft knew he would almost certainly be defeated, but concluded that through Roosevelt's loss at Chicago the party had been preserved as "the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions." He made his doomed run to preserve the Republican Party. Governor Woodrow Wilson was the Democratic nominee. Seeing Roosevelt as the greater electoral threat, Wilson spent little time attacking Taft, arguing that Roosevelt had been lukewarm in opposing the trusts during his presidency, and that Wilson was the true reformer. Taft contrasted what he called his "progressive conservatism" with Roosevelt's Progressive democracy, which to Taft represented "the establishment of a benevolent despotism."

Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking re-election did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, making his nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded he could not win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers out on the campaign trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.

Vice President Sherman had been renominated at Chicago; seriously ill during the campaign, he died six days before the election, and was replaced on the ticket by the president of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Murray%20Butler">Nicholas Murray Butler</a>. But few electors chose Taft and Butler, who won only Utah and Vermont, for a total of eight electoral votes. Roosevelt won 88, and Wilson 435. Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined. Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote, but finished with just under 3.5 million, over 600,000 less than the former president. Taft was not on the ballot in California, due to the actions of local Progressives, nor in South Dakota.

With no pension or other compensation to expect from the government after leaving the White House, Taft contemplated a return to the practice of law, from which he had long been absent. Given that Taft had appointed many federal judges, including a majority of the Supreme Court, this would raise questions of conflict of interest at every federal court appearance and he was saved from this by an offer for him to become Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at <a href="Yale%20Law%20School">Yale Law School</a>. He accepted, and after a month's vacation in Georgia, arrived in New Haven on April 1, 1913 to a rapturous reception. As it was too late in the semester for him to give an academic course, he instead prepared eight lectures on "Questions of Modern Government", which he delivered in May. He earned money with paid speeches and with articles for magazines, and would end his eight years out of office having increased his savings. While at Yale, he wrote the treatise, "Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers" (1916).

Taft had been made president of the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a> Commission while still in office; when Democrats proposed removing him for one of their party, he quipped that unlike losing the presidency, such a removal would hurt. The architect, <a href="Henry%20Bacon">Henry Bacon</a>, wanted to use Colorado-Yule marble, while southern Democrats urged using Georgia marble. Taft lobbied for the western stone, and the matter was submitted to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, which supported Taft and Bacon. The project went forward; Taft would dedicate the Lincoln Memorial as chief justice in 1922. In 1913, Taft was elected to a one-year term as president of the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> (ABA), a trade group of lawyers. He removed opponents, such as Louis Brandeis and <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20Law%20School">University of Pennsylvania Law School</a> dean <a href="William%20Draper%20Lewis">William Draper Lewis</a> (a supporter of the Progressive Party) from committees.

Taft maintained a cordial relationship with Wilson. The former president privately criticized his successor on a number of issues, but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy. Taft was appalled when, after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916, Wilson nominated Brandeis, whom the former president had never forgiven for his role in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis, Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents, stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis. Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency, at a funeral at Yale. They spoke only for a moment, politely but formally.

As president of the <a href="League%20to%20Enforce%20Peace">League to Enforce Peace</a>, Taft hoped to prevent war through an international association of nations. With <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> raging in Europe, Taft sent Wilson a note of support for his foreign policy in 1915. President Wilson accepted Taft's invitation to address the league, and spoke in May 1916 of a postwar international organization that could prevent a repetition. Taft supported the effort to get Justice Hughes to resign from the bench and accept the Republican presidential nomination. Once this was done, Hughes tried to get Roosevelt and Taft to reconcile, as a united effort was needed to defeat Wilson. This occurred on October 3 in New York, but Roosevelt allowed only a handshake, and no words were exchanged. This was one of many difficulties for the Republicans in the campaign, and Wilson narrowly won re-election.

In March 1917, Taft demonstrated public support for the war effort by joining the Connecticut State Guard, a <a href="state%20defense%20force">state defense force</a> organized to carry out the state duties of the <a href="Connecticut%20Army%20National%20Guard">Connecticut National Guard</a> while the National Guard served on active duty. When Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917, Taft was an enthusiastic supporter; he was chairman of the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a>' executive committee, which occupied much of the former president's time. In August 1917, Wilson conferred military titles on executives of the Red Cross as a way to provide them with additional authority to use in carrying out their wartime responsibilities, and Taft was appointed a <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a>.

During the war, Taft took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the <a href="National%20War%20Labor%20Board%20%281918%E2%80%931919%29">National War Labor Board</a>, tasked with assuring good relations between industry owners and their workers. In February 1918, the new RNC chairman, <a href="Will%20H.%20Hays">Will H. Hays</a>, approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt. In May, Taft was in Chicago at the <a href="Blackstone%20Hotel">Blackstone Hotel</a>, and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there, walked in on them. The two men embraced to the applause of the room, but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919. Taft later wrote, "Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me, I would have mourned the fact all my life. I loved him always and cherish his memory."

When Wilson proposed establishment of a <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, with the League's charter part of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, Taft expressed public support. He was out of step with his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent <a href="Flip-flop%20%28politics%29">flip-flop</a> on the issue of whether <a href="reservation%20%28law%29">reservations</a> to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.

During the 1920 election campaign, Taft supported the Republican ticket, Harding (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>; they were elected. Taft was among those asked to come to the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">president-elect's</a> <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding%20House">home</a> in <a href="Marion%2C%20Ohio">Marion, Ohio</a> to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920. By Taft's later account, after some conversation, Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court; if Taft would, Harding would appoint him. Taft had a condition for Harding—having served as president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could accept only the chief justice position. Harding made no response, and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House. In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him, if given the chance.

White by then was in failing health, but made no move to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4, 1921. Taft called on the chief justice on March 26, and found White ill, but still carrying on his work and not talking of retiring. White did not retire, dying in office on May 19, 1921. Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat, and waited and worried if he would be White's successor. Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement. Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with <a href="Ohio%20Gang">the Ohio politicians</a> who formed Harding's inner circle.

It later emerged that Harding had also promised former Utah senator <a href="George%20Sutherland">George Sutherland</a> a seat on the Supreme Court, and was waiting in the expectation that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice <a href="William%20R.%20Day">William R. Day</a> to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General <a href="Harry%20Daugherty">Harry Daugherty</a>, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in <a href="executive%20session">executive session</a>. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.

The Supreme Court, under Taft, compiled a conservative record in <a href="Commerce%20Clause">Commerce Clause</a> jurisprudence. This had the practical effect of making it difficult for the federal government to regulate industry, and the <a href="Taft%20Court">Taft Court</a> also scuttled many state laws. The few liberals on the court—Brandeis, <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Holmes</a>, and (from 1925) <a href="Harlan%20Fiske%20Stone">Harlan Fiske Stone</a>—sometimes protested, believing orderly progress essential, but often joined in the majority opinion.

The White Court had, in 1918, struck down an attempt by Congress to regulate child labor in "<a href="Hammer%20v.%20Dagenhart">Hammer v. Dagenhart</a>". Congress thereafter attempted to end child labor by imposing a tax on certain corporations making use of it. That law was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1922 in "<a href="Bailey%20v.%20Drexel%20Furniture%20Co.">Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.</a>", with Taft writing the court's opinion for an 8–1 majority. He held that the tax was not intended to raise revenue, but rather was an attempt to regulate matters reserved to the states under the <a href="Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a>, and that allowing such taxation would eliminate the power of the states. One case in which Taft and his court upheld federal regulation was "<a href="Stafford%20v.%20Wallace">Stafford v. Wallace</a>". Taft ruled for a 7–1 majority that the processing of animals in <a href="Feedlot">stockyards</a> was so closely tied to interstate commerce as to bring it within the ambit of Congress's power to regulate.

A case in which the Taft Court struck down regulation that generated a dissent from the chief justice was "<a href="Adkins%20v.%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Adkins v. Children's Hospital</a>". Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a>, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in "Adkins" was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because it was one of the few times he took an expansive view of the <a href="Police%20power%20%28United%20States%20constitutional%20law%29">police power</a> of the government.

In 1922, Taft ruled for a unanimous court in "<a href="Balzac%20v.%20Porto%20Rico">Balzac v. Porto Rico</a>". One of the <a href="Insular%20Cases">Insular Cases</a>, "Balzac" involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a jury trial, a <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixth Amendment</a> protection under the constitution. Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood, only such constitutional protections as Congress decreed would apply to its residents.
In 1926, Taft wrote for a 6–3 majority in "<a href="Myers%20v.%20United%20States">Myers v. United States</a>" that Congress could not require the president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted that there is no restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although "Myers" involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">had been impeached</a>, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued "Myers" as his most important opinion.

The following year, the court decided "<a href="McGrain%20v.%20Daugherty">McGrain v. Daugherty</a>". A congressional committee investigating possible complicity of former Attorney General Daugherty in the <a href="Teapot%20Dome">Teapot Dome</a> scandal subpoenaed records from his brother, Mally, who refused to provide them, alleging Congress had no power to obtain documents from him. Van Devanter ruled for a unanimous court against him, finding that Congress had the authority to conduct investigations as an auxiliary to its legislative function.

In 1925, the Taft Court laid the groundwork for the <a href="Incorporation%20of%20the%20Bill%20of%20Rights">incorporation</a> of many of the guarantees of the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> to be applied against the states through the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. In "<a href="Gitlow%20v.%20New%20York">Gitlow v. New York</a>", the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice <a href="Edward%20T.%20Sanford">Edward T. Sanford</a> wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment's</a> <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%23Freedom%20of%20speech">Free Speech</a> and <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%23Free%20Press%20Clause">Free Press</a> clauses were protected against infringement by the states.

"<a href="Pierce%20v.%20Society%20of%20Sisters">Pierce v. Society of Sisters</a>" was a 1925 decision by the Taft Court striking down an Oregon law banning private schools. In a decision written by Justice <a href="James%20C.%20McReynolds">James C. McReynolds</a>, a unanimous court held that Oregon could regulate private schools, but could not eliminate them. The outcome supported the right of parents to control the education of their children, but also, since the <a href="lead%20plaintiff">lead plaintiff</a> (the society) ran <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic school</a>s, struck a blow for religious freedom.

"<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Lanza">United States v. Lanza</a>" was one of a series of cases involving <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>. Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in <a href="federal%20district%20court">federal district court</a>. He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the <a href="Double%20Jeopardy%20Clause">Double Jeopardy Clause</a> of the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>. Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that the state and federal governments were <a href="dual%20sovereignty%20doctrine">dual sovereigns</a>, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.

Taft exercised the power of his position to influence the decisions of his colleagues, urging unanimity and discouraging dissents. Alpheus Mason, in his article on Chief Justice Taft for the "<a href="American%20Bar%20Association%20Journal">American Bar Association Journal</a>", contrasted Taft's expansive view of the role of the chief justice with the narrow view of presidential power he took while in that office. Taft saw nothing wrong with making his views on possible appointments to the court known to the White House, and was annoyed to be criticized in the press. He was initially a firm supporter of President Coolidge after Harding's death in 1923, but became disillusioned with Coolidge's appointments to office and to the bench; he had similar misgivings about Coolidge's successor, <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>. Taft advised the Republican presidents in office while he was chief justice to avoid "offside" appointments like Brandeis and Holmes. Nevertheless, by 1923, Taft was writing of his liking for Brandeis, whom he deemed a hard worker, and Holmes walked to work with him until age and infirmity required an automobile.

Believing that the chief justice should be responsible for the federal courts, Taft felt that he should have an administrative staff to assist him, and the chief justice should be empowered to temporarily reassign judges. He also believed the federal courts had been ill-run. Many of the lower courts had lengthy backlogs, as did the Supreme Court. Immediately on taking office, Taft made it a priority to confer with Attorney General Daugherty as to new legislation, and made his case before congressional hearings, in legal periodicals and in speeches across the country. When Congress convened in December 1921, a bill was introduced for 24 new judges, to empower the chief justice to move judges temporarily to eliminate the delays, and to have him chair a body consisting of the senior appellate judge of each circuit. Congress objected to some aspects, requiring Taft to get the agreement of the senior judge of each involved circuit before assigning a judge, but it in September 1922 passed the bill, and the <a href="Judicial%20Conference%20of%20the%20United%20States">Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges</a> held its first meeting that December.

The Supreme Court's docket was congested, swelled by war litigation and laws that allowed a party defeated in the circuit court of appeals to have the case decided by the Supreme Court if a constitutional question was involved. Taft believed an appeal should usually be settled by the circuit court, with only cases of major import decided by the justices. He and other Supreme Court members proposed legislation to make most of the court's docket discretionary, with a case getting full consideration by the justices only if they granted a writ of <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a>. To Taft's frustration, Congress took three years to consider the matter. Taft and other members of the court lobbied for the bill in Congress, and the <a href="Judiciary%20Act%20of%201925">Judges' Bill</a> became law in February 1925. By late the following year, Taft was able to show that the backlog was shrinking.

When Taft became chief justice, the court did not have its own building and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a fight to get the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, on the south side of the Capitol. <a href="Cass%20Gilbert">Cass Gilbert</a> had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court%20Building">the new building</a>, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.

Taft is remembered as the heaviest president; he was tall and his weight peaked at toward the end of his presidency, although this later decreased, and by 1929 he weighed just . By the time Taft became chief justice, his health was starting to decline, and he carefully planned a fitness regimen, walking from his home to the Capitol each day. When he walked home after work, he would usually go by way of <a href="Connecticut%20Avenue">Connecticut Avenue</a> and use a particular crossing over <a href="Rock%20Creek%20%28Potomac%20River%29">Rock Creek</a>. After his death, the crossing was named the <a href="Taft%20Bridge">Taft Bridge</a>.

Taft followed a weight loss program and hired the British doctor <a href="Nathaniel%20Edward%20Yorke-Davies">N. E. Yorke-Davies</a> as a dietary advisor. The two men corresponded regularly for over twenty years, and Taft kept a daily record of his weight, food intake, and physical activity.
At <a href="Inauguration%20of%20Herbert%20Hoover">Hoover's inauguration</a> on March 4, 1929, Taft recited part of the oath incorrectly, later writing, "my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain", misquoting again in that letter, differently. His health gradually declined over the near-decade of his chief justiceship. Worried that if he retired his replacement would be chosen by President Herbert Hoover, who he considered too progressive, he wrote his brother Horace in 1929, "I am older and slower and less acute and more confused. However, as long as things continue as they are, and I am able to answer to my place, I must stay on the court in order to prevent the Bolsheviki from getting control".

Taft insisted on going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health. When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not returned to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but had been unable to complete because of his illness. Taft went to <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, for a rest, but by the end of January, he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations. Taft was afraid that <a href="Harlan%20Fiske%20Stone">Stone</a> would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Hughes</a> would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.

Taft <a href="lying%20in%20state%23United%20States">lay in state</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">United States Capitol rotunda</a>. Three days following his death, on March 11, he became the first president and first member of the Supreme Court to be buried at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>. <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> sculpted his grave marker out of <a href="Stony%20Creek%20%28Branford%29">Stony Creek</a> granite.

Lurie argued that Taft did not receive the public credit for his policies that he should have. Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt (although the lawsuits received much publicity). Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such a thing as a "good" trust. This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft "was boring—honest, likable, but boring". Scott Bomboy for the <a href="National%20Constitution%20Center">National Constitution Center</a> wrote that despite being "one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents  ... a chief justice of the United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan  ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub," a story that is not true. Taft similarly remains known for another physical characteristic—as the last <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20with%20facial%20hair">president with facial hair</a> to date.

Mason called Taft's years in the White House "undistinguished". Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress, but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill. Anderson noted that Taft's prepresidential federal service was entirely in appointed posts, and that he had never run for an important executive or legislative position, which would have allowed him to develop the skills to manipulate public opinion, "the presidency is no place for on-the-job training". According to Coletta, "in troubled times in which the people demanded progressive change, he saw the existing order as good."

Inevitably linked with Roosevelt, Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant <a href="Rough%20Rider">Rough Rider</a>, who chose him to be president, and who took it away. Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?" Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation. Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent. And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a <a href="James%20Buchanan">Buchanan</a>-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's "Autobiography" (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor. While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.
Taft was convinced he would be vindicated by history. After he left office, he was estimated to be about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".

Taft has been rated among the greatest of the chief justices; later Supreme Court Justice <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a> noted that this was "not so much on the basis of his opinions, perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history". A successor as chief justice, <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a>, concurred: "In Taft's case, the symbol, the tag, the label usually attached to him is 'conservative.' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics, but its use is too often confused with 'reactionary.' " Most commentators agree that as chief justice, Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court, urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities. Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court. According to Anderson, Taft as chief justice "was as aggressive in the pursuit of his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential".

The house in Cincinnati where Taft was born and lived as a boy is now the <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft%20National%20Historic%20Site">William Howard Taft National Historic Site</a>. Taft's son <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert</a> was a significant political figure, becoming <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a> and three times a major contender for the Republican nomination for president. A conservative, each time he was defeated by a candidate backed by the more liberal <a href="Eastern%20Establishment">Eastern Establishment</a> wing of the party.

Watchmen

Watchmen is a science fiction <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a> <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a> by the British creative team of writer <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a>, artist <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> and colorist <a href="John%20Higgins%20%28comics%29">John Higgins</a>. It was published by <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> in 1986 and 1987, and collected in a single volume edition in 1987. "Watchmen" originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring <a href="superhero">superhero</a> characters that the company had acquired from <a href="Charlton%20Comics">Charlton Comics</a>. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor <a href="Dick%20Giordano">Dick Giordano</a> convinced Moore to create original characters instead.

Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. "Watchmen" depicts an <a href="alternate%20history">alternate history</a> where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and the <a href="Watergate%20break-in">Watergate break-in</a> was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward <a href="World%20War%20III">World War III</a> with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and <a href="Moral%20ambiguity">moral struggles</a> of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.

Creatively, the focus of "Watchmen" is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained <a href="smiley">smiley face</a>. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled "Tales of the Black Freighter", which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a <a href="nonlinear%20narrative">nonlinear narrative</a>, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, <a href="coincidence">coincidence</a> and repeated imagery.

A commercial success, "Watchmen" has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. "Watchmen" was recognized in "Time"s <a href="Time%27s%20List%20of%20the%20100%20Best%20Novels">List of the 100 Best Novels</a> as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Nicholas Barber described it as "the moment comic books grew up".

After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a>'s "<a href="Watchmen%20%28film%29">Watchmen</a>" was released in 2009. A video game series, "", was released in the same year to coincide with the film's release.

DC Comics published "<a href="Before%20Watchmen">Before Watchmen</a>", a series of nine <a href="prequel">prequel</a> miniseries in 2012, and "<a href="Doomsday%20Clock%20%28comics%29">Doomsday Clock</a>", a 12-issue limited series, a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to the original series that premiered in 2017, both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement.

"Watchmen", created by writer <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and artist <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a>, first appeared in the 1985 issue of DC Spotlight, the 50th anniversary special. It was eventually published as a 12-issue <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">maxiseries</a> from <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>, <a href="cover-date">cover-date</a>d September 1986 to October 1987. It was subsequently collected in 1987 as a DC Comics <a href="Trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a> that has had at least 24 printings as of March 2017; another trade paperback was published by <a href="Warner%20Books">Warner Books</a>, a DC sister company, in 1987.

In February 1988, DC published a limited-edition, slipcased hardcover volume, produced by Graphitti Design, that contained 48 pages of bonus material, including the original proposal and concept art. In 2005, DC released "Absolute Watchmen", an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC's <a href="DC%20Comics%20Absolute%20Edition">Absolute Edition</a> format. Assembled under the supervision of Dave Gibbons, "Absolute Watchmen" included the Graphitti materials, as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins. That December DC published a new printing of "Watchmen" issue #1 at the original 1986 cover price of $1.50 as part of its "Millennium Edition" line.

In 2012, DC published "<a href="Before%20Watchmen">Before Watchmen</a>" a series of nine prequel miniseries, with various creative teams producing the characters' early adventures set before the events of the original series.

In the 2016 one-shot "", numerous symbols and visual references to "Watchmen", such as the blood-splattered smiley face, and the dialogue between Doctor Manhattan and Ozymandias in the last issue of "Watchmen" is shown. Further Watchmen imagery was added in the "DC Universe: Rebirth Special" #1 second printing, which featured an update to Gary Frank's cover, better revealing the outstretched hand of <a href="Doctor%20Manhattan">Doctor Manhattan</a> in the top right corner. Doctor Manhattan later appeared in the 2017 four-part DC miniseries "<a href="The%20Button%20%28comics%29">The Button</a>" serving as a direct sequel to both "DC Universe Rebirth" and the 2011 storyline "<a href="Flashpoint%20%28comics%29">Flashpoint</a>". Manhattan reappears in the 2017–18 twelve-part sequel series <a href="Doomsday%20Clock%20%28comics%29">"Doomsday Clock"</a>.

In 1983, DC Comics acquired a line of characters from <a href="Charlton%20Comics">Charlton Comics</a>. During that period, writer <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, as he had done in his "<a href="Marvelman">Miracleman</a>" series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that <a href="MLJ%20Comics">MLJ Comics</a>' <a href="Mighty%20Crusaders">Mighty Crusaders</a> might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the <a href="Shield%20%28Archie%20Comics%29">Shield</a> in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them "so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled "Who Killed the <a href="Peacemaker%20%28comics%29">Peacemaker</a>", and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor <a href="Dick%20Giordano">Dick Giordano</a>. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers, but later changed his mind. He said, "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work."

Artist <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a>, who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects, recalled he "must have heard on the grapevine that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I’d like to be involved with what he was doing", and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist <a href="John%20Higgins%20%28comics%29">John Higgins</a> onto the project because he liked his "unusual" style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to "discuss [the art] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". <a href="Len%20Wein">Len Wein</a> joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?"

After receiving the go-ahead to work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>" parody of Superman named "<a href="Superduperman">Superduperman</a>"; Moore said, "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create "a superhero "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby Dick</a>"; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather "did it at odd times [...] spend[ing] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches." Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because "you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done."

Moore began writing the series very early on, hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series "<a href="Camelot%203000">Camelot 3000</a>". When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that "[t]he script for the first issue of "Watchmen" was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of "Watchmen", and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.

Despite his intentions, Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the stands, still writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the "piecemeal way" in which he received Moore's scripts. Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work "just several pages at a time. I'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, 'Feed me!' And he'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages." As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.

Near the end of the project, Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to "<a href="The%20Architects%20of%20Fear">The Architects of Fear</a>", an episode of "<a href="The%20Outer%20Limits%20%281963%20TV%20series%29">The Outer Limits</a>" television series. The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending, and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, "I kept telling him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't seem to care enough to do that." Moore acknowledged the "Outer Limits" episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.

"Watchmen" is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The <a href="point%20of%20divergence">point of divergence</a> occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and the presidency of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of "Watchmen" are commonly called "superheroes", only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities. The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a> not coming to pass. The <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a> occurs approximately six years later than in real life.

When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, which has dramatically increased <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named <a href="Rorschach%20%28comics%29">Rorschach</a> continues to operate outside the law.

In October 1985, New York City detectives are investigating the murder of Edward Blake. With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Discovering Blake to have been the true identity of The Comedian, a costumed hero employed by the U.S. government, Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades: Dan Dreiberg (formerly the second Nite Owl), the superpowered and emotionally detached Jon Osterman (codenamed Doctor Manhattan) and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk (the second Silk Spectre), and Adrian Veidt (once the hero <a href="Ozymandias%20%28comics%29">Ozymandias</a>, and now a successful businessman).

After Blake's funeral, Manhattan is accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As the U.S. depends on Manhattan as a strategic military asset, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviets invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt and Rorschach himself is framed and imprisoned for murdering a former supervillain named Moloch.

Neglected in her relationship with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings, and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg. They begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a>, the pair takes it upon themselves to break him out of prison. After looking back on his own personal history, Manhattan places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was, in fact, her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.

On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy and find evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, in which he has been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to "New Frontiersman", a local right-wing newspaper. The pair then confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war by faking an alien invasion in New York, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the superpowers against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.

When Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, they are confronted by mass destruction and death in New York, with a gigantic squid-like <a href="List%20of%20Watchmen%20characters%23Alien%20Monster">creature</a>, created by Veidt's laboratories, dead in the middle of the city. Manhattan notices his <a href="Precognition">prescient</a> abilities are limited by <a href="tachyon">tachyon</a>s emanating from the Antarctic and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing the truth is in the best interests of world peace. Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks him if he did the right thing in the end. Manhattan responds that "nothing ever ends" before leaving the Earth to create life elsewhere. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance.

Back in New York, the editor at "New Frontiersman" asks his assistant to find some filler material from the "crank file", a collection of rejected submissions to the paper, many of which have not been reviewed yet. The series ends with the young man reaching toward the pile of discarded submissions, near the top of which is Rorschach's journal.

With "Watchmen", Alan Moore's intention was to create four or five "radically opposing ways" to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of "[cramming] regurgitated morals" down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, "What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws."


Moore and Gibbons designed "Watchmen" to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that "Watchmen" was designed to be read "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, "[a]s it progressed, "Watchmen" became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a <a href="macguffin">macguffin</a>, a <a href="gimmick">gimmick</a> ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn't the most interesting thing about "Watchmen". As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in."

Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of "Watchmen" so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and "not some other comic book". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different from that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" which he hoped "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former <a href="Surveying">surveyor</a> for "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing". Gibbons described the series as "a comic about comics". Gibbons felt that "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [the presence of super-heroes] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding <a href="electric%20car">electric car</a>s, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of <a href="fire%20hydrant">fire hydrant</a>s, which Moore said, "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.

Colorist John Higgins used a template that was "moodier" and favored secondary colors. Moore stated that he had also "always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an <a href="airbrush">airbrush</a> colorist", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color "Watchmen" in European-style flat color. Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes; in issue six, Higgins began with "warm and cheerful" colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling.

Structurally, certain aspects of "Watchmen" deviated from the norm in comic books at the time, particularly the panel layout and the coloring. Instead of panels of various sizes, the creators divided each page into a nine-panel grid. Gibbons favored the nine-panel grid system due to its "authority". Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which "gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn't had previously", according to Gibbons. "There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect." <a href="Bhob%20Stewart">Bhob Stewart</a> of "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>" mentioned to Gibbons in 1987, that the page layouts recalled those of <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a>, in addition to the art itself, which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of <a href="John%20Severin">John Severin</a>. Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC-style layouts "was a very deliberate thing", although his inspiration was rather <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>, but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look. The artist also cited Steve Ditko's work on early issues of "<a href="The%20Amazing%20Spider-Man">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>" as an influence, as well as "<a href="Doctor%20Strange">Doctor Strange</a>", where "even at his most psychedelic [he] would still keep a pretty straight page layout".

The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story. Gibbons said, "The cover of the "Watchmen" is in the real world and looks quite real, but it's starting to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension." The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present. The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled "Fearful Symmetry", so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the following pages mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.

The end of each issue, with the exception of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various "Watchmen" characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of "Watchmen", which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it."

"Watchmen" features a <a href="story%20within%20a%20story">story within a story</a> in the form of "Tales of the Black Freighter", a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic's story, "Marooned", is read by a youth in New York City. Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of "Watchmen" experience superheroes in real life, "they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics." Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is "a big <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> fan": the "Black Freighter" alludes to the song "<a href="Pirate%20Jenny">Seeräuberjenny</a>" ("<a href="Pirate%20Jenny">Pirate Jenny</a>") from Brecht's "<a href="The%20Threepenny%20Opera">Threepenny Opera</a>". Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as "objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent—with EC riding the crest of the wave." Moore felt "the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of "Watchmen"". The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presence in the story would add <a href="subtext">subtext</a> and allegory. The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of "Tales of the Black Freighter" at the end of issue five credits real-life artist <a href="Joe%20Orlando">Joe Orlando</a> as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the "Watchmen" universe that DC editor <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.

In "Marooned", a young mariner (called "The Sea Captain") journeys to warn his hometown of the coming of "The Black Freighter", after he survives the destruction of his own ship. He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft. When he finally returns home, believing it to be already under the occupation of "The Black Freighter"s crew, he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home, mistaking her for a pirate. After realizing what he has done, he returns to the seashore, where he finds that "The Black Freighter" has not come to claim the town; it has come to claim him. He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship. According to Richard Reynold, the mariner is "forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another." Just like Adrian Veidt, he "hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal". Moore stated that the story of "The Black Freighter" ends up specifically describing "the story of Adrian Veidt" and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story, such as Rorschach's capture and Dr. Manhattan's self-exile on Mars.

Moore named <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a> as one of his main influences during the conception of "Watchmen". He admired Burroughs' use of "repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning" in Burroughs' only comic strip, "<a href="Ah%20Pook%20Is%20Here">The Unspeakable Mr. Hart</a>", which appeared in the British underground magazine "Cyclops". Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that "there's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read", while other "things [...] turned up in there by accident."
A stained <a href="Smiley">smiley face</a> is a recurring image in the story, appearing in many forms. In "The System of Comics", Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces "rhyme and remarkable configurations" by appearing in key segments of "Watchmen", notably the first and last pages of the series—spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a "recurrent geometric motif" and due to its symbolic connotations. Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to "lighten" the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as "a symbol for the whole series", noting its resemblance to the <a href="Doomsday%20Clock">Doomsday Clock</a> ticking up to midnight. Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of <a href="behaviorism">behaviorism</a>, explaining that the tests had presented the face as "a symbol of complete innocence". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that on "the little plugs on the spark hydrants if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face".

Other symbols, images, and allusions that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that "[t]he whole thing with "Watchmen" has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the <a href="Impact%20crater">craters</a> and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the <a href="Galle%20%28Martian%20crater%29">Galle crater</a>, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, "We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the "<a href="Gordian%20Knot">Gordian Knot</a> Lock Company".

The initial premise of the series was to examine what superheroes would be like "in a credible, real world". As the story became more complex, Moore said "Watchmen" became about "power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society." The title of the series refers to the question "Who watches the watchmen?", famously posed by the <a href="Latin%20literature">Roman</a> satirist <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> (as ""<a href="Quis%20custodiet%20ipsos%20custodes%3F">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a>""), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> informed him. Moore commented in 1987, "In the context of "Watchmen", that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them? The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of "Watchmen" that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.
Bradford Wright described "Watchmen" as "Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of "Watchmen" were Moore's "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to "the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagans</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Thatchers</a>, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing "Watchmen" to be "not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-<a href="Political%20positions%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reaganism</a>", specifically believing that "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]." While Moore wanted to write about "power politics" and the "worrying" times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would "switch off" if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy."

Citing "Watchmen" as the point where the comic book medium "came of age", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay "Deconstructing the Hero" that the story accomplished this by "developing its heroes precisely in order to "deconstruct" the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground". Thomson stated that the heroes in "Watchmen" almost all share a <a href="nihilism">nihilistic</a> outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook "as the simple, unvarnished truth" to "deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality". He wrote that the story "develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes". Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept "suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed", which he feels distinguishes "this postmodern work" from the deconstructions of the hero in the <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a> movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of "Watchmen" are forced to confront "more intangible social and moral concerns", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre "all mark out "Watchmen" either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre".

Geoff Klock eschewed the term "deconstruction" in favor of describing "Watchmen" as a "revisionary superhero narrative". He considers "Watchmen" and <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s "" to be "the first instances [...] of [a] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature." He elaborates by noting that "Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a "<a href="kenosis">kenosis</a>" towards comic book history [...] [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world". First and foremost, "Moore's exploration of the [often sexual] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate—to revision—every superhero in terms of Moore's "kenosis"—his emptying out of the tradition". Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself. The deconstructive nature of "Watchmen" is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, "[l]ike Alan Moore's "kenosis", [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.

Moore has expressed dismay that "[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by "Watchmen" [...] became a genre". He said in 2003 that "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since "Watchmen", an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use "Watchmen" to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them". Gibbons said that while readers "were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing", he said in his view the series was "a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else".

"Watchmen" was first mentioned publicly in the 1985 "<a href="Amazing%20Heroes">Amazing Heroes</a> Preview". When Moore and Gibbons turned in the first issue of their series to DC, Gibbons recalled, "What really clinched it [...] was [writer/artist] <a href="Howard%20Chaykin">Howard Chaykin</a>, who doesn't give praise lightly, and who came up and said, 'Dave what you've done on "Watchmen" is fuckin' A.'" Speaking in 1986, Moore said, "DC backed us all the way [...] and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses". To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained <a href="Smiley">smiley face</a> badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. <a href="Mayfair%20Games">Mayfair Games</a> introduced a "Watchmen" module for its "<a href="DC%20Heroes">DC Heroes</a>" Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.

"Watchmen" was published in single-issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987. The <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a> was a commercial success, and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> in the comic book direct market. The series' publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six editor <a href="Len%20Wein">Len Wein</a> believed were necessary. Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete. One contemporaneous report noted that although DC solicited issue #12 for publication in April 1987, it became apparent "it won't debut until July or August".

After the series concluded, the individual issues were collected and sold in <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a> form. Along with <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s 1986 "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>" miniseries, "Watchmen" was marketed as a "<a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>", a term that allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels and dissociated them from comics. As a result of the publicity given to the books like the "Watchmen" trade in 1987, bookstore and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them. Subsequently, new comics series were commissioned on the basis of reprinting them in a collected form for these markets.

"Watchmen" received critical praise, both inside and outside of the comics industry. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, which noted that the series was "by common assent the best of breed" of the new wave of comics published at the time, praised "Watchmen" as "a superlative feat of imagination, combining sci-fi, political satire, knowing evocations of comics past and bold reworkings of current graphic formats into a mystery story". In 1988, "Watchmen" received a <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> in the Other Forms category.

Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a <a href="work%20for%20hire">work for hire</a> arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for "Watchmen". Speaking at the 1985 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, Moore said: "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we can make all the money from the <a href="Slurpee">Slurpee</a> cups." For "Watchmen", Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them "a substantial amount of money" to retain the rights. Moore added, "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with."

Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for "Watchmen" and his "<a href="V%20for%20Vendetta">V for Vendetta</a>" series with artist <a href="David%20Lloyd%20%28comics%29">David Lloyd</a>. Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print. He told "The New York Times" in 2006, "I said, 'Fair enough,' [...] 'You have managed to successfully swindle me, and so I will never work for you again. In 2000, Moore publicly distanced himself from DC's plans for a 15th anniversary "Watchmen" hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from <a href="DC%20Direct">DC Direct</a>. While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer, Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his <a href="America%27s%20Best%20Comics">America's Best Comics</a> imprint (launched under the <a href="WildStorm">WildStorm</a> comic <a href="Imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a>, which was bought by DC in 1998; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement). Moore added, "As far as I'm concerned, the 15th anniversary of Watchmen is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave [Gibbons]." Soon afterward, DC Direct cancelled the "Watchmen" action-figure line, despite the company having displayed prototypes at the 2000 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>.

Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12-issue <a href="prequel">prequel</a> series called "Minutemen" featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as "Rorschach's Journal" or "The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary", as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because "<a href="The%20%27Nam">The 'Nam</a>" was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" (in the manner of "<a href="Randall%20and%20Hopkirk%20%28Deceased%29">Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)</a>"). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a "Minutemen" series because it would have "[paid] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how we got to the conclusion."

In 2010, Moore told "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" that DC offered him the rights to "Watchmen" back if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that "if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked [...] But these days I don't want "Watchmen" back. Certainly, I don't want it back under those kinds of terms." DC Comics co-publishers <a href="Dan%20DiDio">Dan DiDio</a> and <a href="Jim%20Lee">Jim Lee</a> responded: "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves." Following months of rumors about a potential "Watchmen" follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the "Before Watchmen" banner. Among the creators involved are writers <a href="J.%20Michael%20Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>, <a href="Brian%20Azzarello">Brian Azzarello</a>, <a href="Darwyn%20Cooke">Darwyn Cooke</a>, and <a href="Len%20Wein">Len Wein</a>, and artists <a href="Lee%20Bermejo">Lee Bermejo</a>, <a href="J.%20G.%20Jones">J. G. Jones</a>, <a href="Adam%20Hughes">Adam Hughes</a>, <a href="Andy%20Kubert">Andy Kubert</a>, <a href="Joe%20Kubert">Joe Kubert</a>, and <a href="Amanda%20Conner">Amanda Conner</a>. Though Moore has no involvement, Gibbons gave the project his blessing.

The sequel to "Watchmen", entitled "Doomsday Clock", is part of the <a href="DC%20Rebirth">DC Rebirth</a> line of comics, additionally continuing a narrative established with 2016's one-shot "" and 2017's crossover "<a href="The%20Button%20%28comics%29">The Button</a>", both of which featured <a href="Doctor%20Manhattan">Doctor Manhattan</a> in a minor capacity. The miniseries, taking place seven years after the events of "Watchmen" in November 1992, follows a cancer-ridden <a href="Ozymandias%20%28comics%29">Ozymandias</a> as he attempts to locate Doctor Manhattan alongside Reginald Long, the successor of Walter Kovacs as Rorschach, following the exposure and subsequent failure of his plan for peace and the subsequent impending <a href="nuclear%20war">nuclear war</a> between the United States and Russia. The series was revealed on May 14, 2017, with a teaser image displaying the <a href="Superman%20logo">Superman logo</a> in the 12 o'clock slot of the clock depicted in "Watchmen" and the series title in the bold typeface used for "Watchmen". The first of a planned twelve issues was released on November 22, 2017.

The story will include many DC characters but has a particular focus on <a href="Superman">Superman</a> and <a href="Doctor%20Manhattan">Doctor Manhattan</a>, despite Superman stated as being a fictional character in the original series—the series uses the plot element of the <a href="Multiverse%20%28DC%20Comics%29">multiverse</a>. Johns felt like there was an interesting story to be told in Rebirth with Doctor Manhattan. He thought there was an interesting dichotomy between Superman—an alien who embodies and is compassionate for humanity—and Doctor Manhattan—a human who has detached himself from humanity. This led to over six months of debates amongst the creative team about whether to intersect the "Watchmen" universe with the DC Universe, through the plot element of alternate realities. He explained that "Doomsday Clock" was the "most personal and most epic, utterly mind-bending project" that he had worked on in his career.

There have been numerous attempts to make a film version of "Watchmen" since 1986, when producers <a href="Lawrence%20Gordon%20%28producer%29">Lawrence Gordon</a> and <a href="Joel%20Silver">Joel Silver</a> acquired film rights to the series for <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a>. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing "Watchmen"'s complicated ending into a "more manageable" conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into <a href="turnaround%20%28filmmaking%29">turnaround</a> in 1991, and the project was moved to <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, where <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> was attached to direct and <a href="Charles%20McKeown">Charles McKeown</a> to rewrite it. They used the character Rorschach's diary as a <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise $25 million for the film (a quarter of the necessary budget) because their previous films had gone over budget. Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that "Watchmen" would have been unfilmable. "Reducing [the story] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about." he said. After Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a>.
In October 2001, Gordon partnered with <a href="Lloyd%20Levin">Lloyd Levin</a> and <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>, hiring <a href="David%20Hayter">David Hayter</a> to write and direct. Hayter and the producers left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up "Watchmen" at <a href="Revolution%20Studios">Revolution Studios</a>. The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart. In July 2004, it was announced <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> would produce "Watchmen", and they attached <a href="Darren%20Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a> to direct Hayter's script. Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Aronofsky left to focus on "<a href="The%20Fountain">The Fountain</a>" and was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Greengrass">Paul Greengrass</a>. Ultimately, Paramount placed "Watchmen" in turnaround.

In October 2005, Gordon and Levin met with Warner Bros. to develop the film there again. Impressed with <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a>'s work on "<a href="300%20%28film%29">300</a>", Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of "Watchmen". Screenwriter <a href="Alex%20Tse">Alex Tse</a> drew from his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> setting of the "Watchmen" comic. Similar to his approach to "300", Snyder used the comic book panel-grid as a <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> and opted to shoot the entire film using live-action sets instead of <a href="green%20screens">green screens</a>. He extended the fight scenes, and added a <a href="subplot">subplot</a> about energy resources to make the film more topical. Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic, Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier, and made Ozymandias' armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>". After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president <a href="Paul%20Levitz">Paul Levitz</a> said that the company had to print more than 900,000 copies of "Watchmen" trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film's release, the studios eventually settled, with Warner agreeing to give Fox 8.5 percent of the film's worldwide gross, including from sequels and spin-offs in return. The film was released to theaters in March 2009.

The "Tales of the Black Freighter" segments were adapted as a <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> animated feature to be released that same month. <a href="Gerard%20Butler">Gerard Butler</a>, who starred in "300", voices the Captain in the film. The film itself was released on DVD four months after "Tales of the Black Freighter", and in November 2009, a four-disc set was released as the "Ultimate Cut" with the animated film edited back into the main picture. Len Wein, the comic's editor, wrote a video game prequel entitled "".

Dave Gibbons became an adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore has refused to have his name attached to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he has no interest in seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told "Entertainment Weekly" in 2008 that "[t]here are things that we did with "Watchmen" that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was "as close as I could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.

<a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> announced in April 2017 that it is developing an <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">R-rated</a> animated movie based on the comic book.

In 2008, Warner Bros. Entertainment released "Watchmen Motion Comics", a series of narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase in the summer of 2008 on digital video stores, such as <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>. A DVD compiling the full <a href="motion%20comic">motion comic</a> series was released in March 2009.

According to media sources, <a href="HBO">HBO</a> met with Snyder to discuss a potential "Watchmen" television series. On June 20, 2017, <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> was announced as showrunner in the early development stages of the show. Zack Snyder is no longer attached to the show. Lindelof said his interest towards the story and the characters were a result of his father giving him the comic when he was twelve years old. On August 17, 2018, it was ordered to series at HBO, targeting a 2019 release.

A critical and commercial success, "Watchmen" is highly regarded in the comics industry and is frequently considered by several critics and reviewers as comics' greatest series and graphic novel. In time, the series has also become one of the best-selling graphic novels ever published. "Watchmen" was the only graphic novel to appear on "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s 2005 "All-"Time" 100 Greatest Novels" list, where "Time" critic Lev Grossman described the story as "a heart-pounding, heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium." It later appeared on "Time"s 2009 "Top 10 Graphic Novels" list, where Grossman further praised "Watchmen", proclaiming "It’s way beyond cliché at this point to call Watchmen the greatest superhero comic ever written-slash-drawn. But it’s true." In 2008, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" placed "Watchmen" at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years, describing it as "The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart, emotionally resonant narratives worthy of the label 'literature'." "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>", however, ranked "Watchmen" at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century.

In "Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History", Robert Harvey wrote that, with "Watchmen", Moore and Gibbons "had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the [comic book] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics". In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that the dark legacy of "Watchmen", "one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book," is "a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones." Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like "<a href="Marvelman">Marvelman</a>" and "Watchmen" were to liberate comics and open them up to new and fresh ideas, thus creating more diversity in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts. Instead it had the opposite effect, causing the superhero comic to end up stuck in a "depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis". In 2009, Lydia Millet of "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" contested that "Watchmen" was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series' "vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate", that "it's simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like <a href="Chris%20Ware">Chris Ware</a>'s '<a href="Acme%20Novelty%20Library">Acme Novelty Library</a>' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of <a href="Edward%20Gorey">Edward Gorey</a>".

"Watchmen" was one of the two comic books, alongside "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>", that inspired designer <a href="Vincent%20Connare">Vincent Connare</a> when he created the <a href="Comic%20Sans">Comic Sans</a> font.

In 2009, Brain Scan Studios released the parody "<a href="Watchmensch">Watchmensch</a>", a comic in which writer <a href="Rich%20Johnston">Rich Johnston</a> chronicled "the debate surrounding Watchmen, the original contracts, the current legal suits over the Fox contract".

In September 2016, Hasslein Books published "Watching Time: The Unauthorized Watchmen Chronology", by author Rich Handley. The book provides a detailed history of the Watchmen franchise.

In December 2017, DC Entertainment published "Watchmen: Annotated", a fully annotated black-and-white edition of the graphic novel, edited, with an introduction and notes by <a href="Leslie%20S.%20Klinger">Leslie S. Klinger</a> (who previously annotated Neil Gaiman's "<a href="The%20Sandman%20%28Vertigo%29">The Sandman</a>" for DC). The edition contains extensive materials from Alan Moore's original scripts and was written with the full collaboration of Dave Gibbons.

William the Conqueror

William I (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1028 – 9 September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard, was the first <a href="House%20of%20Normandy">Norman</a> <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. A descendant of <a href="Rollo">Rollo</a>, he was <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a> from 1035 onward. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> was secure, and he launched the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a> six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son.

William was the son of the unmarried <a href="Robert%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Robert I, Duke of Normandy</a>, by Robert's mistress <a href="Herleva">Herleva</a>. His <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a> status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda of Flanders</a> provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring <a href="county%20of%20Flanders">county of Flanders</a>. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William secured control of the neighbouring county of <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>.

In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, his <a href="first%20cousin%20once%20removed">first cousin once removed</a>. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, and by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent.

William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>", a survey listing all the landholdings in England along with their pre-Conquest and current holders. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in <a href="Caen">Caen</a>. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>, and his second surviving son, <a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a>, received England.

<a href="Viking">Norsemen</a> first began raiding in what became <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when <a href="Rollo">Rollo</a>, one of the Viking leaders, and King <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a> of France reached an agreement surrendering the <a href="county%20of%20Rouen">county of Rouen</a> to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy. Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy. In an effort to improve matters, King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a> took <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Emma of Normandy</a>, sister of Duke <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20Normandy">Richard II</a>, as his second wife in 1002.

Danish raids on England continued, and Æthelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when King <a href="Swein%20Forkbeard">Swein I of Denmark</a> drove Æthelred and his family from England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed Æthelred to return home, but Swein's son <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> contested Æthelred's return. Æthelred died unexpectedly in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. Æthelred and Emma's two sons, <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Aetheling">Alfred</a>, went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.

After Cnut's death in 1035, the English throne fell to <a href="Harold%20Harefoot">Harold Harefoot</a>, his son by his first wife, while <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a>, his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England remained unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl <a href="Godwin%20of%20Wessex">Godwin of Wessex</a> in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.

William was born in 1027 or 1028 at <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>, Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028. He was the only son of <a href="Robert%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke Robert I</a>, son of <a href="Richard%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke Richard II</a>. His mother, <a href="Herleva">Herleva</a>, was the daughter of <a href="Fulbert%20of%20Falaise">Fulbert of Falaise</a>; Fulbert may have been a tanner or embalmer. She was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert. Instead, she later married <a href="Herluin%20de%20Conteville">Herluin de Conteville</a>, with whom she had two sons – <a href="Odo%20of%20Bayeux">Odo of Bayeux</a> and <a href="Robert%2C%20Count%20of%20Mortain">Robert, Count of Mortain</a> – and a daughter whose name is unknown. One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority. Robert also had a daughter, <a href="Adelaide%20of%20Normandy">Adelaide</a>, by another mistress.

Robert became Duke of Normandy on 6 August 1027, succeeding his elder brother <a href="Richard%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Richard III</a>, who had only succeeded to the title the previous year. Robert and his brother had been at odds over the succession, and Richard's death was sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing his brother, a plausible but now unprovable charge. Conditions in Normandy were unsettled, as noble families despoiled the Church and <a href="Alan%20III%20of%20Brittany">Alan III of Brittany</a> waged war against the duchy, possibly in an attempt to take control. By 1031 Robert had gathered considerable support from noblemen, many of whom would become prominent during William's life. They included Robert's uncle, <a href="Robert%20II%20%28Archbishop%20of%20Rouen%29">Robert</a> the <a href="archbishop%20of%20Rouen">archbishop of Rouen</a>, who had originally opposed the duke, <a href="Osbern%20the%20Steward">Osbern</a>, a nephew of <a href="Gunnora%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Normandy">Gunnor</a> the wife of Duke Richard I, and Count <a href="Gilbert%2C%20Count%20of%20Brionne">Gilbert of Brionne</a>, a grandson of Richard I. After his accession, Robert continued Norman support for the English princes Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.

There are indications that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a>, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at <a href="%C4%B0znik">Nicea</a>, on his way back to Normandy.

William faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the evidence indicates that he was either seven or eight years old at the time. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20France">Henry I</a>, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.

The anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047, and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil, was also killed around the time of Gilbert's death. Yet another guardian, Osbern, was slain in the early 1040s in William's chamber while the duke slept. It was said that Walter, William's maternal uncle, was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants, although this story may be an embellishment by <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a>. The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career – <a href="William%20fitzOsbern">William fitzOsbern</a>, <a href="Roger%20de%20Beaumont">Roger de Beaumont</a>, and <a href="Roger%20of%20Montgomery">Roger of Montgomery</a>. Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William's minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William.

King Henry continued to support the young duke, but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy, led by <a href="Guy%20of%20Burgundy">Guy of Burgundy</a> with support from Nigel, Viscount of the Cotentin, and Ranulf, Viscount of the Bessin. According to stories that may have legendary elements, an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes, but he escaped under cover of darkness, seeking refuge with King Henry. In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Val-%C3%A8s-Dunes">Battle of Val-ès-Dunes</a> near <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, although few details of the actual fighting are recorded. William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William's efforts, but earlier accounts claim that King Henry's men and leadership also played an important part. William assumed power in Normandy, and shortly after the battle promulgated the <a href="Peace%20and%20Truce%20of%20God%23Truce%20of%20God">Truce of God</a> throughout his duchy, in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted. Although the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes marked a turning point in William's control of the duchy, it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare, with lesser crises continuing until 1060.

William's next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at <a href="Brionne">Brionne</a>, which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050. To address the growing power of the Count of <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Martel">Geoffrey Martel</a>, William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress, but accomplished little else. Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>, especially after the death of <a href="Hugh%20IV%20of%20Maine">Hugh IV of Maine</a> in 1051. Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the <a href="House%20of%20Bell%C3%AAme">Bellême family</a>, who held <a href="Bell%C3%AAme">Bellême</a> on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at <a href="Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a> and <a href="Domfront%2C%20Orne">Domfront</a>. Bellême's overlord was the king of France, but Domfort was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon's overlord. The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves.

On the death of Hugh of Maine, Geoffrey Martel occupied Maine in a move contested by William and King Henry; eventually, they succeeded in driving Geoffrey from the county, and in the process, William was able to secure the Bellême family strongholds at Alençon and Domfort for himself. He was thus able to assert his overlordship over the Bellême family and compel them to act consistently in Norman interests. But in 1052 the king and Geoffrey Martel made common cause against William at the same time as some Norman nobles began to contest William's increasing power. Henry's about-face was probably motivated by a desire to retain dominance over Normandy, which was now threatened by William's growing mastery of his duchy. William was engaged in military actions against his own nobles throughout 1053, as well as with the new Archbishop of Rouen, <a href="Mauger%20%28archbishop%29">Mauger</a>. In February 1054 the king and the Norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy. Henry led the main thrust through the <a href="Count%20of%20%C3%89vreux">county of Évreux</a>, while the other wing, under the French king's brother <a href="Odo%20%28son%20of%20Robert%20II%20of%20France%29">Odo</a>, invaded eastern Normandy.

William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two groups. The first, which he led, faced Henry. The second, which included some who became William's firm supporters, such as <a href="Counts%20of%20Eu">Robert, Count of Eu</a>, <a href="Walter%20Giffard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Longueville">Walter Giffard</a>, <a href="Roger%20of%20Mortemer">Roger of Mortemer</a>, and <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William de Warenne</a>, faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mortemer">Battle of Mortemer</a>. In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke's ecclesiastical supporters to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen. Mortemer thus marked another turning point in William's growing control of the duchy, although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060. Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Varaville">Battle of Varaville</a>. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William's lifetime. In 1058, William invaded the <a href="County%20of%20Dreux">County of Dreux</a> and took <a href="Tilli%C3%A8res-sur-Avre">Tillières-sur-Avre</a> and <a href="Thimert">Thimert</a>. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the <a href="Siege%20of%20Thimert">Siege of Thimert</a> dragged on for two years until Henry's death. The deaths of Count Geoffrey and the king in 1060 cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William.

One factor in William's favour was his marriage to <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda of Flanders</a>, the daughter of Count <a href="Baldwin%20V%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin V of Flanders</a>. The union was arranged in 1049, but <a href="Pope%20Leo%20IX">Pope Leo IX</a> forbade the marriage at the <a href="Council%20of%20Rheims">Council of Rheims</a> in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead some time in the early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen – one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.

No authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the <a href="Bayeux%20Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life. He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and as a horseman. Examination of William's <a href="femur">femur</a>, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately in height.

There are records of two tutors for the young duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's literary education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and there is little evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her – unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.

Norman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, which consisted of a group of officers including <a href="Butler">stewards</a>, <a href="butler">butler</a>s, and <a href="marshal">marshal</a>ls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming <a href="charter">charter</a>s and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.

William cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy. He took part in church councils and made several appointments to the Norman episcopate, including the appointment of <a href="Maurilius">Maurilius</a> as Archbishop of Rouen. Another important appointment was that of William's half-brother Odo as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a> in either 1049 or 1050. He also relied on the clergy for advice, including <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, a non-Norman who rose to become one of William's prominent ecclesiastical advisors in the late 1040s and remained so throughout the 1050s and 1060s. William gave generously to the church; from 1035 to 1066, the Norman aristocracy founded at least 20 new monastic houses, including William's 2 monasteries in Caen, a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy.

In 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor to the English throne. William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, <a href="Richard%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Richard II, Duke of Normandy</a>. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", in the "D" version, states that William visited England in the later part of 1051, perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession, or perhaps William was attempting to secure aid for his troubles in Normandy. The trip is unlikely given William's absorption in warfare with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward's wishes, it was likely that any claim by William would be opposed by Godwin, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Wessex">Earl of Wessex</a>, a member of the most powerful family in England. Edward had married <a href="Edith%20of%20Wessex">Edith</a>, Godwin's daughter, in 1043, and Godwin appears to have been one of the main supporters of Edward's claim to the throne. By 1050, however, relations between the king and the earl had soured, culminating in a crisis in 1051 that led to the exile of Godwin and his family from England. It was during this exile that Edward offered the throne to William. Godwin returned from exile in 1052 with armed forces, and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl, restoring the earl and his family to their lands and replacing <a href="Robert%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">Robert of Jumièges</a>, a Norman whom Edward had named <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, with <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. No English source mentions a supposed embassy by Archbishop Robert to William conveying the promise of the succession, and the two Norman sources that mention it, <a href="William%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">William of Jumièges</a> and <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a>, are not precise in their chronology of when this visit took place.

Count <a href="Herbert%20II%20of%20Maine">Herbert II of Maine</a> died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed his eldest son <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert</a> to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles resisted the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Le%20Mans">bishopric of Le Mans</a> in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, <a href="Geoffrey%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey the Bearded</a>. William's western border was thus secured, but his border with <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a> remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, <a href="Conan%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Conan II</a>, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles who went on to support the invasion of England in 1066.

In England, Earl Godwin died in 1053 and his sons were increasing in power: <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold</a> succeeded to his father's earldom, and another son, <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig</a>, became <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a>. Other sons were granted earldoms later: <a href="Gyrth%20Godwinson">Gyrth</a> as <a href="Earl%20of%20East%20Anglia">Earl of East Anglia</a> in 1057 and <a href="Leofwine%20Godwinson">Leofwine</a> as <a href="Earl%20of%20Kent">Earl of Kent</a> some time between 1055 and 1057. Some sources claim that Harold took part in William's Breton campaign of 1064 and that Harold swore to uphold William's claim to the English throne at the end of the campaign, but no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward. Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged – <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, son of <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a> and a grandson of Æthelred II, returned to England in 1057, and although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters, <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Margaret</a> and <a href="Cristina%2C%20daughter%20of%20Edward%20the%20Exile">Christina</a>, and a son, <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a>.

In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and the rebels chose <a href="Morcar">Morcar</a>, the younger brother of <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Mercia">Earl of Mercia</a>, as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, supported the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, along with his wife <a href="Judith%20of%20Flanders%2C%20Countess%20of%20Northumbria">Judith</a>, who was the daughter of Count <a href="Baldwin%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin IV of Flanders</a>. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the "<a href="Vita%20%C3%86dwardi%20Regis">Vita Edwardi</a>", a biography of Edward, claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and <a href="Robert%20FitzWimarc">Robert FitzWimarc</a>, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.

Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new <a href="Norman%20architecture">Norman-style</a> <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that <a href="Ealdred%20%28bishop%29">Ealdred</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy. Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, however, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig. King <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King <a href="Magnus%20I%20of%20Norway">Magnus I</a>, who had made a pact with Harthacnut in about 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed. The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.

Harold's brother Tostig made probing attacks along the southern coast of England in May 1066, landing at the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> and near the <a href="River%20Humber">River Humber</a> met with no more success, so he retreated to Scotland, where he remained for a time. According to the Norman writer William of Jumièges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson to remind Harold of his oath to support William's claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold assembled an army and a fleet to repel William's anticipated invasion force, deploying troops and ships along the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> for most of the summer.

William of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Pope Alexander II</a> for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a> and King <a href="Sweyn%20II%20of%20Denmark">Sweyn II of Denmark</a>. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion.

Throughout the summer, William assembled an army and an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumièges's claim that the ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, it was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumièges disagree about where the fleet was built – Poitiers states it was constructed at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Dives">River Dives</a>, while Jumièges states it was built at <a href="Saint-Valery-sur-Somme">Saint-Valery-sur-Somme</a> – both agree that it eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force that included, in addition to troops from William's own territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies, and volunteers from <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, northeastern France, and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing. Harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer, but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8 September.

Harold's brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada invaded <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fulford">Battle of Fulford</a> near <a href="York">York</a>. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a>. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at <a href="Pevensey%20Bay">Pevensey Bay</a> on 28 September. William then moved to <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.

After defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the distance of approximately . Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day <a href="Battle%2C%20East%20Sussex">Battle, East Sussex</a>), about from William's castle at Hastings.

The battle began at about 9 am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although the numbers on each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a <a href="shield%20wall">shield wall</a> along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's <a href="Breton%20people">Breton</a> troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.

Harold's body was identified the day after the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of <a href="House%20of%20Godwin">Harold's brothers</a> and his <a href="housecarl">housecarl</a>s, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. <a href="Waltham%20Abbey%20%28abbey%29">Waltham Abbey</a>, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.

William may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, parts of Kent, and <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, while also sending a force to capture <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, where the royal treasury was. These captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. William then marched to <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, across the <a href="Thames">Thames</a> from London, which he reached in late November. Next he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a> in early December. Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a> soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.

William remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a> (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed. Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand. But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings. By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, <a href="William%20FitzOsbern%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">William fitzOsbern</a>, the son of his former guardian. Both men were also named to earldoms – fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>s. Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Fecamp">Abbey of Fecamp</a>, and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.

While William was in Normandy, a former ally, <a href="Eustace%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a>, invaded at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> but was repulsed. English resistance had also begun, with <a href="Eadric%20the%20Wild">Eadric the Wild</a> attacking <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a> and revolts at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, where Harold's mother Gytha was a focus of resistance. FitzOsbern and Odo found it difficult to control the native population and undertook a programme of castle building to maintain their hold on the kingdom. William returned to England in December 1067 and marched on Exeter, which he besieged. The town held out for 18 days, and after it fell to William he built a castle to secure his control. Harold's sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. Their forces landed near <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> but were defeated by <a href="Eadnoth%20the%20Constable">Eadnoth</a>. By Easter, William was at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.

In 1068 Edwin and Morcar revolted, supported by <a href="Gospatric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Gospatric</a>. The chronicler Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of William fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin's power within his own earldom. The king marched through Edwin's lands and built a castle at <a href="Warwick%20Castle">Warwick</a>. Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building castles at <a href="York%20Castle">York</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">Nottingham</a> before returning south. On his southbound journey, the king began constructing castles at <a href="Lincoln%20Castle">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Huntingdon%20Castle">Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Cambridge%20Castle">Cambridge</a>. William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications – among them <a href="William%20Peverel">William Peverel</a> at Nottingham and <a href="Henry%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Henry de Beaumont</a> at Warwick. Then the king returned to Normandy late in 1068.

Early in 1069, Edgar the Ætheling rose in revolt and attacked York. Although William returned to York and built another castle, Edgar remained free, and in the autumn he joined up with King Sweyn of Denmark. The Danish king had brought a large fleet to England and attacked not only York but Exeter and <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>. York was captured by the combined forces of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters, but William responded swiftly, ignoring a continental revolt in Maine. William symbolically wore his crown in the ruins of York on Christmas Day 1069, and then proceeded to buy off the Danes. He marched to the <a href="River%20Tees">River Tees</a>, ravaging the countryside as he went. Edgar, having lost much of his support, fled to Scotland, where King <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm III</a> was married to Edgar's sister Margaret. Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, along with Gospatric, and both were allowed to retain their lands. But William was not finished; he marched over the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a> during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at Shrewsbury before building castles at <a href="Chester%20Castle">Chester</a> and <a href="Stafford%20Castle">Stafford</a>. This campaign, which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through, is usually known as the "<a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a>"; it was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ceremonially for Easter at Winchester.

While at Winchester in 1070, William met with three <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s – John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion – who had been sent by the pope. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court. The historian <a href="David%20Bates%20%28historian%29">David Bates</a> sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal "seal of approval" for William's conquest. The legates and the king then proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, <a href="%C3%86thelm%C3%A6r%20of%20Elmham">Æthelmær</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Elmham">Bishop of Elmham</a>, were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a>. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and <a href="Thomas%20of%20Bayeux">Thomas of Bayeux</a> as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069. William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member. Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc. Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only two native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor. In 1070 William also founded <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a>, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead.

Although Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in spring 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Isle of Ely</a>, where he joined up with <a href="Hereward%20the%20Wake">Hereward the Wake</a>, a local <a href="thegn">thegn</a>. Hereward's forces attacked <a href="Peterborough%20Abbey">Peterborough Abbey</a>, which they captured and looted. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count <a href="Baldwin%20VI%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin VI of Flanders</a> in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, <a href="Richilde%2C%20Countess%20of%20Hainaut">Richilde</a>, was ruling for their two young sons, <a href="Arnulf%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Arnulf</a> and <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Hainaut">Baldwin</a>. Her rule, however, was contested by <a href="Robert%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Robert</a>, Baldwin's brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cassel%20%281071%29">Battle of Cassel</a>, Robert became count. He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France in addition to costing William an important supporter.

In 1071 William defeated the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Abernethy">Treaty of Abernethy</a>, and Malcolm probably gave up his son <a href="Duncan%20II%20of%20Scotland">Duncan</a> as a hostage for the peace. Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm's court. William then turned his attention to the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by <a href="Fulk%20le%20Rechin">Fulk le Rechin</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Anjou">Count of Anjou</a>. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister <a href="Bertha%20of%20Holland">Bertha</a> to the king of France, <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20France">Philip I</a>, who was opposed to Norman power.

William returned to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly returned to Normandy, where he spent all of 1074. He left England in the hands of his supporters, including <a href="Richard%20fitzGilbert">Richard fitzGilbert</a> and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of <a href="Montreuil-sur-Mer">Montreuil-sur-Mer</a> on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.

In 1075, during William's absence, <a href="Ralph%20de%20Gael">Ralph de Gael</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Earl of Norfolk</a>, and <a href="Roger%20de%20Breteuil%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Roger de Breteuil</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Hereford">Earl of Hereford</a>, conspired to overthrow William in the "Revolt of the Earls". Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands. Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held. Ralph's authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt.

The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger, held at <a href="Exning">Exning</a> in Suffolk. Another earl, Waltheof, the earl of Northumbria, although one of William's favourites, was also involved, and there were some Breton lords who were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by <a href="Wulfstan%20%28died%201095%29">Wulfstan</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, and <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a>, the <a href="Abbot%20of%20Evesham">Abbot of Evesham</a>. Ralph was bottled up in <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a> by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Montbray">Geoffrey de Montbray</a>, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the control of his wife and left England, finally ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, <a href="Canute%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Cnut</a>, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home. William returned to England later in 1075 to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. He celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. Before this, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.

Earl Ralph had secured control of the castle at <a href="Dol-de-Bretagne">Dol</a>, and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dol%20%281076%29">Battle of Dol</a>, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of <a href="Simon%20de%20Cr%C3%A9py">Simon de Crépy</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Amiens">Count of Amiens</a>, to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the <a href="Vexin">Vexin</a> over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.

In late 1077 or early 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William</a> and <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry</a>, including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them was <a href="Robert%20of%20Belleme">Robert of Belleme</a>, <a href="William%20de%20Breteuil">William de Breteuil</a>, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at <a href="Remalard">Remalard</a>, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at <a href="Gerberoi">Gerberoi</a>, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces <a href="sortie">sallied</a> from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman, Toki son of Wigod, who was himself killed. William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.
Word of William's defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the <a href="River%20Tweed">River Tweed</a>, devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of <a href="Walcher">Walcher</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> and Earl of Northumbria. The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080, and William dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion. William departed Normandy in July 1080, and in the autumn William's son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building a fortification at <a href="Newcastle-on-Tyne">Newcastle-on-Tyne</a> while returning to England. The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for Whitsun in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that William rejected. William also visited Wales during 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to <a href="St%20Davids">St Davids</a> in honour of <a href="Saint%20David">Saint David</a>. William's biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely, explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and that William would have wished to take advantage of the changed circumstances to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.

Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.

Maine continued to be difficult, with a rebellion by <a href="Hubert%20de%20Beaumont-au-Maine">Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine</a>, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at <a href="Siege%20of%20Saint-Suzanne%2C%201083-1086">Sainte-Suzanne</a> by William's forces for at least two years, but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear – he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the <a href="danegeld">danegeld</a> assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King <a href="Cnut%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Cnut IV of Denmark</a>. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.

As part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many <a href="castle">castle</a>s, <a href="keep">keep</a>s, and <a href="motte-and-bailey">mottes</a> built – among them the central keep of the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, the <a href="White%20Tower%20%28Tower%20of%20London%29">White Tower</a>. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.

At first, most of the newly settled Normans kept household <a href="knight">knight</a>s and did not settle their retainers with <a href="fief">fief</a>s of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, a process known as <a href="subinfeudation">subinfeudation</a>. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hide</a>.

By William's death, after weathering a series of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy had been replaced by Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.

The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> says that the king also seized and depopulated many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a> region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the <a href="Royal%20forest">forest law</a> into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.

After 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His <a href="Seal%20%28emblem%29">seal</a> from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgment was made – further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of <a href="writ">writ</a>s, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.

William took over an English government that was more complex than the Norman system. England was divided into <a href="shire">shire</a>s or counties, which were further divided into either <a href="hundred%20%28county%20subdivision%29">hundreds</a> or <a href="wapentake">wapentake</a>s. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman <a href="viscount">viscount</a>. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed back and forth between the continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, and after that, he spent the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William's <a href="royal%20household">household</a>; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually, this was a member of William's close family – frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.

William continued the collection of danegeld, a land tax. This was an advantage for William, as it was the only universal tax collected by western European rulers during this period. It was an annual tax based on the value of landholdings, and it could be collected at differing rates. Most years saw the rate of two shillings per hide, but in crises, it could be increased to as much as six shillings per hide. Coinage between the various parts of his domains continued to be minted in different cycles and styles. English coins were generally of high silver content, with high artistic standards, and were required to be re-minted every three years. Norman coins had a much lower silver content, were often of poor artistic quality, and were rarely re-minted. Also, in England, no other coinage was allowed, while on the continent other coinage was considered <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>. Nor is there evidence that many English <a href="pennies">pennies</a> were circulating in Normandy, which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems of England and Normandy.

Besides taxation, William's large landholdings throughout England strengthened his rule. As King Edward's heir, he controlled all of the former royal lands. He also retained control of much of the lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by a wide margin.

At Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>". The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and <a href="River%20Ribble">River Ribble</a> are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the <a href="Oath%20of%20Salisbury">Salisbury Oath</a>, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.

William left England towards the end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter <a href="Constance%20of%20Normandy">Constance</a> to <a href="Alan%20Fergant">Alan Fergant</a>, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing <a href="Mantes-la-Jolie">Mantes</a>, William either fell ill or was injured by the <a href="pommel%20%28saddle%29">pommel</a> of his saddle. He was taken to the <a href="priory">priory</a> of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the "<a href="De%20Obitu%20Willelmi">De Obitu Willelmi</a>", or "On the Death of William", has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.

William left Normandy to Robert, and the custody of England was given to William's second surviving son, also called William, on the assumption that he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts to the Church and money to be distributed to the poor. William also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.

Disorder followed William's death; everyone who had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired to be buried in his foundation of the <a href="Abbaye-aux-Hommes">Abbaye-aux-Hommes</a>. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations, the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.

William's grave is currently marked by a marble slab with a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the <a href="French%20Wars%20of%20Religion">French Wars of Religion</a>, the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> but was eventually replaced with the current marker.

The immediate consequence of William's death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy. Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tinchebray">Battle of Tinchebray</a> in 1106. The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William. His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter.

The impact on England of William's conquest was profound; changes in the Church, aristocracy, culture, and language of the country have persisted into modern times. The Conquest brought the kingdom into closer contact with France and forged ties between France and England that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. Another consequence of William's invasion was the sundering of the formerly close ties between England and Scandinavia. William's government blended elements of the English and Norman systems into a new one that laid the foundations of the later medieval English kingdom. How abrupt and far-reaching were the changes is still a matter of debate among historians, with some such as <a href="Richard%20Southern">Richard Southern</a> claiming that the Conquest was the single most radical change in European history between the Fall of Rome and the 20th century. Others, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, see the changes brought about by the Conquest as much less radical than Southern suggests. The historian Eleanor Searle describes William's invasion as "a plan that no ruler but a Scandinavian would have considered".

William's reign has caused historical controversy since before his death. William of Poitiers wrote glowingly of William's reign and its benefits, but the obituary notice for William in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" condemns William in harsh terms. In the years since the Conquest, politicians and other leaders have used William and the events of his reign to illustrate political events throughout English history. During the reign of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, Archbishop <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a> saw the Conquest as having corrupted a purer English Church, which Parker attempted to restore. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some historians and lawyers saw William's reign as imposing a "<a href="Norman%20yoke">Norman yoke</a>" on the native Anglo-Saxons, an argument that continued during the 19th century with further elaborations along nationalistic lines. These various controversies have led to William being seen by some historians either as one of the creators of England's greatness or as inflicting one of the greatest defeats in English history. Others have viewed William as an enemy of the English constitution, or alternatively as its creator.

William and his wife Matilda of Flanders had at least nine children. The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.


There is no evidence of any illegitimate children born to William.

Winter War

The Winter War was a military conflict between the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> (USSR) and <a href="Finland">Finland</a>. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and ended three and a half months later with the <a href="Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty">Moscow Peace Treaty</a> on 13 March 1940. The <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

The conflict began after the Soviets sought to obtain some Finnish territory, demanding among other concessions that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons—primarily the protection of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a>, from the Finnish border. Finland refused, and the USSR invaded the country. Many sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and use the establishment of the <a href="Finnish%20Democratic%20Republic">puppet Finnish Communist government</a> and the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>'s secret protocols as evidence of this, while other sources argue against the idea of the full Soviet conquest. Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders while temperatures ranged as low as . After the Soviet military reorganised and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February and overcame Finnish defences.

Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the <a href="Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty">Moscow Peace Treaty</a>. Finland ceded 11 percent of its territory representing 30 percent of its economy to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. Soviet gains exceeded their pre-war demands and the USSR received substantial territory along <a href="Lake%20Ladoga">Lake Ladoga</a> and in Northern Finland. Finland retained its <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> and enhanced its international reputation. The poor performance of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> encouraged <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to think that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military. After 15 months of <a href="Interim%20Peace">Interim Peace</a>, in June 1941, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> commenced <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> and the <a href="Continuation%20War">Continuation War</a> between Finland and the USSR began.

Until the beginning of the 19th century, Finland constituted the eastern part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sweden">Kingdom of Sweden</a>. In 1809, to protect its imperial capital, Saint Petersburg, the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> conquered Finland and converted it into an <a href="Autonomous%20entity">autonomous</a> <a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a>. The resulting <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland">Grand Duchy of Finland</a> enjoyed wide autonomy within the Empire until the end of the 19th century, when Russia began attempts <a href="Russification%20of%20Finland">to assimilate Finland</a> as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire through <a href="russification">russification</a>. These attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relations with the <a href="Finns">Finns</a> and increased support for Finnish self-determination movements.

<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> led to the collapse of the Russian Empire during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917 and the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> of 1917–1920, giving Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the <a href="Senate%20of%20Finland">Senate of Finland</a> <a href="Finland%27s%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declared the nation's independence</a>. The new <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> Russian Government was fragile, and civil war had broken out in Russia in November 1917; the Bolsheviks determined they could not hold onto peripheral parts of the old empire. Thus, <a href="Soviet%20Russia">Soviet Russia</a> (later the USSR) recognised the new Finnish Government just three weeks after the declaration. Finland achieved full sovereignty in May 1918 after a <a href="Finnish%20Civil%20War">4-month civil war</a>, with the conservative <a href="Whites%20%28Finland%29">Whites</a> winning over the socialist <a href="Finnish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Republic">Reds</a>, and the expulsion of Bolshevik troops.

Finland joined the League of Nations in 1920, from which it sought security guarantees, but Finland's primary goal was co-operation with the <a href="Scandinavian%20countries">Scandinavian countries</a>. The Finnish and Swedish militaries engaged in wide-ranging co-operation, but focused on the exchange of information and on defence planning for the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a> rather than on <a href="military%20exercise">military exercise</a>s or on stockpiling and deployment of <a href="materiel">materiel</a>. Nevertheless, the <a href="Government%20of%20Sweden">Government of Sweden</a> carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy. Finland's military policy included clandestine <a href="Finnish%E2%80%93Estonian%20defence%20cooperation">defence co-operation</a> with <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>.

The period after the Finnish Civil War till the early 1930s proved a politically unstable time in Finland due to the continued rivalry between the conservative and socialist parties. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Finland">Communist Party of Finland</a> was declared illegal in 1931, and the nationalist <a href="Lapua%20Movement">Lapua Movement</a> organised <a href="Anti-communism">anti-communist</a> violence, which culminated in a <a href="M%C3%A4nts%C3%A4l%C3%A4%20rebellion">failed coup attempt</a> in 1932. The successor of the Lapua Movement, the <a href="Patriotic%20People%27s%20Movement%20%28Finland%29">Patriotic People's Movement</a>, only had a minor presence in national politics with at most 14 seats out of 200 in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Finland">Finnish parliament</a>. By the late 1930s, the export-oriented Finnish economy was growing and the nation's extreme political movements had diminished.

After Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteers conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Soviet border, the <a href="Viena%20expedition">Viena</a> and <a href="Aunus%20expedition">Aunus expedition</a>s, to annex <a href="Karelia">Karelia</a>n areas according to the <a href="Greater%20Finland">Greater Finland</a> ideology of combining all <a href="Finnic%20peoples">Finnic peoples</a> into a single state. In 1920, Finnish communists based in the USSR attempted to assassinate the former Finnish <a href="White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29">White Guard</a> Commander-in-Chief, Marshal <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Emil%20Mannerheim">Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim</a>. On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tartu%20%28Russian%E2%80%93Finnish%29">Treaty of Tartu</a>, confirming the old border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Imperial Russia</a> proper as the new Finnish–Soviet border. Finland also received <a href="Petsamo%20Province">Petsamo</a>, with its <a href="ice-free%20harbour">ice-free harbour</a> on the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. Despite the signing of the treaty, relations between the two countries remained strained. The Finnish Government allowed volunteers to cross the border to support the <a href="East%20Karelian%20uprising%20and%20Soviet%E2%80%93Finnish%20conflict%20of%201921%E2%80%9322">East Karelian uprising</a> in Russia in 1921, and Finnish communists in the Soviet Union continued to prepare for a <a href="Revanchism">"revanche"</a> and staged a cross-border raid into Finland, called the <a href="Pork%20mutiny">Pork mutiny</a>, in 1922. In 1932, the USSR and Finland signed a <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Finnish%20Non-Aggression%20Pact">non-aggression pact</a>, which was reaffirmed for a ten-year period in 1934. While foreign trade in Finland was <a href="Business%20cycle">booming</a>, less than one percent of Finnish trade was with the Soviet Union. In 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.
<a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish revolution. He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements. During Stalin's rule, Soviet propaganda painted Finland's leadership as a "vicious and reactionary <a href="fascist">fascist</a> clique". Field Marshal Mannerheim and <a href="V%C3%A4in%C3%B6%20Tanner">Väinö Tanner</a>, the leader of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Finland">Finnish Social Democratic Party</a>, were targeted for particular scorn. When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the USSR changed its foreign policy toward Finland and began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier. The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire possessed the ideal amount of territorial security, and wanted the newly christened city of <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a>, only from the Finnish border, to enjoy a similar level of security against the rising power of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. In essence, the border between the Grand Duchy of Finland and Russia proper was never supposed to become international.

In April 1938, <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> agent <a href="Boris%20Yartsev">Boris Yartsev</a> contacted the Finnish Foreign Minister <a href="Rudolf%20Holsti">Rudolf Holsti</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Aimo%20Cajander">Aimo Cajander</a>, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather "advance to meet the enemy". Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> along the seaward approaches to Leningrad; Finland refused.

Negotiations continued throughout 1938 without results. Finnish reception of Soviet entreaties was decidedly cool, as the violent collectivisation and purges in Stalin's Soviet Union resulted in a poor opinion of the country. Most of the Finnish communist elite in the Soviet Union had been executed during the Great Purge, further tarnishing the USSR's image in Finland. At the same time, Finland was attempting to negotiate a military co-operation plan with Sweden and hoping to jointly defend the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a>.

The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. The pact was nominally a <a href="non-aggression%20treaty">non-aggression treaty</a>, but it included a secret protocol in which Eastern European countries were divided into <a href="spheres%20of%20interest">spheres of interest</a>. Finland fell into the Soviet sphere. On 1 September 1939, Germany <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">began its invasion of Poland</a> and two days later Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. On 17 September, the Soviet Union <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">invaded Eastern Poland</a>. The <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> were soon <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20of%20the%20Baltic%20states%20%281940%29">forced to accept treaties</a> allowing the USSR to establish military bases and to station troops on their soil. The Government of Estonia accepted the <a href="ultimatum">ultimatum</a>, signing the agreement in September. <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> followed in October. Unlike the Baltic states, Finland started a gradual <a href="mobilisation">mobilisation</a> under the guise of "additional <a href="refresher%20training">refresher training</a>." The Soviets had already started intensive mobilisation near the Finnish border in 1938–39. Assault troops thought necessary for the invasion did not begin deployment until October 1939. Operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November.

On 5 October 1939, the Soviet Union invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow for negotiations. <a href="Juho%20Kusti%20Paasikivi">J.K. Paasikivi</a>, the Finnish envoy to Sweden, was sent to Moscow to represent the Finnish Government. The Soviet delegation demanded that the border between the USSR and Finland on the <a href="Karelian%20Isthmus">Karelian Isthmus</a> be moved westward to a point only east of <a href="Vyborg">Vyborg</a> () and that Finland destroy all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus. Likewise, the delegation demanded the cession of islands in the Gulf of Finland as well as <a href="Rybachy%20Peninsula">Rybachy Peninsula</a> (). The Finns would have to lease the <a href="Hanko%20Peninsula">Hanko Peninsula</a> for thirty years and permit the Soviets to establish a <a href="military%20base">military base</a> there. In exchange, the Soviet Union would cede <a href="Repola">Repola</a> and <a href="Poraj%C3%A4rvi">Porajärvi</a> municipalities from <a href="Eastern%20Karelia">Eastern Karelia</a>, an area twice the size of the territory demanded from Finland.

The Soviet offer divided the Finnish Government, but was eventually rejected with respect to the opinion of the public and Parliament. On 31 October, Foreign Minister <a href="Vyacheslav%20Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</a> announced Soviet demands in public in the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Supreme Soviet</a>. The Finns made two counteroffers whereby Finland would cede the <a href="Terijoki">Terijoki</a> area to the Soviet Union, which would double the distance between Leningrad and the Finnish border, far less than the Soviets had demanded, as well as the islands in the Gulf of Finland.

On 26 November 1939, an incident was reported near the Soviet village of <a href="Mainila">Mainila</a>, close to the border with Finland. A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards. Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was a <a href="false%20flag">false flag</a> operation carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an NKVD unit with the purpose of providing the Soviet Union with a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" and a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact.

Molotov claimed that the incident was a Finnish artillery attack and demanded that Finland apologise for the incident and move its forces beyond a line away from the border. Finland denied responsibility for the attack, rejected the demands and called for a joint Finnish–Soviet commission to examine the incident. In turn, the Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, renounced the non-aggression pact and severed diplomatic relations with Finland on 28 November. In the following years, <a href="Soviet%20historiography">Soviet historiography</a> described the incident as Finnish provocation. Doubt on the official Soviet version was cast only in the late 1980s, during the policy of "<a href="glasnost">glasnost</a>". The issue continued to divide Russian historiography even after the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991.

In 2013, Russian President <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> stated at a meeting with military historians that the USSR launched the Winter War to "correct mistakes" made in determining the border with Finland after 1917. Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided: some sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer Finland in full, and cite the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols as proof of their conclusions. Hungarian historian István Ravasz wrote that the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee</a> had set out in 1939 that the former borders of the Tsarist Empire were to be restored—including Finland. American political scientist <a href="Dan%20Reiter">Dan Reiter</a> stated that the USSR "sought to impose a regime change" and thus "achieve absolute victory". He quotes Molotov, who commented in November 1939 on the regime-change plan to a Soviet ambassador that the new government "will not be Soviet, but one of a democratic republic. Nobody is going to set up Soviets over there, but we hope it will be a government we can come to terms with as to ensure the security of Leningrad."

Others argue against the idea of a complete Soviet conquest. American historian <a href="William%20R.%20Trotter">William R. Trotter</a> asserted that Stalin's objective was to secure Leningrad's flank from a possible German invasion through Finland. He stated that "the strongest argument" against a Soviet intention of full conquest is that it did not happen in either 1939 or during the Continuation War in 1944—even though Stalin "could have done so with comparative ease." Bradley Lightbody wrote that the "entire Soviet aim had been to make the Soviet border more secure." According to Russian historian A. Chubaryan in 2002, no documents had been found in Russian archives that support a Soviet plan to annex Finland. Rather, the objective was to gain Finnish territory and reinforce Soviet influence in the region.

Before the war, Soviet leadership expected total victory within a few weeks. The Red Army had just completed the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">invasion of Eastern Poland</a> at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west. Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician <a href="Andrei%20Zhdanov">Andrei Zhdanov</a> and military strategist <a href="Kliment%20Voroshilov">Kliment Voroshilov</a>, but other generals were more reserved. The <a href="chief%20of%20staff">Chief of Staff</a> of the Red Army <a href="Boris%20Shaposhnikov">Boris Shaposhnikov</a> advocated a fuller build-up, extensive <a href="fire%20support">fire support</a> and logistical preparations, and a rational <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a>, and the deployment of the army's best units. Zhdanov's military commander <a href="Kirill%20Meretskov">Kirill Meretskov</a> reported that "The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests [...] The proper use of our forces will be difficult." These doubts were not reflected in his troop deployments. Meretskov announced publicly that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at the most. Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border into Sweden by mistake.

Stalin's purges in the 1930s had devastated the officer corps of the Red Army; those purged included three of its five marshals, 220 of its 264 division or higher-level commanders, and 36,761 officers of all ranks. Fewer than half of all the officers remained. They were commonly replaced by soldiers who were less competent but more loyal to their superiors. Unit commanders were overseen by <a href="political%20commissar">political commissar</a>s, whose approval was needed to ratify military decisions and who evaluated those decisions based on their political merits. The dual system further complicated Soviet chain of command and annulled the independence of commanding officers.

After the Soviet success in the <a href="battles%20of%20Khalkhin%20Gol">battles of Khalkhin Gol</a> against Japan on the USSR's eastern border, Soviet high command had divided into two factions. One side was represented by <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> veterans General <a href="Pavel%20Rychagov">Pavel Rychagov</a> from the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Soviet Air Force</a>, tank expert General <a href="Dmitry%20Pavlov%20%28general%29">Dmitry Pavlov</a>, and Stalin's favourite general, Marshal <a href="Grigory%20Kulik">Grigory Kulik</a>, chief of artillery. The other was led by Khalkhin Gol veterans General <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a> of the Red Army and General <a href="Grigory%20Kravchenko">Grigory Kravchenko</a> of the Soviet Air Force. Under this divided command structure, the lessons of the Soviet Union's "first real war on a massive scale using tanks, artillery, and aircraft" at Khalkin Gol went unheeded. As a result, Russian <a href="BT%20tank">BT tank</a>s were less successful during the Winter War, and it took the Soviet Union three months and over a million men to accomplish what Zhukov did at Khalkhin Gol in ten days.

Soviet generals were impressed by the success of German "<a href="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>" <a href="Military%20tactics">tactics</a>. ' had been tailored to Central European conditions with a dense, well-mapped network of paved roads. Armies fighting in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a> had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armoured vehicle regiments. Finnish Army centres, by contrast, were deep inside the country. There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce; most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps. War correspondent <a href="John%20Langdon-Davies">John Langdon-Davies</a> observed the landscape as follows: "Every acre of its surface was created to be the despair of an attacking military force." Waging ' in Finland was a highly difficult proposition, and according to Trotter, the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical co-ordination and local initiative required to execute "" tactics in the Finnish theatre.

The Soviet forces were organised as follows:

The Finnish strategy was dictated by geography. The -long frontier with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of <a href="unpaved%20road">unpaved road</a>s. In pre-war calculations, the Finnish <a href="Defence%20Command%20%28Finland%29">Defence Command</a>, which had established its wartime Headquarters at <a href="Mikkeli">Mikkeli</a>, estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Karelian Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga. In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one. The true ratio was much higher; for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed to the north of Lake Ladoga.

An even greater problem than lack of soldiers was the lack of materiel; foreign shipments of anti-tank weapons and aircraft were arriving in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells, and fuel only to last 19–60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford <a href="Counter-battery%20fire">counterbattery</a> or <a href="saturation%20fire">saturation fire</a>. Finnish tank forces were operationally non-existent. The ammunition situation was alleviated somewhat since Finns were largely armed with <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> rifles dating from the Finnish Civil War, which used the same <a href="7.62%C3%9754mmR">7.62×54mmR</a> cartridge used by Soviet forces. Some Finnish soldiers maintained their ammunition supply by looting the bodies of dead Soviet soldiers.

The Finnish forces were positioned as follows:

On 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and <a href="Bombing%20of%20Helsinki%20in%20World%20War%20II%23Winter%20War">bombed Helsinki</a>, inflicting substantial damage and casualties. In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities, but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population, sarcastically dubbed <a href="Molotov%20bread%20basket">Molotov bread basket</a>s by Finns. The Finnish statesman J. K. Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a <a href="declaration%20of%20war">declaration of war</a> violated three separate non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed in 1932 and again in 1934, and also the <a href="Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations">Covenant of the League of Nations</a>, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934. Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Finnish%20Defence%20Forces">Finnish Defence Forces</a> after the Soviet attack. In a further reshuffling, <a href="Cajander%20III%20Cabinet">Aimo Cajander's caretaker cabinet</a> was replaced by <a href="Risto%20Ryti">Risto Ryti</a> and <a href="Ryti%20I%20Cabinet">his cabinet</a>, with Väinö Tanner as foreign minister, due to opposition to Cajander's pre-war politics. Finland brought the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations. The League expelled the USSR on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland.

On 1 December 1939, the Soviet Union formed a <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a>, called the <a href="Finnish%20Democratic%20Republic">Finnish Democratic Republic</a> and headed by <a href="Otto%20Wille%20Kuusinen">Otto Wille Kuusinen</a>, in the parts of Finnish Karelia occupied by the Soviets. Kuusinen's government was also referred to as the "Terijoki Government," after the village of Terijoki, the first settlement captured by the advancing Red Army. After the war, the puppet government was disbanded. From the very outset of the war, working-class Finns stood behind the legitimate government in Helsinki. Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the <a href="spirit%20of%20the%20Winter%20War">spirit of the Winter War</a>.

The Mannerheim Line, an array of Finnish defence structures, was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately from the Soviet border. The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns. The Finnish command deployed a <a href="defence%20in%20depth">defence in depth</a> of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line. In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks. The Finns had few <a href="anti-tank%20weapon">anti-tank weapon</a>s and insufficient training in modern <a href="Anti-tank%20warfare">anti-tank tactics</a>. According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited. The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the <a href="Bogie%23Tracked%20vehicles">bogie wheels</a> would often immobilise a tank. Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the <a href="Molotov%20cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>, a glass bottle filled with <a href="Flammability">flammable</a> liquids and with a simple hand-lit <a href="Fuse%20%28explosives%29">fuse</a>. Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish "<a href="Alko">Alko</a>" alcoholic beverage corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them. 80 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border zone engagements.

By 6 December, all of the Finnish covering forces had withdrawn to the Mannerheim Line. The Red Army began its first major attack against the Line in <a href="Solovyovo%2C%20Priozersky%20District%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast">Taipale</a>—the area between the shore of Lake Ladoga, the <a href="Burnaya%20River">Taipale river</a> and the <a href="Suvanto">Suvanto</a> waterway. Along the Suvanto sector, the Finns had a slight advantage of elevation and dry ground to dig into. The Finnish <a href="artillery">artillery</a> had scouted the area and made fire plans in advance, anticipating a Soviet assault. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Taipale">Battle of Taipale</a> began with a forty-hour Soviet artillery preparation. After the <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29">barrage</a>, Soviet infantry attacked across open ground but was repulsed with heavy casualties. From 6 December to 12 December, the Red Army continued to try to engage using only one division. Next, the Red Army strengthened its artillery and deployed tanks and the <a href="150th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Russia%29">150th Rifle Division</a> forward to the Taipale front. On 14 December, the bolstered Soviet forces launched a new attack but were pushed back again. A third Soviet division entered the fight but performed poorly and panicked under shell fire. The assaults continued without success, and the Red Army suffered heavy losses. One typical Soviet attack during the battle lasted just an hour but left 1,000 dead and 27 tanks strewn on the ice. North of Lake Ladoga on the <a href="Ladoga%20Karelia">Ladoga Karelia</a> front, the defending Finnish units relied on the terrain. Ladoga Karelia, a large forest wilderness, did not have road networks for the modern Red Army. The Soviet 8th Army had extended a new railroad line to the border, which could double the supply capability on the front. On 12 December, the advancing Soviet <a href="139th%20Rifle%20Division">139th Rifle Division</a>, supported by the <a href="56th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">56th Rifle Division</a>, was defeated by a much smaller Finnish force under <a href="Paavo%20Talvela">Paavo Talvela</a> in <a href="Battle%20of%20Tolvaj%C3%A4rvi">Tolvajärvi</a>, the first Finnish victory of the war.

In Central and Northern Finland, roads were few and the terrain hostile. The Finns did not expect large-scale Soviet attacks, but the Soviets sent eight divisions, heavily supported by armour and artillery. The <a href="155th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">155th Rifle Division</a> attacked at <a href="Lieksa">Lieksa</a>, and further north the <a href="44th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">44th</a> attacked at <a href="Kuhmo">Kuhmo</a>. The <a href="163rd%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">163rd Rifle Division</a> was deployed at <a href="Suomussalmi">Suomussalmi</a> and ordered to cut Finland in half by advancing on the Raate road. In <a href="Finnish%20Lapland">Finnish Lapland</a>, the Soviet <a href="88th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">88th</a> and <a href="122nd%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">122nd Rifle Divisions</a> attacked at <a href="Salla">Salla</a>. The Arctic port of Petsamo was attacked by the <a href="104th%20Mountain%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">104th Mountain Rifle Division</a> by sea and land, supported by <a href="Naval%20gunfire%20support">naval gunfire</a>.

The winter of 1939–40 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of on 16 January 1940. At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in <a href="Active%20duty">active service</a> had <a href="uniforms">uniforms</a> and <a href="weapons">weapons</a>. The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with a semblance of insignia added. Finnish soldiers were skilled in <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a>. The cold, snow, forest, and long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could use to their advantage. The Finns dressed in layers, and the <a href="Ski%20warfare">ski troopers</a> wore a lightweight white snow cape. This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible as the Finns executed <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla attacks</a> against Soviet columns. At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard <a href="olive%20drab">olive drab</a> and men dressed in regular <a href="khaki">khaki</a> uniforms. Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue <a href="snowsuit">snowsuit</a>s to their infantry.

Most Soviet soldiers had proper winter clothes, but this was not the case with every unit. In the <a href="battle%20of%20Suomussalmi">battle of Suomussalmi</a>, thousands of Soviet soldiers died of <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a>. The Soviet troops also lacked skill in skiing, so soldiers were restricted to movement by road and were forced to move in long columns. The Red Army lacked proper winter tents, and troops had to sleep in improvised shelters. Some Soviet units incurred frostbite casualties as high as ten percent even before crossing the Finnish border. The cold weather did confer an advantage to Soviet tanks, as they could move over frozen terrain and bodies of water, rather than being immobilised in swamps and mud. According to Krivosheev, at least 61,506 Soviet troops were sick or <a href="frostbitten">frostbitten</a> during the war.

In battles from Ladoga Karelia to the Arctic port of <a href="Battle%20of%20Petsamo%20%281939%29">Petsamo</a>, the Finns used <a href="guerrilla%20tactics">guerrilla tactics</a>. The Red Army was superior in numbers and materiel, but Finns used the advantages of speed, <a href="manoeuvre%20warfare">manoeuvre warfare</a> and <a href="economy%20of%20force">economy of force</a>. Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the <a href="battle%20of%20Raate%20road">battle of Raate road</a>, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces. With Soviet forces divided into smaller groups, the Finns dealt with them individually and attacked from all sides.

For many of the encircled Soviet troops in a <a href="Pocket%20%28military%29">pocket</a> (called a "<a href="Pocket%20%28military%29%23Motti">motti</a>" in Finnish, originally meaning of firewood), staying alive was an ordeal comparable to combat. The men were freezing and starving and endured poor sanitary conditions. Historian William R. Trotter described these conditions as follows: "The Soviet soldier had no choice. If he refused to fight, he would be shot. If he tried to sneak through the forest, he would freeze to death. And surrender was no option for him; Soviet propaganda had told him how the Finns would torture prisoners to death."

The terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water. Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the <a href="Maginot%20Line">Maginot Line</a>. Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered <a href="Dugout%20%28military%29">dugouts</a>. The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s. Many were extended in the late 1930s. Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced-concrete</a> bunker per kilometre. Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe. According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was the "stubborn defenders with a lot of "<a href="sisu">sisu</a>"" – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as "<a href="Courage">guts, fighting spirit</a>."

On the eastern side of the Isthmus, the Red Army attempted to break through the Mannerheim Line at the battle of Taipale. On the western side, Soviet units faced the Finnish line at Summa, near the city of <a href="Viipuri">Vyborg</a>, on 16 December. The Finns had built 41 reinforced-concrete bunkers in the Summa area, making the defensive line in this area stronger than anywhere else on the Karelian Isthmus. Because of a mistake in planning, the nearby Munasuo swamp had a -wide gap in the line. During the first <a href="battle%20of%20Summa">battle of Summa</a>, a number of Soviet tanks broke through the thin line on 19 December, but the Soviets could not benefit from the situation because of insufficient co-operation between branches of service. The Finns remained in their trenches, allowing the Soviet tanks to move freely behind the Finnish line, as the Finns had no proper anti-tank weapons. The Finns succeeded in repelling the main Soviet assault. The tanks, stranded behind enemy lines, attacked the strongpoints at random until they were eventually destroyed, 20 in all. By 22 December, the battle ended in a Finnish victory.

The Soviet advance was stopped at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops suffered from poor morale and a shortage of supplies, eventually refusing to participate in more <a href="Human%20wave%20attack">suicidal frontal attacks</a>. The Finns, led by General <a href="Harald%20%C3%96hquist">Harald Öhquist</a>, decided to launch a counter-attack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a "motti" near Vyborg on 23 December. Öhquist's plan was bold, and it failed. The Finns lost 1,300 men, and the Soviets were later estimated to have lost a similar number.

The strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga in Ladoga Karelia surprised the Finnish Headquarters. Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by <a href="Lauri%20Tiainen">Lauri Tiainen</a> and the 13th Division led by <a href="Hannu%20Hannuksela">Hannu Hannuksela</a>. They also had a support group of three <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s, bringing their total strength to over 30,000. The Soviets deployed a <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border. The 8th Army was led by <a href="Ivan%20Nikitich%20Khabarov">Ivan Khabarov</a>, who was replaced by <a href="Grigori%20Shtern">Grigori Shtern</a> on 13 December. The Soviets' mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between <a href="Sortavala">Sortavala</a> and <a href="Joensuu">Joensuu</a> within 10 days. The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery, as well as <a href="air%20supremacy">air supremacy</a>.

Finnish forces panicked and retreated in front of the overwhelming Red Army. The commander of the Finnish IV Army Corps Juho Heiskanen was replaced by Woldemar Hägglund on 4 December. On 7 December, in the middle of the Ladoga Karelian front, Finnish units retreated near the small stream of Kollaa. The waterway itself did not offer protection, but alongside it, there were <a href="ridge">ridge</a>s up to high. The ensuing <a href="battle%20of%20Kollaa">battle of Kollaa</a> lasted until the end of the war. A memorable quote, "Kollaa holds" () became a legendary motto among Finns. Further contributing to the legend of Kollaa was the sniper <a href="Simo%20H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4">Simo Häyhä</a>, dubbed "the White Death" by Soviets, and credited with over 250 kills. To the north, the Finns retreated from <a href="%C3%84gl%C3%A4j%C3%A4rvi">Ägläjärvi</a> to <a href="Tolvaj%C3%A4rvi">Tolvajärvi</a> on 5 December and then repelled a Soviet offensive in the battle of Tolvajärvi on 11 December.

In the south, two Soviet divisions were united on the northern side of the Lake Ladoga coastal road. As before, these divisions were trapped as the more mobile Finnish units counterattacked from the north to flank the Soviet columns. On 19 December, the Finns temporarily ceased their assaults due to exhaustion. It was not until the period of 6–16 January 1940 that the Finns resumed their offensive, dividing Soviet divisions into smaller "mottis." Contrary to Finnish expectations, the encircled Soviet divisions did not try to break through to the east but instead entrenched. They were expecting reinforcements and supplies to <a href="airlift">arrive by air</a>. As the Finns lacked the necessary heavy artillery equipment and were short of men, they often did not directly attack the "mottis" they had created; instead, they worked to eliminate only the most dangerous threats. Often the "motti" tactic was not applied as a strategy, but as a Finnish adaptation to the behaviour of Soviet troops under fire. In spite of the cold and hunger, the Soviet troops did not surrender easily but fought bravely, often entrenching their tanks to be used as <a href="Pillbox%20%28military%29">pillboxes</a> and building timber dugouts. Some specialist Finnish soldiers were called in to attack the "mottis"; the most famous of them was Major <a href="Matti%20Aarnio">Matti Aarnio</a>, or "Motti-Matti" as he became known.

In Northern Karelia, Soviet forces were outmanoeuvred at <a href="Ilomantsi">Ilomantsi</a> and Lieksa. The Finns used effective guerrilla tactics, taking special advantage of their superior skiing skills and snow-white <a href="layered%20clothing">layered clothing</a> and executing surprise ambushes and raids. By the end of December, the Soviets decided to retreat and transfer resources to more critical fronts.

The Suomussalmi–Raate engagement was a double operation which would later be used by <a href="Military%20academy">military academics</a> as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary. Suomussalmi was a town of 4,000 with long lakes, wild forests and few roads. The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack here, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of <a href="Oulu">Oulu</a> and effectively cut Finland in two. There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road.

The battle of Raate road, which occurred during the month-long battle of Suomussalmi, resulted in one of the largest Soviet losses in the Winter War. The Soviet 44th and parts of the 163rd Rifle Division, comprising about 14,000 troops, were almost completely destroyed by a Finnish ambush as they marched along the forest road. A small unit blocked the Soviet advance while Finnish Colonel <a href="Hjalmar%20Siilasvuo">Hjalmar Siilasvuo</a> and his 9th Division cut off the retreat route, split the enemy force into smaller "mottis", and then proceeded to destroy the remnants <a href="Defeat%20in%20detail">in detail</a> as they retreated. The Soviets suffered 7,000–9,000 casualties; the Finnish units, 400. The Finnish troops captured dozens of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, hundreds of trucks, almost 2,000 horses, thousands of rifles, and much-needed ammunition and medical supplies.

In Finnish <a href="Lapland%20%28Finland%29">Lapland</a>, the forests gradually thin until in the north there are no trees at all. Thus, the area offers more room for tank deployment, but it is sparsely populated and experiences copious snowfall. The Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols, but instead, the Soviets sent full divisions. On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the <a href="Lapland%20Group">Lapland Group</a> from the North Finland Group. The group was placed under the command of <a href="Kurt%20Martti%20Wallenius">Kurt Wallenius</a>.

In Southern Lapland, near the village of Salla, the Soviet 88th and 122nd Divisions, totalling 35,000 men, advanced. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salla%20%281939%29">battle of Salla</a>, the Soviets proceeded easily to Salla, where the road forked. The northern branch moved toward <a href="Pelkosenniemi">Pelkosenniemi</a> while the rest approached <a href="Kemij%C3%A4rvi">Kemijärvi</a>. On 17 December, the Soviet northern group, comprising an infantry regiment, a battalion, and a company of tanks, was outflanked by a Finnish <a href="battalion">battalion</a>. The 122nd retreated, abandoning much of its heavy equipment and vehicles. Following this success, the Finns shuttled reinforcements to the defensive line in front of Kemijärvi. The Soviets hammered the defensive line without success. The Finns counter-attacked, and the Soviets retreated to a new defensive line where they stayed for the rest of the war.

To the north was Finland's only ice-free <a href="port">port</a> in the Arctic, Petsamo. The Finns lacked the manpower to defend it fully, as the main front was distant at the Karelian Isthmus. In the battle of Petsamo, the Soviet 104th Division attacked the Finnish 104th Independent Cover Company. The Finns abandoned Petsamo and concentrated on delaying actions. The area was treeless, windy, and relatively low, offering little defensible terrain. The <a href="polar%20night">almost constant darkness</a> and extreme temperatures of the Lapland winter benefited the Finns, who executed guerrilla attacks against Soviet supply lines and patrols. As a result, the Soviet movements were halted by the efforts of one-fifth as many Finns.

The USSR enjoyed <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> throughout the war. The <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a>, supporting the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common type being <a href="Tupolev%20SB">Tupolev SB</a>), was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped. The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland offered few valuable targets for <a href="strategic%20bombing">strategic bombing</a>. Often, targets were village depots with little value. The country had few modern highways in the interior, therefore making the railways the main targets for bombers. <a href="Rail%20track">Rail track</a>s were cut thousands of times but the Finns hastily repaired them and service resumed within a matter of hours. The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February instituted more effective tactics.

The largest bombing raid against the capital of Finland, <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, occurred on the first day of the war. The capital was bombed only a few times thereafter. All in all, Soviet bombings cost Finland five percent of its total man-hour production. Nevertheless, Soviet air attacks affected thousands of civilians, killing 957. The Soviets recorded 2,075 bombing attacks in 516 localities. The city of Vyborg, a major Soviet objective close to the Karelian Isthmus front, was almost levelled by nearly 12,000 bombs. No attacks on civilian targets were mentioned in Soviet radio or newspaper reports. In January 1940, the Soviet "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" newspaper continued to stress that no civilian targets in Finland had been struck, even accidentally. It is estimated that the Soviet air force lost about 400 aircraft because of inclement weather, lack of fuel and tools, and during transport to the front. The Soviet Air Force flew approximately 44,000 sorties during the war.

At the beginning of the war, Finland had a small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty. Missions were limited, and <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers. Strategic bombings doubled as opportunities for military <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>. Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft offered little support for Finnish ground troops. In spite of losses, the number of planes in the <a href="Finnish%20Air%20Force">Finnish Air Force</a> rose by over 50 percent by the end of the war. The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft.

Finnish fighter pilots often flew their motley collection of planes into Soviet formations that outnumbered them 10 or even 20 times. Finnish fighters shot down a confirmed 200 Soviet aircraft, while losing 62 of their own. Finnish anti-aircraft guns downed more than 300 enemy aircraft. Often, a Finnish forward <a href="air%20base">air base</a> consisted of a frozen lake, a <a href="windsock">windsock</a>, a telephone set and some tents. Air-raid warnings were given by Finnish women organised by the <a href="Lotta%20Sv%C3%A4rd">Lotta Svärd</a>.

There was little naval activity during the Winter War. The <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> began to freeze over by the end of December, impeding the movement of <a href="warship">warship</a>s; by mid-winter, only <a href="ice%20breaker">ice breaker</a>s and <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s could still move. The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> forces in the area. The <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> to undertake large-scale operations. The Baltic Fleet possessed two <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, one <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>, almost 20 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, 50 <a href="motor%20torpedo%20boat">motor torpedo boat</a>s, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Soviets used naval bases in <a href="Paldiski">Paldiski</a>, <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a> and <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Liepāja</a> for their operations.

The <a href="Finnish%20Navy">Finnish Navy</a> was a coastal defence force with two <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a>s, five submarines, four <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s, seven motor torpedo boats, one <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> and six <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>. The two coastal defence ships, and , were moved to harbour in <a href="Turku">Turku</a> where they were used to bolster the air defence. Their anti-aircraft guns shot down one or two planes over the city, and the ships remained there for the rest of the war. As well as coastal defence, the Finnish Navy protected the Åland islands and Finnish <a href="merchant%20vessel">merchant vessel</a>s in the Baltic Sea.

Soviet aircraft bombed Finnish vessels and harbours and dropped <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> into Finnish <a href="sea%20lane">seaways</a>. Still, only five merchant ships were lost to Soviet action. World War II, which had started before the Winter War, proved more costly for the Finnish merchant vessels, with 26 lost due to hostile action in 1939 and 1940.

Finnish coastal artillery batteries defended important harbours and naval bases. Most batteries were left over from the Imperial Russian period, with guns being the most numerous. Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a gun battery originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side.

The first naval battle occurred in the Gulf of Finland on 1 December, near the island of <a href="Russar%C3%B6">Russarö</a>, south of <a href="Hanko">Hanko</a>. That day, the weather was fair and visibility, excellent. The Finns spotted the Soviet cruiser and two destroyers. When the ships were at a range of , the Finns opened fire with four coastal guns. After five minutes of firing by the coastal guns, the cruiser had been damaged by near misses and retreated. The destroyers remained undamaged, but the "Kirov" suffered 17 dead and 30 wounded. The Soviets already knew the locations of the Finnish coastal batteries, but were surprised by their range.

Coastal artillery had a greater effect on land by reinforcing defence in conjunction with army artillery. Two sets of fortress artillery made significant contributions to the early battles on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ladoga Karelia. These were located at <a href="Kaarnajoki">Kaarnajoki</a> on the Eastern Isthmus and at <a href="Mantsinsaari%20Island">Mantsi</a> on the northeastern shore of Lake Ladoga. The fortress of <a href="Primorsk%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast">Koivisto</a> provided similar support from the southwestern coast of the Isthmus.

Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December in the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was working hard to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland. Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov was given full authority over operations in the Finnish theatre, and he ordered the suspension of frontal assaults in late December. Kliment Voroshilov was replaced with <a href="Semyon%20Timoshenko">Semyon Timoshenko</a> as the commander of the Soviet forces in the war on 7 January.

The main focus of the Soviet attack was switched to the Karelian Isthmus. Timoshenko and Zhdanov reorganised and tightened control between different branches of service in the Red Army. They also changed tactical doctrines to meet the realities of the situation. All Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus were divided into two armies: the 7th and the 13th Army. The 7th Army, now under Kirill Meretskov, would concentrate 75 percent of its strength against the stretch of the Mannerheim Line between <a href="Solovyovo%2C%20Priozersky%20District%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast">Taipale</a> and the Munasuo swamp. Tactics would be basic: an armoured wedge for the initial breakthrough, followed by the main infantry and vehicle assault force. The Red Army would prepare by pinpointing the Finnish frontline fortifications. The <a href="123rd%20Rifle%20Division">123rd Rifle Division</a> then rehearsed the assault on life-size <a href="mockup">mock-up</a>s. The Soviets shipped large numbers of new tanks and artillery pieces to the theatre. Troops were increased from ten divisions to 25–26 divisions with six or seven tank brigades and several independent tank platoons as support, totalling 600,000 soldiers. On 1 February, the Red Army began a large offensive, firing 300,000 shells into the Finnish line in the first 24 hours of the <a href="bombardment">bombardment</a>.

Although the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets increased bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>. The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies. Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks. On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments.

Although the Soviets refined their tactics and morale improved, the generals were still willing to accept massive losses in order to reach their objectives. Attacks were screened by smoke, heavy artillery, and armour support, but the infantry charged in the open and in dense formations. Unlike their tactics in December, Soviet tanks advanced in smaller numbers. The Finns could not easily eliminate tanks if infantry troops protected them. After 10 days of constant artillery barrage, the Soviets achieved a breakthrough on the Western Karelian Isthmus in the second battle of Summa.

On 11 February, the Soviets had approximately 460,000 soldiers, 3,350 artillery pieces, 3,000 tanks and 1,300 aircraft deployed on the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army was constantly receiving new recruits after the breakthrough. Opposing them, the Finns had eight divisions, totalling about 150,000 soldiers. One by one, the defenders' strongholds crumbled under the Soviet attacks and the Finns were forced to retreat. On 15 February, Mannerheim authorised a general retreat of the II Corps to a fallback line of defence. On the eastern side of the isthmus, the Finns continued to resist Soviet assaults, repelling them in the battle of Taipale.

Although the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond. In early January, Finnish communist <a href="Hella%20Wuolijoki">Hella Wuolijoki</a> contacted the Finnish Government. She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union's ambassador to Sweden, <a href="Alexandra%20Kollontai">Alexandra Kollontai</a>. Wuolijoki departed for <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel. Soon Molotov decided to extend recognition to the Ryti–Tanner government as the legal government of Finland and put an end to the puppet <a href="Terijoki%20Government">Terijoki Government</a> of Kuusinen that the Soviets had set up.

By mid-February, it became clear that the Finnish forces were rapidly approaching exhaustion. For the Soviets, casualties were high, the situation was a source of political embarrassment to the Soviet regime, and there was a risk of <a href="Franco-British%20plans%20for%20intervention%20in%20the%20Winter%20War">Franco-British intervention</a>. With the spring thaw approaching, the Soviet forces risked becoming bogged down in the forests. Finnish Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner arrived in Stockholm on 12 February and negotiated the peace terms with the Soviets through the Swedes. German representatives, not aware that the negotiations were underway, suggested on 17 February that Finland negotiate with the Soviet Union.

Both Germany and Sweden were keen to see an end to the Winter War. The Germans feared losing the <a href="Swedish%20iron-ore%20mining%20during%20World%20War%20II">iron ore fields in Northern Sweden</a> and threatened to attack at once if the Swedes granted the Allied forces <a href="right%20of%20passage">right of passage</a>. The Germans even had an invasion plan against Scandinavian countries, called "Studie Nord", which later became the full <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">Operation "Weserübung"</a>. As the Finnish Cabinet hesitated in the face of harsh Soviet conditions, Sweden's King <a href="Gustav%20V%20of%20Sweden">Gustav V</a> made a <a href="statsr%C3%A5dsdiktamen%20by%20Gustaf%20V">public statement</a> on 19 February in which he confirmed having declined Finnish pleas for support from Swedish troops. On 25 February, the Soviet peace terms were spelt out in detail. On 29 February, the Finnish Government accepted the Soviet terms in principle and was willing to enter into negotiations.

On 5 March, the Red Army advanced past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of <a href="Viipuri%20Province">Vyborg</a>. The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western <a href="Gulf%20of%20Viipuri">Gulf of Vyborg</a>. The Finns proposed an <a href="armistice">armistice</a> on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish Government, declined the offer. The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. The USSR made further demands as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, noting that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms.

The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940. A <a href="cease-fire">cease-fire</a> took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11 a.m. Helsinki time. With it, Finland ceded a portion of Karelia, the entire Karelian Isthmus and land north of Lake Ladoga. The area included Finland's second-largest city of Vyborg, much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland's military—all in all, 11 percent of the territory and 30 percent of the economic assets of pre-war Finland. Twelve percent of Finland's population, 422,000 Karelians, <a href="Evacuation%20of%20Finnish%20Karelia">were evacuated and lost their homes</a>. Finland ceded a part of the region of <a href="Salla">Salla</a>, Rybachy Peninsula in the <a href="Barents%20Sea">Barents Sea</a>, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years. The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty.

Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded <a href="Background%20of%20the%20Winter%20War%23Soviet%20demands%20in%20late%201939">Soviet pre-war demands</a>. Before the war, the Soviet Union demanded that the frontier between the USSR and Finland on the Karelian Isthmus be moved westward to a point east of Vyborg to the line between Koivisto and <a href="Khiytola">Lipola</a>, that existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus be demolished, and the islands of <a href="Suursaari">Suursaari</a>, <a href="Tyt%C3%A4rsaari">Tytärsaari</a>, and <a href="Beryozovye%20Islands">Koivisto</a> in the Gulf of Finland and Rybachy Peninsula be ceded. In exchange, the Soviet Union proposed ceding Repola and Porajärvi from Eastern Karelia, an area twice as large as the territories originally demanded from the Finns.

World opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified. World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest. Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland. Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through Sweden to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

The largest foreign contingent came from neighbouring Sweden, which provided nearly 8,760 volunteers during the war. The <a href="Swedish%20Volunteer%20Corps%20%28Winter%20War%29">Swedish Volunteer Corps</a>, formed of Swedes, Norwegians (727 soldiers) and Danes (1,010 soldiers), fought on the northern front at Salla during the last weeks of the war. A Swedish unit of <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a> fighters, named "the Flight Regiment 19" also participated. Swedish anti-air batteries with <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors guns</a> were responsible for air defence in northern Finland and the city of Turku. Volunteers arrived from <a href="Hungarian%20Volunteers%20in%20the%20Winter%20War">Hungary</a>, Italy and Estonia. 350 <a href="Finnish%20American">American nationals of Finnish background</a> volunteered, and 210 volunteers of other nationalities arrived in Finland before the war ended. <a href="Max%20Manus">Max Manus</a>, a <a href="Norwegian%20people">Norwegian</a>, fought in the Winter War before returning to <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and later achieved fame as a resistance fighter during the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">German occupation of Norway</a>. In total, Finland received 12,000 volunteers, 50 of whom died during the war. The British actor <a href="Christopher%20Lee">Christopher Lee</a> volunteered in the war for two weeks, but did not face combat.

France had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War. The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's major ally via a Finnish attack on the Soviet Union. France had another motive, preferring to have a major war in a remote part of Europe rather than on French soil. France planned to re‑arm the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish exile units</a> and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo. Another proposal was a massive air strike with <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> co-operation against the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a>s.

The British, for their part, wanted to block the flow of iron ore from Swedish mines to Germany as the Swedes supplied up to 40 percent of Germany's iron demand. The matter was raised by British Admiral <a href="Reginald%20Plunkett">Reginald Plunkett</a> on 18 September 1939, and the next day <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> brought up the subject in the <a href="Chamberlain%20war%20ministry">Chamberlain War Cabinet</a>. On 11 December, Churchill opined that the British should gain a foothold in Scandinavia with the objective to help the Finns, but without a war with the Soviet Union. Because of the heavy German reliance on Northern Sweden's iron ore, Hitler had made it clear to the Swedish government in December that any Allied troops on Swedish soil would immediately provoke a German invasion.

On 19 December, French Prime Minister <a href="%C3%89douard%20Daladier">Édouard Daladier</a> introduced his plan to the General Staff and the War Cabinet. In his plan, Daladier created linkage between the war in Finland and the <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> in Sweden. There was a danger of Finland's possible fall under Soviet hegemony. In turn, Nazi Germany could occupy both Norway and Sweden. These two dictatorships could divide Scandinavia between them, as they had already done with Poland. The main motivation of the French and the British were to reduce the German war-making ability.

The Military Co-ordination Committee met on 20 December in London, and two days later the French plan was put forward. The <a href="Anglo-French%20Supreme%20War%20Council">Anglo-French Supreme War Council</a> elected to send notes to Norway and Sweden on 27 December, urging the Norwegians and Swedes to help Finland and offer the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> their support. Norway and Sweden rejected the offer on 5 January 1940. The Allies came up with a new plan, in which they would demand that Norway and Sweden give them right of passage by citing a League of Nations resolution as justification. The expedition troops would disembark at the Norwegian port of Narvik and proceed by rail toward Finland, passing through the Swedish ore fields on the way. This demand was sent to Norway and Sweden on 6 January, but it was likewise rejected six days later.

Stymied but not yet dissuaded from the possibility of action, the Allies formulated a final plan on 29 January. First, the Finns would make a formal request for assistance. Then, the Allies would ask Norway and Sweden for permission to move the "volunteers" across their territory. Finally, in order to protect the supply line from German actions, the Allies would send units ashore at <a href="Namsos%20%28town%29">Namsos</a>, <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, and <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. The operation would have required 100,000 British and 35,000 French soldiers with naval and air support. The supply convoys would sail on 12 March and the landings would begin on 20 March. The end of the war on 13 March cancelled Franco-British plans to send troops to Finland through Northern <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.

The 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland. Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German blockade had prevented most armament shipments. The 15-month period between the Winter War and the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>-connected <a href="Continuation%20War">Continuation War</a> was later called the <a href="Interim%20Peace">Interim Peace</a>. After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish Army on the Karelian Isthmus became a subject of debate in Finland. Orders had already been issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been delayed by retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a few weeks, or to a couple of months at most. Karelian evacuees established an interest group, the <a href="Karjalan%20Liitto">Finnish Karelian League</a>, after the war to defend Karelian rights and interests, and to find a way to <a href="Karelian%20question">return ceded regions of Karelia</a> to Finland. In 1940, Finland and Sweden conducted negotiations for a military alliance, but the negotiations ended once it became clear that both Germany and the Soviet Union opposed such an alliance. During the Interim Peace, Finland established close ties with Germany in hopes of a chance to reclaim areas ceded to the Soviet Union.

Immediately after the war, Helsinki officially announced 19,576 dead. According to revised estimates in 2005 by Finnish historians, 25,904 people died or went missing and 43,557 were wounded on the Finnish side during the war. Finnish and Russian researchers have estimated that there were 800–1,100 <a href="Finnish%20prisoners%20of%20war%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Finnish prisoners of war</a>, of whom between 10 and 20 percent died. The Soviet Union repatriated 847 Finns after the War. Air raids killed 957 civilians. Between 20 and 30 tanks were destroyed and 62 aircraft were lost.

The Soviet General Staff Supreme Command ("<a href="Stavka">Stavka</a>") met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign, and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. Not all of the reforms had been completed by the time Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 15 months later.

During the period between the Winter War and "<a href="perestroika">perestroika</a>" in the late 1980s, Soviet historiography relied solely on Vyacheslav Molotov's speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried to negotiate guarantees of security for <a href="Saint-Petersburg">Leningrad</a> for two months. The Finns had taken a hostile stance to "please foreign imperialists". Finland had undertaken military provocation, and the Soviet Union could no longer abide by non-aggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union did not want to occupy or annex Finland; the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.

The official Soviet figure in 1940 for their dead was 48,745. More recent Russian estimates vary: in 1990, <a href="Mikhail%20Semiryaga">Mikhail Semiryaga</a> claimed 53,522 dead and <a href="N.%20I.%20Baryshnikov">N. I. Baryshnikov</a>, 53,500 dead. In 1997, <a href="Grigoriy%20Krivosheyev">Grigoriy Krivosheyev</a> claimed 126,875 dead and missing, and total casualties of 391,783 with 188,671 wounded. In 1991, <a href="Yuri%20Kilin">Yuri Kilin</a> claimed 63,990 dead and total casualties of 271,528. In 2007, he revised the estimate of dead to 134,000 and in 2012, he updated the estimate to 138,533 irretrievable losses. In 2013, <a href="Pavel%20Petrov%20%28historian%29">Pavel Petrov</a> stated that the Russian State Military Archive has a database confirming 167,976 killed or missing along with the soldiers' names, dates of birth, and ranks. There were 5,572 <a href="Soviet%20prisoners%20of%20war%20in%20Finland">Soviet prisoners of war in Finland</a>. The prisoners' fate after repatriation is unclear—Western sources suspect they were killed at NKVD camps.

Between 1,200 and 3,543 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The official figure was 611 tank casualties, but Yuri Kilin found a note received by the head of the Soviet General Staff, Boris Shaposhnikov, which reports 3,543 tank casualties and 316 tanks destroyed. According to the Finnish historian <a href="Ohto%20Manninen">Ohto Manninen</a>, the 7th Soviet Army lost 1,244 tanks during the breakthrough battles of the Mannerheim Line in mid-winter. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Finnish estimate of the number of lost Soviet tanks was 1,000–1,200. The Soviet Air Forces lost around 1,000 aircraft, but less than half of them were combat casualties.

The Winter War was a political success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. The German policy of neutrality was not popular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered. After the Peace of Moscow, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks <a href="Axis%20powers">Finno-German relations</a> were at the top of the agenda. More importantly, the very poor performance of the Red Army convinced Hitler that an <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">attack on the Soviet Union</a> would be successful. In June 1941, Hitler declared, 'we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down'.

The Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army as well as of the Allies. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the <a href="%C3%89douard%20Daladier%23Daladier%27s%20third%20ministry%2C%2010%20April%201938%20%E2%80%93%2021%20March%201940">Daladier Government</a> in France.
